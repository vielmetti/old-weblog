&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalculture.org/nominate.html&#34;&gt;Nominate your favorite for Best of Tech 2007 today.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php/2007/12/05/whats-the-best-tech-stuff/&#34;&gt;from Steven Levy:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
As I’ve mentioned earlier, I had the honor and pleasure of editing The Best of Technology Writing, 2007, an anthology published by the digitalculture imprint of the University of Michigan Press. For those who want to dip in and sample, the contents are available online. Or you can get it sent to you, piece by piece to read on your iPhone or Blackberry or on email, via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailylit.com/about&#34;&gt;DailyLit&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Here is where you can read my introduction, where I talk about how technology writing has changed in the past twenty years. I also address where tech writing stands vis a vis mainstream media versus blogs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am also delighted to hand over the editing chores for the next volume of the series to Clive Thompson. Reading over the stories for possible selection in this year’s volume, there were several of his that were totally worthy of inclusion. (The one I chose was a terrific story about Gordon Bell’s scheme to preserve our memories.) Clive is a great choice to edit The Best of Technology Writing 2008. But he needs your help. What were the best tech stories you read (or wrote) this year, either online or off? Please send your nominations here.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailylit.com/about&#34;&gt;DailyLit is books by email - their about us says
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
We got the idea for DailyLit after the New York Times serialized a few classic works in special supplements a few summers ago. We wound up reading books that we had always meant to simply by virtue of making them part of our daily routine of reading the newspaper. The only thing we do more consistenly than read the paper is read email. Bingo! We put together a first version and began reading &amp;ldquo;War of the Worlds&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pride and Prejudice&amp;rdquo;. We showed it to friends, added more books and features at their request, and presto, DailyLit was born.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Clive Thompson, the 2007 editor, is an awesome writer who blogs at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.collisiondetection.net/&#34;&gt;Collision Detection&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what he has to say about this year&amp;rsquo;s submissions:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Taking a cue from the open-source movement, we&amp;rsquo;re asking readers to nominate their favorite tech-oriented articles, essays, and blog posts from 2007. The competition is open to any and every technology topic&amp;ndash;biotech, information technology, gadgetry, tech policy, Silicon Valley, and software engineering are all fair game. But the ideal candidates will:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;    * be engagingly written for a mass audience;
&lt;br /&gt;    * be no longer than 5,000 words;
&lt;br /&gt;    * have been published between January and December, 2007.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
