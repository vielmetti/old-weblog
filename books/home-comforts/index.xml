      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laundry is a chore. I&amp;#39;m only slowly getting better at it after most of
a year of having increasing responsibilities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Mama mama make me clean. Every day the same routine.&amp;#0160;
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=SWX2jBT6Cm0C&#34;&gt;Jean Marzollo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important part of doing laundry once you start it is to figure
out what the cycle time is that you need to keep up to make continuous
progress, and then work with that timing in mind as you plan your
effort. If your washing machine takes 45 minutes to run, then going
downstairs 30 minutes later is a wasted trip, and going down an hour
later slows down system throughput considerably.&amp;#0160; No one yet that I know is using any web based time to change the laundry app that monitors your appliance directly, but simple timers or even just knowing that the top of the hour is when you go down to work on it should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laundry works best when clothes and wash are sorted before they get
dumped into the washer. This suggests that every time you put in a load
you should immediately sort the next load, so that there&amp;#39;s no need to
wait any more time that you need to the next time the cycle runs.
Sorting is made a lot easier by having big clearly labeled baskets. (I
never have figured out the symbols.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One school of laundry thought says to do a load every day; the other
says to do all the wash you have to do once a week in a continuous
stream. What is best for you depends on how many kids there are getting
clothes dirty, how many days or weeks of little boy clothing you have
in your stockpile so that there&amp;#39;s always a dry pair of clean pants
during mud puddle season, and what kind of mindless work you can do
while folding. In any case, there&amp;#39;s little to be gained from making
laundry a random process - routines repeated every week make it all
easier.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2:00pm; I promised myself that I&amp;#39;d go to the basement every hour
on the hour and move the process forwards. If I work at this properly
it will take less than 15 minutes to get the next load in and then I&amp;#39;ll
be able to have another 45 minutes of writing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More reading, should you need to, falls in two rather distinct camps: the domestic diva enthusiasm as seen on &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#flylady&#34;&gt;#flylady&lt;/a&gt; , or the art and science of keeping home exemplified by &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com/search?q=cheryl+mendelson+home+comforts&#34;&gt;Cheryl Mendelson&amp;#39;s Home Comforts&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160; Either way there&amp;#39;s method in the madness, and I haven&amp;#39;t even touched on the strategies of sending all of your wash out to be done, or taking it all to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Laundromats&#34;&gt;laundromat&lt;/a&gt; weekly for one big megawash. &lt;/p&gt;
