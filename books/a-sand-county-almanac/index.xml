      <description>We found the main stream to law that the teeter-snipe pattered about in what last year were trout riffles, and so warm that we could duck in its deepest pool without a shout. Even after our cooling swim, waders felt like hot tar paper in the sun. Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac. This 1989 Oxford Paperbacks edition, ISBN 0-19-505928-X, as an introductory essay from Robert Finch commemorating the 100th anniversary of Leopold&#39;s birth.</description>

      <description>This 1948 collection of essays about the changing of the seasons in Wisconsin was on my parents bookshelf, and sits on mine in the dining room where various bits of natural history live.
 There is an essay or three for each month.&amp;#0160; Here&amp;#39;s some part of November captured in words as &amp;quot;If I Were The Wind&amp;quot;
The wind that makes music in November corn is in a hurry.&amp;#0160; The stalks hum, the loose husks whisk skyward in half-playful whirls, and the wind hurries on.</description>
