oh, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I look like from the net (via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metromodemedia.com/features/SEMIBlogs0043.aspx&#34;&gt;metro mode media&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ed Vielmetti is Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s pied piper of Web 2.0 new urbanist geek culture and all round swell guy. A relentless networker and vital strand in the social and high tech spiderweb of A2 start ups and up starts, his blog is really more of a free-for-all of interesting links and informational tidbits. For short attention spans and expansive minds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The difficult part of this for me is the &amp;ldquo;short attention span&amp;rdquo;, because I feel like I have a long attention span (measured in years) though it might not have a long time in any particular day.  for instance:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
from my review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/05/crazybusy_overs.html&#34;&gt;Edward Hallowell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Crazy Busy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in 2006:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first half is a series of anecdotes about how the world has gone mad with fragmented attention spans, so that people have environmentally-induced ADD. The second half is self-help on coping with that world, and a few really neat exercises to improve your concentration.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
from an interview with &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/maira_kalman_il.html&#34;&gt;Maira Kalman in Library Journal&lt;/a&gt;: (2005)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Describe your thought process. For example, what inspired the image with the dog (&amp;ldquo;Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in&amp;rdquo;)?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;My very poor attention span allows me to jump from thing to thing with childish abandon. I chose the sentences only on the basis of what I liked. But once I narrowed down my choices, I wanted to be literal and true to the sentence. So, for instance, for the phrase &amp;ldquo;The temple of Isis&amp;rdquo; [see image, far left] I found images of the actual temple, which is on a small island on the Nile and rendered it with some characters sprinkled in. I tried to do this as often as possible. A reasoned madness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
my 1999 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epinions.com/book-review-1B5D-48B78F8-381676A3-bd3?linkin_id=8003929&#34;&gt;review of Blur on Epinions
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
This would be a great book to take out from the library and browse through hunting for ideas about the fast pace of modern life. If you have a short attention span you can even pick up a page, snag something quotable or at least interesting, and put it down again. But buy it to read it straight through&amp;hellip;can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it for that.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
and from a quote file:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Turnaucka&amp;rsquo;s Law: The attention span of a computer is only as long as its electrical cord.
&lt;/p&gt;
