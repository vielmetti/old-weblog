      <description>Eight of us met for lunch at Ayse&amp;rsquo;s today. It was a normal Thursday in that regard, as that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty typical size for the lunch group these days.
We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make sure that the things that needed to get done got done.</description>
