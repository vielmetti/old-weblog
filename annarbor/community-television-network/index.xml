      <description>&lt;p&gt;Answers to questions sent to Greg McDonald, CTN manager, regarding closed captioning at on City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Television Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you providing closed captioning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commission on Disability Issues made a request to add captions to their meetings to increase meeting accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is providing the closed captioning for CTN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScreenLine, L.L.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much is the size of the contract, and for how long does it run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not have a contract with the company, we’re in a trial period and they’ll be invoicing us each time we use their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are the individuals who are doing the closed captioning based? Are they on-site, or off-site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-site, based in Grand Ledge, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was the decision made to add closed captioning to the Disability Commission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Disability Commission request for closed caption services was approved as part of the FY2015 budget discussion at the Feb. 25, 2014 Cable Commission meeting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there considerations of adding closed captioning for City Council meetings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding would have to be identified in order for closed captioning services to be provided for City Council or other Board and Commission meetings cablecast by CTN.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has changed about the technology to make closed captioning feasible now when it wasn&#39;t before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology/equipment has improved and is a little less expensive today than when last researched in 2008. The closed caption service costs are about the same. The May 27, 2014 Cable Commission meeting includes (about 6:30 minute mark) discussion about the service and equipment  &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2govtv.pegcentral.com/player.php?video=507268f61855facce4fbff749ad0ad94&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the transcripts from the closed captioning available as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have no transcripts from the closed captions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last question: what does one hour of closed-captioned video cost, under your current arrangement with Screenline? Is there a list price, and did we get a discount? I listened to the Cable Commission discussion you linked to (thanks for that) but was no wiser as to the hourly rate from that discussion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is $100/hr and each meeting will require a minimum of 1hr of set-up/prep time but that could vary/increase depending upon the agenda.  As far as I know, we have not been given a discount, however ScreenLine has been very helpful as we were getting the technical part of the system set-up and did not charge us for any of their time during that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Watching a public meeting with five windows open to the world -</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor City Council holds meetings twice each month, which are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/communicationsoffice/ctn/meetingplace/Pages/TheMeetingPlace.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;streamed online through the city&amp;#39;s CTN network&lt;/a&gt;. I tuned in last night on my laptop to listen and watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;amp;src=typd&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;a2council&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience. The running cmmentary made it easier to follow what was going on, and it served as a back channel to help make sense of the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council was working from an agenda that&amp;#39;s in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2gov.legistar.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Legistar system&lt;/a&gt;, and from time to time I&amp;#39;d go back to that to see what the text of an agenda item was, to look at supporting materials, and see the detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor Chronicle does near-real-time news coverage as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchronicle.com/category/civic-news-ticker/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Civic News Ticker&lt;/a&gt;, reporting out results from key votes and decisions during the meeting. This is brief coverage but important, and it sets the stage for their 10,000 word meeting reports that come out a week or so later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had a window open to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Arborwiki&lt;/a&gt;, which has a local encyclopedia of information about what is going on in the city and the surrounding area. As council considered various options, I looked up what Arborwiki had to say about the current state of affairs, and updated it as best I could to reflect the meeting results and the news that was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that watching this multi-connected stream was different from the experience of being in the same room as council. You miss the non-verbal communications, the body language, the hallway conversations that take place during breaks, and all sorts of in-person nuance. But for what it was, I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with the experience. It felt like I was engaged with the meeting and could have a sense that I was part of the civic process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor City Council meetings now simulcast online</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-23-ann-arbor-city-council-meetings-now-simulcast-online/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/government/citycouncil/Pages/Home.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor City Council&lt;/a&gt; meetings are now simulcast online, which is handy if you don&amp;#39;t get local CTN cable service. &amp;#0160;This link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://a2docs.org/assets/files/2011/03/21/a2govtvcrawl.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;http://a2docs.org/assets/files/2011/03/21/a2govtvcrawl.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;goes to an experimental setup which also tracks the Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23aacitycouncil&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;#aacitycouncil&lt;/a&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/communicationsoffice/ctn/meetingplace/Pages/TheMeetingPlace.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;CTN Meetingplace&lt;/a&gt; page now hosts the current broadcast (both live and delayed) for CTN Channel 16. Meetings are held the first and third Monday nights of the month starting at 7:00 p.m., unless they aren&amp;#39;t for some reason like a holiday. There is a meeting today, May 23, 2011, which is a continuation of budget-related issues that were left unresolved at the May 16, 2011 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Legistar at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://a2gov.legistar.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;http://a2gov.legistar.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the calendar and agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Agendas can and do change up until the last moment, and it&amp;#39;s impossible to know ahead of time whether your topic of burning interest will be addressed at any given meeting. Watching online, and ensuring that you have a person who is tracking your issue close enough to city hall to get to council chambers, can be an alternative to sitting in the pews every other Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
