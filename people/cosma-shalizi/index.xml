      <description>Since 1994, Cosma Shalizi has been keeping track of what he is reading and what he is interested in in his notebooks online.
 Burned all my notebooks What good are notebooks If they won&#39;t help me survive?  The colophon is worth quoting in full, though you&#39;ll need to go to the original to get all of the hyperlinks.
 These notebooks began in September 1994 as a set of key-words for Usenet filtering; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember why I started to elaborate them, but I did, and put them online on 3 October 1994.</description>
