      <description>The question &amp;ldquo;What is it that you do&amp;rdquo; is a peculiarly Midwestern one, which admits most easily as an answer &amp;ldquo;I work in the mines&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I work at Fords&amp;rdquo;. Much more interesting is the expected response to the California version of the query, which lets you talk about the places that you used to work so that you can put together a story that matches not only what you&amp;rsquo;re doing now but also selective bits and pieces of a work history to back it up.</description>

      <description>If you are working on a project in Github, your work isn&amp;rsquo;t always linear. Sometimes the change you make doesn&amp;rsquo;t work completely, so you back a little bit of it out and move forward on a next part. It may take some hacking and sawing (and testing of course) to get a change that just works right.
Projects like to have contributions, but project maintainers don&amp;rsquo;t like to insert noise into their efforts.</description>

      <description>Joyent has released Manta, a computing environment that includes a powerful map/reduce system which leverages native Unix commands. Unlike a Hadoop world where you have to spin up a Java environment to get anything done, Manta makes map/reduce as simple as possible for those of us who know the Unix shell pretty well.
Some examples may be useful.
for n in $HOME/doc/books/* do wc -l $n &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $TMP/wc-tmp done awk &amp;#39;{ t += $1 } END { print t }&amp;#39; &amp;lt; $TMP/wc-tmp  has an equivalent in Manta as something like</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I love Twitter - I love being in the flow of the world with the off hand comments of hundreds of friends around the world triggering all sorts of warm feelings and thoughts about how lucky I am to know so many people in so many places.
For that very same reason, I&amp;#39;m working towards getting off Twitter, my &amp;quot;twitter zero&amp;quot; project, where I unfollow everyone I&amp;#39;ve been following.</description>
