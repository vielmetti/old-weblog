      <description>Every month the Washtenaw County Health Department releases reports from a previous month&amp;rsquo;s inspections of restaurants in the county. Restaurants are typically inspected twice a year. The inspector looks to see that the state Food Code is enforced, with a particular eye towards identifying violations that result in increased risk to the public of food-borne illness.
Wayne Eaker has put together a searchable and browsable database of these inspections, which is online at food-inspections.</description>

Wayne Eaker built an importer that pulls in data from the site that hosts the official county inspections, and is storing the inspection data on Github to make it easier for the next person who wants to build a nice interface to all the data.
Wayne was good enough to find a spot to host an interface to this data that lets you browse through it; you can find it at</description>
