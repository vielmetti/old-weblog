      <description>&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the word &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/05/23/fifth-washington-9/&#34;&gt;from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/may-2013-peony-bloom-countdown-the-peony-garden-nichols-arboretum-ann-arbor.html&#34;&gt;the peonies start&lt;/a&gt; but before &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/strawberry-season-is-coming-for-2013-some-first-harvest-estimates.html&#34;&gt;the u-pick strawberries are ready&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Neurodiversity and the advantages of autism-spectrum disorders in network building</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2011/2011-06-20-neurodiversity/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&amp;#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&amp;#39;s, ALS, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;diversity&lt;/span&gt; of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parallel set of diversity-seeking looks to build connections with people who have diverse ways of perceiving the world. The &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffbfff;&#34;&gt;neurotypical&lt;/span&gt; view of the world is best balanced with views from people who don&amp;#39;t have nervous systems and sensory systems that perceive the world or act on those perceptions in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffdf;&#34;&gt;Neurodiversity&lt;/span&gt; is a word with some specific meaning within a community of people with autism-spectrum disorders, a community which I know only at the edges and can&amp;#39;t count myself a core part of. In some ways I can only hope to approximate that perspective, e.g. in the occasional bits of &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #dfbfff;&#34;&gt;assisted synesthesia&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#0160;that I try to sneak into my writing. If you are living in a neurotypical world, the insight from someone with diverse sensory perception can trigger the &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #dfbfff;&#34;&gt;great weird ideas&lt;/span&gt; that you find when worlds that were once foreign to each other gain a bridge that helps pull good thoughts from one side to the other. Or, perhaps, I&amp;#39;m a&amp;#0160;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #e6ebd5;&#34;&gt;neurodiverse&lt;/span&gt; individual in this collection, and you are neurotypical by comparison; it&amp;#39;s so hard to tell sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://holisticwisdom.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Linda Diane Feldt&lt;/a&gt; for the idea, and credit goes to Patricia Anderson for the source for the quote, attributed to the &amp;quot;Autism Liberation Front&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
