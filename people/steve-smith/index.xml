      <description>&lt;p&gt;January 8, 2016, 5:30 pm (Ann Arbor time): Central Michigan University
spokesman Steve Smith answered questions today by telephone regarding
a Morning Sun editorial, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.themorningsun.com/opinion/20160108/editorial-status-quo-cmu-mum-on-talk-of-shutting-tv-station&#34;&gt;Status quo: CMU mum on talk of shutting TV station&lt;/a&gt;, published in this Digital First Media newspaper
from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lede, the newspaper writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Central Michigan University considers whether or not to shut
down its Public Broadcasting television network, the silence is
deafening.  CMU trustees almost a month ago voted to consider
shutting WCMU-TV and its three sister stations in exchange for up
to $726 million from the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith poined out that the University had only approved to &amp;ldquo;apply
for eligibility&amp;rdquo;, which is not binding on CMU to proceed, and that
all options were open. In addition, he noted a Federal anti-collusion
rule that restricts the rights of potential auction participants
to speak freely about their intent leading up to the auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Michigan University invites public comment on its decisions
to sell part or all of its broadcast spectrum back to the FCC, in an
auction that is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. Address your
comments in email to trustees@cmich.edu or by postal mail to
106 Warriner Hall, Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant, MI 48859.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cmich.edu/bot/Pages/default.aspx&#34;&gt;The next public meeting of the Trustees is on February 18, 2016&lt;/a&gt;,
and with prior arrangement there is time for the public to provide
comment on agenda items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission, which
manages this auction, was not available for comment at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference see the following FCC documents:&lt;/p&gt;
