      <description>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away. I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).
The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch a postcard from the command line of my Mac.</description>

      <description>A bus labeled &amp;ldquo;TRAINING&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t take that one.
Kayakers in bright yellow kayaks on the Huron River under the bridge on Fuller Road.
Would it be too much to ask to have wifi actually on the blue bus, or is it more reasonable to expect that people have cell data coverage everywhere and that wifi on the bus is for long haul buses like Megabus?
I&amp;rsquo;m happy that with Hugo I can have a reasonably complete local blogging environment completely independent of having Internet access, so long as I have my computer with me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve updated my email vacation message to inform my correspondents that I&amp;#39;m taking the weekend off from electronic mail. If you get some message to that effect, you know how to get ahold of me.
I envy those with enough status to completely exit electronic mail, but at the very least I expect that an occasional weekend could be email-free.
Some background:
Paul Jones has given up on email, in his #noemail project.</description>
