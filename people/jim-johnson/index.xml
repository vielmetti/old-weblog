      <description>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota. From a profile of Jim Johnson by writer Cheryl Reitan in the mnartists.org site:
 JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.</description>
