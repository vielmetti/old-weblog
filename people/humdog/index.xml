      <description>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.
The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism&amp;#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.
 Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network.</description>
