      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m intrigued of late by the notion of &#34;small wins&#34;. This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker&#39;s book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you&#39;re really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn&#39;t register yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A small win is a concrete, complete outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of small wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals. A series of small wins is also more structurally sound than a large win because small wins are stable building blocks. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. When a solution is put into place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible. Additional resources flow toward winners, which means that slightly larger wins can be attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, rather than think about how hard it would be to produce a book of 80,000 words all in one sitting, it gets a lot easier to think how easy it would be to produce 400 words per day (on a topic of your choice naturally) for 200 days over the course of a year. I can bat out 100 words without thinking about it to answer an email message a dozen times a day. So capturing 80,000 words is simply a matter of doing that in some sensible order and not getting sidetracked by the need for everything to make 100% sense at the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve seen lots of electoral maps, with the US colored various shades of red, blue, or purple.  The simplest ones just colorize the map; the most complex distort the map and refine the color space to show various aspects of the population, its voting patterns and changes over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kottke.org/plus/2008-election-maps/&#34;&gt;Jason Kottke has a good collection of 2008 election maps from all over the world,&lt;/a&gt; showing mostly the state of real time map software by newspapers, web sites, and television updated during the vote count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.readthespirit.com/ourvalues/2008/11/as-we-await-res.html&#34;&gt;Wayne Baker asks on his Our Values blog:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;webkit-indent-blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;webkit-indent-blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #333333; font-family: arial; line-height: normal; &#34;&gt;Take a moment, perhaps as you&#39;re watching election returns, to tell me what you think of our country right now. Think about this question: What color is America today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/&#34;&gt;Mark Newman has a collection of 2008 election cartograms&lt;/a&gt; that selectively distort the map to show how the electoral college and county by county variety in political preferences paint a distinctive landscape:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/&#34;&gt;&lt;img  alt=&#34;Mark Newman&#39;s election 2008 cartogram&#34; class=&#34; selected&#34; src=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countycartnonlin1024.png&#34; title=&#34;Mark Newman&#39;s election 2008 cartogram&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/faq.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.npr.org/news/specials/votereport/map.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/whistling-past-bubba.html&lt;/p&gt;
