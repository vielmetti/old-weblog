      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued of late by the notion of small wins. This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker&amp;rsquo;s book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you&amp;rsquo;re really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn&amp;rsquo;t register yet.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve seen lots of electoral maps, with the US colored various shades of red, blue, or purple. The simplest ones just colorize the map; the most complex distort the map and refine the color space to show various aspects of the population, its voting patterns and changes over time. Jason Kottke has a good collection of 2008 election maps from all over the world, showing mostly the state of real time map software by newspapers, web sites, and television updated during the vote count.</description>
