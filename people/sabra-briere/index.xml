      <description>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when voter turnout is very low.
I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on, or the perpetually politically curious.</description>

      <description>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the &#34;Paid for by&#34; language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.
I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook.</description>
