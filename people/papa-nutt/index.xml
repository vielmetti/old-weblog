      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest in cryptocurrencies is the Juggalocoin, proposed to handle the transactional needs of the fans of the Insane Clown Posse. From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6049084/meet-the-insane-coin-posse-juggalos-get-their-own&#34;&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt; (because after all this is an entertainment story):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoop whoop! A very tech-savvy Juggalo by the name of Papa Nutt has taken it upon himself to create a cryptocurrency specifically for Faygo-chugging devotees of &#34;the Family&#34; to buy goods and services with*, especially at the upcoming Gathering of the Juggalos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the acid test of any coin: can you buy Faygo with it? From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/09/juggalocoins_the_cryptocurrency_for_insane_clown_posse_fans.html&#34;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems quite possible this is all a good joke, but given the purchasing power of the Juggaloes, the Faygo company might want to update its payment system just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=568484.0&#34;&gt;Bitcointalk&lt;/a&gt;, someone who calls themself &#34;Juggalocoin&#34; launches into a spirited defense of the currency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To reach the huge non-crypto masses requires something they can identify with.  Dogecoin did it.  Kinda.  In a weird, fleeting way.  Doge is just a glimpse of what&#39;s possible.  But memes have a VERY limited lifespan.  Doge may grow beyond the meme.  I don&#39;t know.  But with Juggalos, it&#39;s not about a meme.  It&#39;s about a community.  A community that already exists, and has been around for over 20 years!  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This is the innovation that JuggaloCoin offers:  A coin that appeals to a very specific, very tight community.  A community of over 1 million people.  We are offering a real opportunity for crypto to dramatically increase its reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
