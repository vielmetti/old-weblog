      <description>I&amp;#39;m working on a book on the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, which is just about half done. You can see a copy on LeanPub at http://leanpub.com/michigan-foia . There are some sample chapters to download for free, or you can get the whole thing in its current draft state for a price that you choose. It&amp;#39;s as good a time as any to let people know about it, since this week is Sunshine Week 2013.</description>
