      <description>Your comments excluded, of course, dear reader, though there are more posts here than comments by people on those posts. The reference is to the interminable slog of newspaper comments which place a long stream of dreck at the end of that carefully edited story.
I miss the days of carefully considered letters to the editor - when you could count on not every letter getting published, when you were limited to a certain number of words, and when if you were wildly off-topic your words might never see the light of day.</description>
