      <description>WNYC has put together the Dark and Stormy mix tape, featuring Lena Horne&amp;#39;s Stormy Weather and Prince&amp;#39;s Purple Rain on side A, and Nanci Griffith&amp;#39;s cover of Wasn&amp;#39;t That a Mighty Storm on side B.&amp;#0160;
Galveston had a seawall&amp;#0160;
To keep the water down,&amp;#0160;
But the high tide from the ocean&amp;#0160;
Washed water over the town.&amp;#0160;
The New Yorker has&amp;#0160;The iPod of the Hurricane, songs for a windy weekend, leading with&amp;#0160;Wynonie Harris, “She’s Gone with the Wind”.</description>

      <description>as seen in this excellent NY Daily News article -
Galveston had a seawall To keep the water down, But the high tide from the ocean Washed water over the town. Wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm! Oh, wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm with water!
Wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm That blew all the people away! Their trumpets gave them warning, &amp;quot;You&#39;d better leave this place.&amp;quot; They never thought of leaving Till death looked them in the face.</description>
