      <title>2015 Skywarn training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After three or four years of planning to get Skywarn training, this year I finally did it. The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was there with John Hritz KD8MKE and Ann Hanson. Ann captured the opening slide. There was a nifty online multiplayer game (can&#39;t recall the site it was built on) which had 95 people playing along from their smart phones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spotter ID good for 2 years is 242.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought my radio to the event and made a contact from the car with Marty KD8RGL from Canton MI. We were both using 5 watt radios contacting the W8UM repeater in Ann Arbor - I&#39;m always surprised how well things work when they do work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered that it works a lot better to identify myself as &#34;Eddie&#34; when on the air. This because &#34;Ed&#34; gets misinterpreted as &#34;Andy&#34; all too often, and &#34;Edward&#34; seems awfully formal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arborbike, a first review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d12974a7970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d12974a7970c img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;arborbike&#34; title=&#34;IMG_0636&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d12974a7970c-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus: fun to ride, big front basket. It&#39;s a very nice bike that you&#39;re riding, with a good 3 speed shifter and a very sturdy construction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minus: no lights, no bell, no helmets. More specifically, I am told that the lights come on automatically, and that there is a bell somewhere, but I didn&#39;t find it and it wasn&#39;t labelled. I did have a helmet with me so I wore that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborbike.org/&#34;&gt;arborbike.org&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kanban; or, management by post-it note</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-28-kanban-or-manag/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I wrote a few years back about a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhritz/6225044/&#34;&gt;mini-kanban that John Hritz had put together to remember to refill washer fluid&lt;/a&gt;.  There are a lot of colorful sticky notes around my workplace these days, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d read up on how kanban-inspired systems are being used for process management in the software development and other non-manufacturing worlds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some inspiring examples (with post-its to illustrate):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Corey Ladis on &lt;a href=&#34;http://leansoftwareengineering.com/2007/08/29/kanban-systems-for-software-development/&#34;&gt;Kanban systems for software engineering:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
A perfect state of flow may be very difficult, or at least uneconomical, to achieve in a robust product development process. But we can get pretty close with a well-tuned kanban pull system. We have managed to combine most of the flexibility of craft production with most of the control of a pipeline. Work-in-process is limited, and cycle time can be managed. Most importantly, it is a highly transparent and repeatable process with all of the right conditions for continuous improvement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
oh, wait a second, this is starting to be spooky: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2008/02/modus-cooperand.html&#34;&gt;Jim Benson&amp;rsquo;s notes on the new people at his Modus Cooperandi:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Corey Ladas - Corey has been a proponent of iterative and evolutionary design methods since the early 1990â€™s, and was an early practitioner and vocal promoter of Agile methods at Microsoft. Corey began collaborating with David Anderson at Microsoft in 2004, united by a common interest in the application of Lean, Theory of Constraints, and Statistical Process Control methods to software development. In 2007, Corey joined David at Corbis to implement kanban systems for the development of enterprise IT projects.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Time to talk to Jim&amp;hellip;
&lt;/p&gt;
