      <description>Espresso over ice at ERC South Main. This is now my favorite summer drink. Served in a cup with enough ice and you get the makings of a very strong iced latte, just add a little half and half.
The work of the morning is finishing up yesterday&amp;rsquo;s work on sending postcards with Lob.com. Key to this effort is resizing your favorite images so that they meet the template. Fortunately I had the presence of mind seven years ago to write up my notes on using sips and Imagemagick for image manipulation and that helped.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m looking forward to reading&amp;#0160;Adam Grant&amp;#39;s book&amp;#0160;Give and Take&amp;#0160;(aadl). &amp;#0160;Look in the March 31 NY Times Magazine for a preview, featuring a quote from the U of Michigan&amp;#39;s Jerry Davis. At the moment I&amp;#39;m&amp;#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&amp;#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!
The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:
 Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.</description>

      <description>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them.

Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network.
It&#39;s OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts.</description>
