      <description>The Detroit Sound Conservancy went to the vacant Book Building in Detroit on July 7, 2015 to salvage the collection of the defunct Graystone International Jazz Museum. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice writeup in MLive, Graystone jazz artifacts, forgotten in Detroit skyscraper, now being preserved. Photographer Doug Coombe went along to document the effort with a photo set on Facebook.
 &amp;ldquo;We knew that things were bad,&amp;rdquo; said DSC&amp;rsquo;s Founder and President Carleton Gholz about the neglected collection, but Gholz didn&amp;rsquo;t know how bad until he discovered many of the former museum&amp;rsquo;s records were broken and strewn across the floor.</description>
