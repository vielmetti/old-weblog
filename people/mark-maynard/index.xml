      <description>I&amp;#39;m planning to go to Beer with Bloggers, a get-together organized by Mark Maynard.
 An event for Michigan bloggers of all stripes, and the people who love them... No formal agenda. Just lots of talking over beer about blogs, politics, food, culture and the state of independent media.
 Hope to see you there!</description>

The city of Ypsilanti will restore the historic Ypsilanti Freighthouse located in Depot Town. The project will include major structural improvements to the foundation, floor, walls, pilasters, roof and interior mechanical systems. These items, outlined in a Conditional Assessment Report, are required to re-open the 1878 facility, which is planned to serve as a community center, farmers market, café and education center.</description>

      <description>Mark Maynard, Ypsilanti, November 2008: Cafe Luwak
This month, the MM.com special can be found at&amp;#0160;Cafe Luwak, where, if you buy one sandwich, you’ll get one free… And the same goes for those urban elitist coffee drinks known as lattes… Seriously, how better to celebrate an Obama win in Michigan than with the official drink of the liberal elite?
 Todd Waller, Team366, morgan and york, $5 off on $50 w/coupon (PDF)).</description>
