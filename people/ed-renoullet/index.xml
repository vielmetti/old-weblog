      <description>Cafe Ambrosia is located on Maynard Street in Ann Arbor, across the street from the Nickels Arcade and adjacent to the Maynard Street parking structure. A cup of coffee is $0.95 with your go!pass discount. Ed Renoullet runs the cafe. This photograph captures the morning sunlight that reaches the cafe&amp;#39;s front window on a late March morning in Ann Arbor.
Ambrosia is distinctive for having one of the best events bulletin boards in town (another story), for having power outlets at every table, and for its relatively new front seating arrangement.</description>
