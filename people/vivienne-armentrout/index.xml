      <description>I&#39;ve unsubscribed from a local politics mailing list that I&#39;ve been on for a while. Out of an abundance of not wanting to name names, I&#39;m not naming names; chances are there&#39;s one of these in your community too.
The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There&#39;s a list owner, who sets the rules. One of the rules is that the list is a private list, with no reporters on it and no one is supposed to share anything they get from the list to anyone who&#39;s not on the list.</description>
