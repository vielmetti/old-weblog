      <description>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the &#34;Paid for by&#34; language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.
I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook.</description>

      <description>From email sent by Ann Arbor City Council member Christopher Taylor (D-3d Ward).
 Friends,
Here is a quick update for you about the snow and the City’s response.
As of 9:00 pm, we have had 11+ inches of snow. We have not declared a formal snow emergency and street parking is unrestricted. All City facilities will be open Monday and trash collection will run on its ordinary schedule. Road crews are out working 12 – 14 hour shifts.</description>
