      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The house was quiet and the world was calm.&lt;br /&gt;The reader became the book; and summer night&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Was like the conscious being of the book. &lt;br /&gt;The house was quiet and the world was calm.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The words were spoken as if there was no book,&lt;br /&gt;Except that the reader leaned above the page,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be&lt;br /&gt;The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The summer night is like a perfection of thought.&lt;br /&gt;The house was quiet because it had to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind:&lt;br /&gt;The access of perfection to the page.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world, &lt;br /&gt;In which there is no other meaning, itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself&lt;br /&gt;Is the reader leaning late and reading there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;— Wallace Stevens&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, along the way, I also found this &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty.goucher.edu/eng215/concordances_and_author_horizon.htm&#34;&gt;Concordances and the Authors&#39; Horizon of Words&#39; Meaning&lt;/a&gt;, a way to start looking at how poets use words through tools that include &#34;keyword in context&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
