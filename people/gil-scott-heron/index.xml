Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson.  Written after Scott-Heron had recorded &#34;I&#39;m New Here&#34; but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around the middle seventies when I first heard this brazen, young black man&#39;s voice. He was angry! We were angry! I was angry! Angry over the fact that it was a few years ago that they had just taken from us our black shining Prince. He was mad. We were mad. I was mad! Mad over the fact that our struggle for freedom had come to a screeching halt. He was loud! Loud and determined to be heard. And I heard him. I heard him loud and clear. I heard him when he said &#34;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&#34;. I heard him when he said &#34;No Knock On My Brothers&#39; Head&#34;. I heard him when he was saying that the spirit of Brother Malcolm will flourish in him as it has in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gilscottheron.net/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;GilScottHeron.net &lt;/a&gt;- official site - includes his song &lt;a href=&#34;http://gilscottheron.net/album&#34;&gt;&#34;I&#39;m New Here&#34;&lt;/a&gt; from his album of the same name on XL Recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Searches on Google under “news” are not showing any pages at five past three. It’s Gil Scott-Heron. You really do want to be sure before you write this up as a news source. No matter who crows about who was first on the web to break a story, trust is the currency. Trust and accuracy so, I am not surprised that the mainstream houses are not publishing yet. (No offence intended for the original tweet)
