      <description>A Death Cafe is a safe place where people get together to talk about death and have tea and delicious cake. The idea originated in Switzerland as the &amp;quot;cafe mortel&amp;quot;, is organized from the UK, and has spread to France, Australia and the US. Events are low key, held in public places, and are safe and informal.&amp;#0160;
The Ann Arbor Death Cafe is the first of these events to be held in Michigan.</description>
