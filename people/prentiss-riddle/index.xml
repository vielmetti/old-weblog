      <description>&lt;p&gt;Espresso over ice at ERC South Main. This is now my favorite summer drink.
Served in a cup with enough ice and you get the makings of a very strong
iced latte, just add a little half and half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the morning is finishing up yesterday&amp;rsquo;s work on sending
postcards with Lob.com. Key to this effort is resizing your favorite
images so that they meet the template. Fortunately I had the presence
of mind seven years ago to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-29-image-processing-on-the-mac-with-sips-imagemagick-watching-dte-restore-power-slowly/&#34;&gt;write up my notes on using sips and Imagemagick&lt;/a&gt;
for image manipulation and that helped. In this case the magic incantation
was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sips -z 1275 1875 original.jpg --out new.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Mac, or want to do this on a server or container
somewhere, you&amp;rsquo;ll want Imagemagick. That venerable program has a
bazillion options, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find the image geometry options at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry&#34;&gt;http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry&lt;/a&gt; .
Recreating this exact sips command is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bit of image processing taken care of, the next iteration is to
launch a few actual postcards into the ether. After having confirmed
that everything goes OK on the test key, I sent out four cards. Estimated
delivery date is July 30, so I&amp;rsquo;m expecting about a two week turnaround
for feedback that I got everything right. Lob has card tracking so I guess
the next step is to write the simple tools to know when things were
delivered so that I can plan some phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr  /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin Zorba has perhaps the best bio in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has, in the course of his endeavors: been shot at by Navajos
in Utah; seized and threatened at knifepoint by rednecks in Arkansas;
chased by AK-47-toting soldiers in Hungary; run out of town by the
Penitentes in Truchas; shaken down by the Federales in Baja, and
forced to be rude to secure a cab in Rome. He has hung out of and
over: planes, balloons, helicopters, boats, rafts, race cars,
elevator shafts, too tall cliffs, and real deep canyons- and yet,
he still has enthusiasm and a good attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerry Davis asks why we still have academic journals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web has greatly reduced the barriers to entry for new journals
and other platforms for communicating scientific output, and the
number of journals continues to multiply. This leaves readers and
authors with the daunting cognitive challenge of navigating the
literature and discerning contributions that are both relevant and
significant. Meanwhile, measures of journal impact that might guide
the use of the literature have become more visible and consequential,
leading to “impact gamesmanship” that renders the measures increasingly
suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essay, published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://asq.sagepub.com/content/59/2/193&#34;&gt;Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/a&gt; in June 2014, has the seeds of its own answer. Journals
exist to enrich academic publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay per Article - You may purchase this article for US$32.00. You
must download your purchase, which is yours to keep, within 24
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just ask Jerry for a preprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously (1995!) I get quoted in the Times Higher Education Supplement.
The debate then centered around Stevan Harnad, an open access journal
advocate who saw clearly the trend towards low cost electronic publications,
thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains only to tally up these PostGutenberg values: If the
world&amp;rsquo;s esoteric scholarly/scientific literature were available to
everyone for free in electronic form, the first benefit to the
author would be the great increase in the visibility, accessibility
and hence the potential impact of his work (1). This would of course
also be a benefit to all scholars when they are wearing their
readers&amp;rsquo; rather than their authors&amp;rsquo; hats (2). Some fear that such
a literature would be overwhelming and un-navigable, but stop and
think: How do we currently manage it in paper? If the entire corpus
were transferred to the Net, instead of our eyes and fingers and
feet doing the walking to get to the papers or to get the papers
to us, electronic directories containing everything could be searched
using the kinds of keyword search already used today in searching
electronic databases that contain the titles and abstracts (but not
the articles) in the paper literature. Then, one more click, and
you have the paper itself! Or clever &amp;ldquo;knowbots&amp;rdquo; (automatic search
programmes) could be designed to go out instead of us and look for
papers fitting our profile of interests, leaving us even more time
to actually read what we want and to do our research, rather than
running after the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My reply, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/harnad-versus-fuller-round-2/98502.article&#34;&gt;immortalized from the past&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Vielmetti (bottom) uncontroversially points out that there
is a lot of rubbish on the Internet; but he is sceptical of peer
review as a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original commentary is lost in the mists of time, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two institutions that went by the name of GopherCon.
(No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a furry convention; that&amp;rsquo;s Anthrocon.) One was
from the early 1990s surrounding the Gopher internet browsing
protocol; the other is for enthusiasts and programmers of the
Go programming language. I am not aware of anyone who can claim
to have gone to both events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.databaseteam.org/10-database/0722cf77b51ab4ba.htm&#34;&gt;GopherCon 1995&lt;/a&gt;
featured discussion of GopherVR and VRML for virtual reality in Gopher,
the Hyper-G Information System for hypertext authoring, and an
early morning session on Integrating Gopher and WWW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GopherCon 2015 was in early July in Colorado. Of the items on
the agenda this talk by Barak Michener was perhaps the most interesting
to follow through on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in Go, Cayley is a graph database based on technology
behind Freebase.com. Starting with a short history of the inspirations
behind Cayley, this talk will deep-dive into the moving parts of
building a graph database, between the various query languages, the
storage engines, and the iterator trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this blog is now powered by Hugo which is written in Go
so I&amp;rsquo;m learning a little about the Go template language as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to write for multiple social media channels at once</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-12-how-to-write-for-multiple-social-media-channels-at-once/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 19:49:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-12-how-to-write-for-multiple-social-media-channels-at-once/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion, from long-time blogger &lt;a href=&#34;http://prentissriddle.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Prentiss Riddle&lt;/a&gt;, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks. You can then push out whatever you want to write wherever and whenever you desire, and still own the original content in a place that you can control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-manning/2/b58/469&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Bill Manning&lt;/a&gt; suggests &lt;a href=&#34;http://streamified.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Streamified&lt;/a&gt;, which is an aggregator that pulls together a variety of inbound streams and presents them attractively. &amp;quot;Add all of your&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://streamified.com/#social_streams&#34;&gt;social streams&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and watch them all come together in one place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://about.me/ryanburns&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ryan Burns&lt;/a&gt; suggests &lt;a href=&#34;http://bufferapp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; (bufferapp), which lets you write once and then push out those posts to multiple places. &amp;quot;Easily add great articles, pictures and videos to your Buffer and we automagically share them for you through the day!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/juliewbee&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Julie Weatherbee&lt;/a&gt; notes (quite correctly) that simply replicating the same text in Twitter and Facebook is folly, because it doesn&amp;#39;t play to the strengths of either medium. Twitter&amp;#39;s @ references and # hashtags look foolish in a Facebook status, and if you have someone following you on both systems, they&amp;#39;ll find the duplicate efforts irritating. Twitter&amp;#39;s rapid fire, real time updates can overwhelm a Facebook feed easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real challenge, though, is in designing for the writing style. The enforced 140 character limit of Twitter forces you to be pithy, but it also gets in the way of writing coherent sentences and paragraphs. Perhaps, as I have tried to do here, I can repurpose the original Twitter posting and use it as the lead paragraph of a longer essay that lives on Typepad and is excerpted for a Facebook post. As a writing design that&amp;#39;s a hard constraint, but as usual, the discipline of constraints lends itself to better writing if you can pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How twitter and gopher were born, (or) why you should make it work on the worst system first</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this post on &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/&#34;&gt;how twitter was born&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is making the rounds; thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/pzriddle&#34;&gt;Prentiss Riddle&lt;/a&gt; for alerting me to it.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; The best quote from it is the use case that involves the worst possible internet device in the world: text messages from a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;I remember that @Jack’s first use case was city-related: telling people that the club he’s at is &lt;em&gt;happening&lt;/em&gt;.
“I want to have a dispatch service that connects us on our phones using
text.” His idea was to make it so simple that you don’t even think
about what you’re doing, you just type something and send it. Typing
something on your phone in those days meant you were probably messing
with T9 text input, unless you were sporting a relatively rare
smartphone. Even so, everyone in our group got the idea instantly and
wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a point of comparison, here&amp;#39;s&lt;a href=&#34;http://yourtech.typepad.com/main/2007/04/from_the_archiv.html&#34;&gt; part of the origin story for Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, the early 1990s internet system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Full-text searching was like a new thing under the sun five years ago,&amp;quot; notes McCahill.&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;The
two, with assistance from the newly formed Gopher Team, fine-tuned the
prototype as music from Nirvana and Mudhoney blared in the background. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;It
was a fun time,&amp;quot; recalls team member Torrey. &amp;quot;It was a lot of late
nights and weekends and a lot of beer, pizza and speed metal.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Eventually, the team needed some files to dump into their baby Gopher so they could demonstrate its text-searching capability.&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;We
took the Usenet (the Internet&amp;#39;s newsgroup system) cookbook and put that
into it,&amp;quot; says McCahill. &amp;quot;That was the first thing - so first the
Gopher was serving recipes up. We figured everybody ate, and it was a
good way of illustrating what full-text searching could do.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;If
you were looking for recipes with eggplant, you simply typed in the
word and the application would locate every eggplant reference - a
dazzling capability in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nothing quite like having a real use for the system you build while building it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nathan Schneider defends the memory theater</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-12-nathan-schneider-defends-the-memory-theater/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2010 12:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-12-nathan-schneider-defends-the-memory-theater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An essay published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/in-defense-of-the-memory-theater/&#34;&gt;Open Letters Monthly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;I fear for our memory theaters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any essay of lamentation about the end of books and the glory of human memory has to include some touchstones.  Frances Yates is that touchstone here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the books that I used to habitually pick up from my college library, and which, recently, I finally bought used, is &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Frances Yates&lt;/span&gt;’s classic &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffdfbf;&#34;&gt;The Art of Memory&lt;/span&gt;. First published in 1966, it chronicles lost mnemonic techniques, passed down from the ancient orators to the Renaissance humanists: spaces people would conjure in their minds to help them remember all the precious accoutrements of civilized knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Art of Memory&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;The Art of Memory&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the pleasures of writing incessantly online is the likelihood that you&amp;#39;ve run across something before, even if you don&amp;#39;t have it in the top of memory.  Prentiss Riddle wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://aprendizdetodo.com/time/?item=20030331&#34;&gt;The Art of Memory&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, apparently because I mentioned it on a mailing list, saying this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Frances Yates], [The Art of Memory] -- just getting started on this one, which is an account of the history of mnemotechnics: the art and practice of expanding and augmenting the human memory. The classical account of this goes back to &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfdfff;&#34;&gt;Simonides of Ceos&lt;/span&gt;, who had memorized all of the names and seating arrangements of the attendees at a banquet while giving a speech to them and was thus able to identify the dead when the banquet hall collapsed. Ancient orators used these memory systems to memorize long, long speeches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, armed with a new word &amp;quot;mnemotechnic&amp;quot;, I can go through and pluck out this precious specimen from Google Books; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=ImcPAAAAYAAJ&#34;&gt;Phreno-mnemotechnic dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, a work from 1844 by &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfdfff;&#34;&gt;Francis Fauvel-Gourand&lt;/span&gt; with a preface that illustrates the noted figures in the history of those who have an exceptional memory. The bulk of the work is a dictionary compiled along the principles of &amp;quot;soundex&amp;quot;, where words with similar consonant structure are indexed together and given a number.  Thus you will find on page 62 the entry for 382 (&amp;quot;homophony&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;muffin&amp;quot;); to make this make sense, you need to get a mapping between the &amp;quot;m&amp;quot; sound and the number 3, &amp;quot;f&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ph&amp;quot; and 8, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; and 2, and then encode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could there be any practical use for this?  Certainly; this is a &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffbfff;&#34;&gt;learned synesthesia&lt;/span&gt;, where numbers turn into words.  If you ever have had to memorize a license plate number (I am looking at one where the partial plate is &amp;quot;6981&amp;quot;) you know it&amp;#39;s hard.  But knowing that 69 maps to &amp;quot;sheep&amp;quot; and 81 maps to &amp;quot;fat&amp;quot; means that this vehicle can be memorialized as &amp;quot;sheepfat&amp;quot;, which is wonderful in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ddebe2;&#34;&gt;Now where was I?  Distracted, I guess&lt;/span&gt;.  Like Nathan Schneider, my memories are indexed in part through the books I have been reading.  The bookshelf that he evokes, carefully collected, is the memory construct that says that when you pull in one book you want to be able to leaf through the one next to it on the bookshelf, or the whole shelf full of them assembled for a purpose.  You judge the quality of a story told through books by the quality and comprehensiveness of the books invoked to tell it, and you look for the bibliography eagerly for texts you have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bookshelves are too small to hold all the books that might sit on them, but sometimes there have been ways to make up for that.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/3177427/&#34;&gt;photo of the bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; provides some substitute to prove not only that you have had the books but also that you know that some go together with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the book&amp;#0160;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226950018/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=superpatron-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226950018&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The Art of Memory&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0226950018&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

 Since it&amp;#39;s game day (Michigan at Minnesota) I thought I&amp;#39;d link to at least a few connections between Michigan and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;#0160; The Little Brown Jug is the trophy that goes back and forth between the two schools depending on which one wins the game.&amp;#0160; It was originally purchased as a water jug for the Michigan team on an away game to Minnesota in 1903, it was left behind after the game (a 6-6 tie).&amp;#0160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedailygopher.com/2008/11/6/655570/the-little-brown-jug&#34;&gt;The Daily Gopher has an excellent roundup of the story (warning: Minnesota point of view) quoting from several Michigan football blogs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Days later when Yost sent a letter requesting his water jug back, Cook replied saying &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;We have your little brown jug; if you want it, you’ll have to win it.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Little_Brown_Jug&#34;&gt;Little Brown Jug&lt;/a&gt;, and on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Brown_Jug&#34;&gt;Brown Jug&lt;/a&gt; (a South University campus bar and restaurant) at Arborwiki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;#0160; Michigan shares a border with Minnesota along Lake Superior, and there is public transportation by ferry from Houghton, Michigan to Grand Portage, Minnesota via a stop at the Isle Royale National Park.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isleroyaleboats.com/&#34;&gt;Minnesota to Isle Royale ferry information:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Grand Portage Isle Royale Transportation Line began as a way for the
    Sivertson family of Lake Superior&amp;#39;s north shore to transport their catch of
    freshwater fish from Isle Royale to Minnesota. It gradually expanded to include
    passenger service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/isro&#34;&gt;Michigan to Isle Royale ferry information:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Unlike other Isle Royale ferry services, the Ranger III was designed by
the National Park Service specifically to bridge the gap between the
mainland and the Island. It was built to withstand the Lake’s fierce
storms and its ice breaking capabilities assist in opening the park in
the spring. An experienced nine-member crew take great pride in not
only maintaining the vessel, but in serving its passengers. The Ranger
III’s Captain, Bill Hanrahan, a graduate of the Great Lakes Maritime
Academy, has over&amp;#0160;30 years of experience; the crews combined experience
is just under 200 years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.&amp;#0160; Ann Arbor, MI was the site of GopherCon &amp;#39;92, a 50 person workshop for developers and users of the Gopher information system, a pioneering Internet publishing system that was for some brief furry moment the hot new thing on MTV and bigger than that super-complicated World Wide Web hypertext thing.&amp;#0160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt&#34;&gt;Prentiss Riddle wrote up the trip report for it,&lt;/a&gt; and here&amp;#39;s his writeup on my presentation at the time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RELATED TECHNOLOGIES: Ed Vielmetti of CICnet gave a talk on &amp;quot;what we would be gathering to discuss if UMinn had never developed Gopher&amp;quot;, meaning primarily World-Wide Web (WWW). WWW was developed for the high-energy physics community and serves as a model of what Gopher could do if a discipline-oriented virtual community invested in it&lt;br /&gt;heavily. WWW is based on SGML (Standard General Markup Language&amp;quot;), an ISO standard for marking up text which WWW uses to implement hypertext. SGML is a bear and it is a significant investment of effort to properly add a document to WWW, but the result is quite powerful (for instance, WWW handles footnotes in hypertext). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet periodically notices that Gopher is not dead; here are a survey of the current Gopher infrastructure from &lt;a href=&#34;http://kottke.org/06/08/gopher-still-going&#34;&gt;Jason Kottke&lt;/a&gt;, some April development from &lt;a href=&#34;http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/geekery/howto_make_a_weblog_a_gopherlog.php&#34;&gt;George Hotelling&lt;/a&gt;, and a manifesto from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scn.org/%7Ebkarger/gopher-manifesto&#34;&gt;Bjorn Karger&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;
