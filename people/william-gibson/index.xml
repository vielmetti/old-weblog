      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon&#34; title=&#34;Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it&#39;s easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya&#39;s &#34;How to Solve It&#34; (1945), David Sucher&#39;s &#34;City Comforts&#34; (2003), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbenedikt.com/&#34;&gt;Michael Benedikt&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s anthology &#34;Cyberspace: First Steps&#34; (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can&#39;t simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt&#39;s &#34;Cyberspace&#34;. It&#39;s a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there&#39;s anything of common use that defines it, it&#39;s the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I&#39;m stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that&#39;s true to the work? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for &#34;vielmetti benedikt cyberspace&#34; should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace&#34;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.librarything.com/work/31259&#34;&gt;Librarything&lt;/a&gt; (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every work, there&#39;s some chance that an echo of it will be online too; &lt;a href=&#34;http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf&#34;&gt;IEU in Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What&#39;s more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;noted as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interview with Benedikt in &lt;a href=&#34;http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;amp;pff=1&#34;&gt;AIGA&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>anti-internet texts from the 1990s</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.acturban.org/biennial/doc_planners/treanor_internet_hyperliberalism.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. On the contrary: never before in history, have so many separate networks been technically possible. Linking all networks together is a conscious choice by some people, a choice then imposed on others. The logic is identical to that of colonial governments, which forced peasants into the agricultural market, by imposing cash taxes. (To pay the tax, the peasants had to sell cash crops such as sugar). This logic says in effect: &amp;#39;no one is free to stay outside the free market&amp;#39;. Today, not just governments, but business, social movements, intellectuals and artists, all want to impose the Net. This broad movement is obviously more than profit-seeking (and a non-profit Net would also be wrong). It is an ideological movement seeking ideological imposition. That imposition itself, the universalism, the expansionism, their involuntary nature, the basic unfreedom to exit - that is what makes liberal structures wrong. That applies to the free market, and it applies inherently to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=2299&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Pandora&amp;#39;s Vox Redux&lt;/a&gt; (humdog, 1994)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many times in cyberspace, i felt it necessary to say that i was human. once, i was told that i existed primarily as a voice in somebody’s head. lots of times, i need to see handwriting on paper or a photograph or a phone conversation to confirm the humanity of the voice, but that is the way that i am. i resist being boxed and inventoried and i guess i take william gibson seriously when he writes about machine intelligence and constructs. i do not like it. i suspect that my words have been extracted and that when this essay shows up, they will be extracted some more. when i left cyberspace, i left early one morning and forgot to take out the trash. two friends called me on the phone afterwards and said, hummie your directory is still there. and i said OH. and they knew and i knew, that it was possible that people had been entertaining themselves with the contents of my directories. the amusement never ends, as peter gabriel wrote. maybe sometime i will rant again if something interesting comes up. in the meantime, give my love to the FBI.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliff Stoll in Newsweek, &lt;a href=&#34;http://threewordchant.com/2010/02/24/why-the-internet-will-fail-from-1995/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Why The Internet Will Fail&lt;/a&gt; (1995)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who’d prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where–in the holy names of Education and Progress–important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid-1990s were a good time to be high-mindedly anti-network.&lt;/p&gt;
