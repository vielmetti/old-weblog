      <description>&lt;p&gt;One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify
the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing
like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items
that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the
time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once,
and it stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do
in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on. I
use github issues to track my big pile of things to do, and alas
it does not have a random() function. Fortunately though there is
a Github API, and that combined with &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; and my &lt;code&gt;randomline&lt;/code&gt; script
are enough to approximate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third very reasonable approach is to ask someone what they would
like you to do; or even better yet anticipate what they would ask
and do it before they ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reminds me, I have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
