      <description>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the &#34;Paid for by&#34; language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.
I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook.</description>

      <description>from UPI in their &#34;quirks&#34; section:  ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Officials in Ann Arbor, Mich., are working on a plan to allow residents of the college town to set up their own chicken coops. City Councilman Stephen Kunselman told his colleagues during the weekend there is support among residents who like the idea of having access to &#34;farm fresh&#34; eggs, which some foodies consider to be tastier and healthier than the store-bought variety.</description>
