      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private &lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com&#34; rel=&#34;homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &amp;quot;ubiquity&amp;quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to ubiquity and focus, I&amp;#39;d like to suggest a third axis of utility for social media - &amp;quot;isolation&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s the notion that you can go somewhere online and do something special that&amp;#39;s unlike anything else on the net, and that because of this the rules that have accreted over time about expected behavior are different.&lt;br id=&#34;.reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]&#34; /&gt;&lt;br id=&#34;.reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[2]&#34; /&gt;As an example, I have an account on &lt;a href=&#34;http://pinterest.com/&#34; rel=&#34;homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Pinterest&#34;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; that I use nearly exclusively for collecting maps. I don&amp;#39;t follow all of my friends there, and I don&amp;#39;t expect that people will follow me just because they are my friends. Similarly, a few friends have Plurk accounts in a little circle where no one expects that anyone else will read what they write and where there is a decided element of silliness that would not play on Facebook.&lt;br id=&#34;.reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]&#34; /&gt;&lt;br id=&#34;.reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[5]&#34; /&gt;I think we all need a little corner of the net to call our own. Facebook ranks very low on the isolation scale and so it will not appeal to those who are looking for a quiet corner to express themselves. A lightly trafficked wiki, your own blog, or the carefully walled off corner of an interest-specific forum can all have that isolation factor that lets us be sociable but not to the entire world all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unknowledge management</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-unknowledge-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 09:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-unknowledge-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nooron.org/know/uplift_linguistic_shell/unknowledge_pattern_language&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The Unknowledge Pattern Language&lt;/a&gt;, on Nooron:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&amp;#39;t know about the elements, until we &amp;quot;filled in the blanks.&amp;quot; These &amp;quot;named voids&amp;quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery? The discovery of zero, a &amp;quot;missing nothing,&amp;quot; was one of the turning points in Western thought. Are there other missing nothings lurking about, waiting to be discovered? If so, how do we name these voids, and to what end? This is the stuff of unknowledge management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a name to something is a powerful act of creation. The ability to describe the unknown and nonexistent with words that are suggestive of its qualities creates a new universe of the plausible alternatives to the way that things are right now, and gives a way forward either to discover the absent or to rename existing concepts as though they were brand new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first hand experience in this world is in the world of wiki, where any name can be the target of commentary. Your wiki link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Price_of_a_cup_of_coffee&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Price of a cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;is real, even if the page that answers that query is currently blank. At a later time you can bind the name to its commentary, and use the statistics you get from watching people explore the unknowledge of the world to decide which of it to bring to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A counterpoint to this line of reasoning is the periodic need to unname things which have names, so that they can grow new names that are newly reflective of the current observation. We didn&amp;#39;t know that we had land-line phones and terrestrial radios until cell phones and satellite radios forced the use of distinctive nomenclature. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit to Pete Kaminski, who has used the word &amp;quot;incipient links&amp;quot; to describe the deliberate use of wiki pointers to nowhere, and to Tom Munnecke for Nooron and the phrase &amp;quot;unknowledge management&amp;quot;. Pete also gave me &amp;quot;great weird ideas&amp;quot;, where this clearly fits.&lt;/p&gt;
