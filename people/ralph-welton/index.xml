      <description>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.
I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city&#39;s employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained.</description>
