The city of Ypsilanti will restore the historic Ypsilanti Freighthouse located in Depot Town. The project will include major structural improvements to the foundation, floor, walls, pilasters, roof and interior mechanical systems. These items, outlined in a Conditional Assessment Report, are required to re-open the 1878 facility, which is planned to serve as a community center, farmers market, caf√© and education center.</description>
