      <description>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&amp;#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&amp;#39;s, ALS, etc.).
 One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a diversity of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds.</description>
