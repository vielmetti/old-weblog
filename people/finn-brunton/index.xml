      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest in cryptocurrencies is the Juggalocoin, proposed to handle the transactional needs of the fans of the Insane Clown Posse. From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6049084/meet-the-insane-coin-posse-juggalos-get-their-own&#34;&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt; (because after all this is an entertainment story):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whoop whoop! A very tech-savvy Juggalo by the name of Papa Nutt has taken it upon himself to create a cryptocurrency specifically for Faygo-chugging devotees of &#34;the Family&#34; to buy goods and services with*, especially at the upcoming Gathering of the Juggalos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the acid test of any coin: can you buy Faygo with it? From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/09/juggalocoins_the_cryptocurrency_for_insane_clown_posse_fans.html&#34;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems quite possible this is all a good joke, but given the purchasing power of the Juggaloes, the Faygo company might want to update its payment system just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=568484.0&#34;&gt;Bitcointalk&lt;/a&gt;, someone who calls themself &#34;Juggalocoin&#34; launches into a spirited defense of the currency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To reach the huge non-crypto masses requires something they can identify with.  Dogecoin did it.  Kinda.  In a weird, fleeting way.  Doge is just a glimpse of what&#39;s possible.  But memes have a VERY limited lifespan.  Doge may grow beyond the meme.  I don&#39;t know.  But with Juggalos, it&#39;s not about a meme.  It&#39;s about a community.  A community that already exists, and has been around for over 20 years!  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This is the innovation that JuggaloCoin offers:  A coin that appeals to a very specific, very tight community.  A community of over 1 million people.  We are offering a real opportunity for crypto to dramatically increase its reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang&#39;an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good pre-meeting reading is Finn Brunton, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artforum.com/inprint/issue=201402&amp;amp;id=45005&#34;&gt;More Problems More Money&lt;/a&gt;, Artforum, February 2014. (Free registration required.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/finn-brunton-the-accidental-archive-notes-on-a-talk-monday-january-28-2013.html&#34;&gt;2013 talk by Finn Brunton on The Accidental Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes from the talk follow here. I kept a running log with Twitter, and I&#39;m writing this from my Pinboard &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:bitcoin&#34;&gt;bitcoin bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;; these links are to the bookmarks for ease of linking for the most park. I&#39;m not trying to reconstruct the talk, just to give context for my bookmarks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk started off with a discussion of the Audrey Hepburn film &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:charade&#34;&gt;Charade&lt;/a&gt;, in which the mystery of what happened to the wealth of a family is only resolved when it&#39;s realized that rather than searching for lost money that they should be trying to make sense of the tail of rare stamps. This was the kickoff to an extended and wide-ranging discussion of the various roles and purposes of money throughout history and how very odd things that don&#39;t look like currency at all still functioned as stores of value, units of account, or mediums of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has peculiar mathematical properties that make it unusually suited for use as a store of value. Bitcoins are mined through a process that&#39;s NP-hard, which means for practical purposes that it&#39;s difficult to create them but easy to prove that they are real. Bitcoin is a &#34;proof of work&#34;; someone did something hard, consuming scarce computing power and copious amounts of energy, in order to accomplish a task that&#39;s easy to confirm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn talked about other coin systems (usually lumped under the term &#34;altcoin&#34;) that are based on Bitcoin but that are run separately and have their own twists. There&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:allahcoin&#34;&gt;Allahcoin&lt;/a&gt;, which donates a percentage of each transaction to the Muslim Brotherhood; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:aphroditecoin&#34;&gt;Aphroditecoin&lt;/a&gt;, which is doing an &#34;air drop&#34; to give citizens of Cyprus their own money; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:mazacoin&#34;&gt;Mazacoin&lt;/a&gt;, from the Oglala Lakota Nation; &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:freicoin&#34;&gt;Freicoin&lt;/a&gt;, which depreciates through &#34;demurrage&#34; if you don&#39;t spend it; and most notably &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin&#34;&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, a joke of a currency that nevertheless raised enough money through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:dogesled&#34;&gt;Dogesled&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser to help send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin&#34;&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; was noted as an exemplary virtual currency, in part because unlike Bitcoin it&#39;s not worth very much and in part because the Dogecoin community is willing to spend it rather than hoard it. So people give Dogecoin tips readily - a few Dogecoin for posting a funny picture of a dog - and are generous in sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is not even the first of the efforts to create alternative currencies on the internet. I worked at First Virtual Holdings in the 90s, which is one of the payment mechanisms discussed in a Jeff Mackie-Mason paper on digital payments. Not all of these enterprises ended up well, e.g the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold&#34;&gt;E-Gold&lt;/a&gt; system which saw its owner convicted of a conspiracy to engage in money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn talked about some of the crazy things you can do with Dogecoin, and described the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/02/paste-goes-to-the-worlds-first-dogecoin-meetup.html&#34;&gt;first Dogecoin meetup&lt;/a&gt; in New York City where he noted that kombucha was for sale - payable only in Dogecoin. The conclusion I draw is that cryptocurrencies are equal parts community and technology, and that you get radically different social results when you keep the technology basically the same but change the initial conditions of community formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This over-simplifies and leaves out some really good and funny bits, but should give you some flavor for the talk. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>African National Congress Secret Communications: &#34;Operation Vula&#34;</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/2013-12-09-african-national-congress-secret-communications-operation-vula/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 23:51:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/2013-12-09-african-national-congress-secret-communications-operation-vula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4693&#34;&gt;Talking to Vula&lt;/a&gt; is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa. The account (which was pointed out to me by Finn Brunton) talks of an inventive use of encrypted text transmitted via analog modem tones recorded to cassette tape and then played back via untraceable pay phones. It&#39;s a remarkable tale of late 80s underground crypto, leading up to the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the text, to give you a flavor of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis I wrote a little program to send some computer output to the modem. Sure enough the sounds came out of the modem`s speaker. These I recorded and played back into the microphone end of the modem while running a communications program on the computer. Eureka! The characters appeared on the screen. I had done with a modem what we were attempting to do with our tone machine.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This seemed to be the real breakthrough. I adapted our encryption program to work with the acoustic modem and recorded the output on a tape recorder. This I took to a public telephone booth and played back to my answering machine. Then I played the answering machine &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; back into the modem and the computer deciphered it successfully. As the plaintext message appeared on the screen I realised that we had finally discovered an absolutely safe method of communicating with the underground using computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work originally appeared in a series of six articles in the ANC`s monthly journal Mayibuye from May 1995 to October 1995. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More: &lt;a href=&#34;http://irevolution.net/2008/04/06/operation-vula-ict-versus-apartheid/&#34;&gt;Operation Vula: ICT versus Apartheid&lt;/a&gt; (2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the raw text output of a chat session with a bot I modified to act as an interlocutor.

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finn Brunton, U-M Assistant Professor of Information, will present &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/node/1280591&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The Accidental Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Brunton&amp;#39;s talk, with the alternative title &amp;quot;Researching criminals, otherkin, cipher anarchists, spammers and the online history that doesn&amp;#39;t want to be kept,&amp;quot; kicks off a new series of monthly events addressing emergent research. Light refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to follow. There&amp;#39;s a hashtag, #MLibRes, on which a half dozen people are tracking. This is an impressionistic transcript, not a summary or tidy narrative, more notes drawn from what I remember from the time and some of my own thoughts mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preservation is constant toil, entropy requires no maintenance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links are not permanent, and the scholar who depends on them persisting risks losing their research materials. Finn gave out bits of a manifesto, one of which was &amp;quot;embrace wget&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of the Good Neighbor, a theory of library collection shelving from Aby Warberg. &lt;a href=&#34;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;amp;type=summary&amp;amp;url=/journals/common_knowledge/v018/18.1.steinberg.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;An essay of the same name by Michael Steinberg.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion of Rodona Garst, a notorious spammer, and the ephemeral collections of data about her operations collected under the name &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20040202002820/http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Behind Enemy Lines. One such collection is on archive.org&lt;/a&gt; so it has some hope of permanence. (but if you really want a copy, make one now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Blue is an institutional repository run by the University of Michigan. One notable project archived there is the Michigan Terminal System, which has original distribution tapes saved into non-ephemeral bits. Finn has been collecting tarballs of references for the works he&amp;#39;s done, and one idea (new to him and recommended by the audience) was to put his tarballs in Deep Blue, with the right kind of dark-archive permanence that was suitable to the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference to &amp;quot;shearing layers&amp;quot; from Stewart Brand&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;How buildings learn&amp;quot;. Different parts of the system change at different speeds. &lt;a href=&#34;http://quietbabylon.com/2011/shearing-layers-of-stuff-dematerialization-4/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;From Quiet Babylon, a discussion of shearing layers&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heresies expounded: &amp;quot;we should save everything&amp;quot;, primarily because the Internet is all significant but to different populations. The example given is the Enron corpus, which is also a very useful spam corpus; if you discarded the spam you&amp;#39;d have been left with something less useful. Saving everything is problematic to archivists who are used to assessing collections and picking the good parts and compiling a finding aid, rather than taking all of the unfiled materials and collecting them willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more, but this captures the flavor of the event well; there will be a recording released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future events are Fourth Mondays. Follow @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/UMLibRes&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;UMLibRes&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
