      <description>&lt;p&gt;some interesting research from Marcus Foth in Australia about community networking; any paper that cites &#34; Intranets and Local Community: &#39;Yes, an intranet is all very well, but do we still get free beer and a barbeque?&#39; &#34; is OK by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories of networked individualism and forms of urban alienation challenge the continued purpose and relevance of conventional community tools in urban neighbourhood. However, the majority of urban residents surveyed in this research still believe that there are people living in their immediate neighbourhood who may share their interests or who are at least personally compatible, but they do not know them. Web-based community networking systems have the potential to facilitate intra-neighbourhood interaction and support community building efforts. Community networking studies have shown that technical connectivity alone does not ensure community, and that new and weak communities do not benefit from community networking systems as much as existing and strong communities do. This paper builds on these findings to present a methodology combining principles of Participation, Animation and Design (PAD). It is currently being employed and tested in a master-planned inner-city residential development. PAD builds on intrinsic motivation in residents to find out about and meet one another in a private and inobtrusive way. It encourages residents to take social ownership of the community building process and the community network. PAD recognises the network qualities in the communicative ecology of urban residents and supplements collective approaches towards community building with personalised networking strategies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
