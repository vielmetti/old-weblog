<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>Today is a Twitter conference, so Twitter is full of good stuff people have been saving up.&#0160; Here&#39;s one: a &quot;conversation prism&quot; in bright happy colors showing a set of categories of tools, and how each one of them is occupied by some set of applications.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mapping of each of them onto the set of tools that I am using to keep a2b3 loosely connected.&#0160;
Sorry no links, didn&#39;t have time to hyperlink everything <a href="http://theconversationprism.com" title="The Conversation Prism by Brian Solis and Jesse Thomas"><img src="http://theconversationprism.com/convoprismembed.jpg" style="border: 0px solid #666666;" /></a></p><p>The Conversation Prism by <a href="http://briansolis.com">Brian Solis</a> and <a href="http://jess3.com">Jesse Thomas</a></p>
<br /><p><br />Forums: Yahoo Groups</p><p>This is the biggest single tool I use for group continuity; it perhaps reflects my elderly nature that email is the first system rather than web-based forums or modern social networks.&#0160; All I can say in my defense is that Usenet would have been better but it&#39;s really not available, and that I have 10 years of continuous use into Yahoo Groups and they haven&#39;t ruined it (yet).</p><p>Social networks: Facebook (intermittently)</p><p>Facebook will show up here frequently, if only because it&#39;s ubiquitous and because Ann Arbor is full of people who use it.&#0160; My sense is that its group tools are way weaker than its personal tools and so it&#39;s best used as an adjunct to the main Yahoo group just so you can attach names to faces and so you can promote events.</p><p>&quot;Interest and curated networks&quot; (?): LinkedIn</p><p>I&#39;m not sure about the category, but LinkedIn certainly qualifies as one ongoing conversation starting and continuing tool.&#0160; Like Facebook, groups are second class objects in LinkedIn, and thus it&#39;s weak at building cohesion.&#0160; On the plus side you don&#39;t have to pretend to be someone&#39;s pal to look up their resume.</p><p>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</p><p>There are a bunch of national scale review sites, but nothing beats asking a good sized group of your peers for recommendations on everything from programming language libraries to pest control.&#0160; To whatever extent possible, Arborwiki becomes the public long term storage for what would otherwise be something ephemeral and hard to retrieve through the Yahoo Groups search interface.</p><p>Location: none; I gave up on Plaxo when it creeped me out</p><p>Location-based mobile services are supposed to be the future of the social mobile web, but I lived through having my location visible on Plaxo and decided against living that way when people who knew where I was without me telling them didn&#39;t have the social clues not to be obvious that they were watching me.&#0160;&#0160; If I want to tell you where I am I&#39;ll be explicit about it on Twitter, or you can just wonder.</p><p>Video: whatever people use</p><p>There are a couple of filmmakers in the group, and I respect their judgement what to use for video.&#0160; None of the video tools have strong group membership characteristics - or even particularly weak ones - so I treat them all pretty much interchangably as dumb hosting.&#0160; (And no, I don&#39;t particular care if any given short video clip goes viral.)</p><p>Customer Service: Get Satisfaction, but it&#39;s not quite right</p><p>If a2b3 was a business it might need customer support, but it&#39;s not, and Get Satisfaction is just extra baggage.&#0160; Tried it, it seemed to be functional, but not for the problem at hand.</p><p>Documents/Content: SlideShare seems to be a favorite</p><p>Those people who are giving presentations seem to have settled on SlideShare as a common denominator for hosting.&#0160; The weekly lunches don&#39;t feature presentations so there&#39;s no natural synchronization around it as a tool, but it works as advertised.</p><p>Events: upcoming, Facebook events, in-person lunch w/announcements</p><p>Events are perhaps the hardest nut to crack, the thing that would make you spend all week promoting other people&#39;s work and the like.&#0160; I have been telling people who don&#39;t have URLs for events to post them to upcoming; Facebook will tell you about more parties than you can manage to go to; and there&#39;s nothing like someone telling you about something around the table.&#0160; The only way to really lick the events question is to have someone full time collecting them.</p><p>Music: One each of everything; I&#39;m fond of how blip.fm twitters out songs</p><p>blip.fm is the closest thing to Napster that&#39;s out there; do a Twitter search for your favorite artist plus the word &quot;blip&quot; and you may be lucky enough to find a fellow fan and a track you can listen to.&#0160;&#0160; YouTube is also really good for songs - my 4 y/o calls it &quot;picture music&quot;.</p><p>Wiki: Arborwiki, plus my own private Socialtext space</p><p>Arborwiki is the designated spot for dropping in information that deserves to live in a wiki; the &quot;Birthday Deals&quot; page there is the one universal attraction point around which much of the rest lives.&#0160; I keep a Socialtext private wiki for my own personal memory augmentation tool, in part because it works awesomely on my Blackberry.</p><p>Livecasting video: haven&#39;t done it yet, not appropriate for lunch</p><p>If you want to join in to lunch, you don&#39;t want to watch it remotely; the space isn&#39;t set up for that.&#0160; If and when I get to a place where regular live video streaming makes sense I&#39;ll use whatever the cool kids are using then.</p><p>Pictures: Flickr, Facebook photos</p><p>Once upon a time Flickr was a dynamic photo community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly creative people who you really wanted to share pictures with.&#0160; Then everything grew up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and my camera died.&#0160; Now if I want to share a photo I&#39;m more likely to put it on Facebook.&#0160; I miss the old Flickr.</p><p>Social bookmarks: Delicious, plus whatever Les is working on</p><p>Once upon a time Delicious was a dynamic bookmark community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly smart people who you really wanted to share bookmarks with.&#0160; Then everything group up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and Twitter came along.&#0160; Now if I want to share a link I think twice and either twitter it out or work it into a longer blog post.&#0160; I just hope my 10,000 bookmarks stick around for a long time.</p><p>Comment and reputation: plenty of that around the lunch table</p><p>There&#39;s enough people who I care to converse with that I know by face and name that the level of comment-tracking promoted by blog tools seems irrelevant, for the most part, or at least too much work.</p><p>Crowdsourced content: arborwiki, a2geeks</p><p>Both arborwiki and a2geeks have enough of a wiki platform running for general and for technical info that if you need to crowdsource something there&#39;s a place to point people toward to edit things.</p><p>Collaboration: Google Spreadsheets (for football parking info)</p><p>If I need to collect a bunch of numbers from a bunch of people, Google Spreadsheets seems to do pretty well.&#0160; I love wiki for private collaboration, but you have to be collaborating with people who love it too.&#0160; Otherwise, printing things out and letting someone else wrestle with tracking changes in Microsoft Word is about as good as I get.</p><p>Blog platforms: Typepad</p><p>Someone else worries about it and I just hit &quot;post&quot;.</p><p>Blogs/conversations: Google Blog Search is the best of a bad lot</p><p>It&#39;s hard to track conversations in blogs, in part because the blog vs comment distinction is weird.&#0160; It&#39;s just as easy to do regular Google searches and put in teh word &quot;blog&quot; as an added qualifier.</p><p>Blog communities: mybloglog</p><p>I&#39;m using this mostly for stats and to detect one-day spikes that mean that some seasonal post is current again or to notice when something is on fire.</p><p>Micromedia: Twitter</p><p>twitter, duh.&#0160; </p><p>Twitter ecosystems: trying out Cotweet</p><p>I have a beta account; it&#39;s working pretty well to do future scheduled postings and to better track responses.&#0160; Not sure yet if and how to open up the @a2b3 account to multiple posters but that&#39;s the next obvious thing.</p><p>SMS/Voice: Google Voice</p><p>It converts voice mail to text so that I don&#39;t have to listen to all of my voice mail.&#0160; Still in closed beta.</p><p>Lifestreams: get a life!&#0160; need some privacy sometime</p><p>Part of living a life is deciding what to broadcast to the Internet and what to keep quiet.&#0160; I&#39;m just as happy to be offline as online, and the idea that you should soulcast every last mood swing seems to be as unproductive as it gets</p><p>----</p><p>After working my way through this, I realize what it&#39;s missing - all of these apps I write about are apps that work on a big screen.&#0160; The real conversation prism also includes a parallel set of augmented reality supported by mobile devices, and that very well may include entirely new categories than above.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On Thursday May 22 I had lunch with the a2b3 group for the 183d time.&#0160; I&#39;m writing that down as though it was a perfectly accurate number, just so that next week I can look it up and say that it will be the 184th time.</p><p>Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.&#0160; This week it felt like Groundhog Day, where I was the Bill Murray character practicing piano lessons over and over again until I really was the person who was good at hosting lunch for 30 instead of someone wondering whether I could pull off hosting lunch more than once.</p><p>It was a quiet week in Ann Arbor, my home town, where Garrison Keillor comes to do his Prairie Home Companion every once in a while at lovely Hill Auditorium, though he didn&#39;t come this week and won&#39;t come next week but he might show up at any moment, making you think that he was just a voice from the radio even though you could see him on stage.&#0160; Ann Arbor is still the third or fourth best city in the nation for any number of things that you could measure, and if anyone wants to put together the convincing statistic that ranks this town in the best in the nation for bi bim bap I am certain that our civic leaders can devise the numerator and demoninator for the metric that proves it.&#0160; And we&#39;re justly proud of our long civic history of providing parking structures for all of the cars of all of the vistors who come to our charming town to experience its pedestrian charms.</p><p>Every week, after I give a short speech, I ask a question.&#0160; Some of them are great questions, and some of them are ordinary questions, and mostly they give the lunch patron a chance to say something about themselves that doesn&#39;t depend on the &quot;what do you do for a living&quot; answer because when you are free for lunch sometimes that is because you are in a career transition and your sense of personal identity that used to be wrapped up in your job is cut adrift.&#0160; No one needs to be put on the spot that way, so the lunch question admits a certain ambiguity about your day job.</p><p>People introduce themselves, say a few words, and hand the microphone on.&#0160; We started using a microphone because the table seats 35 and it&#39;s the entire length of the restaurant.&#0160; The people who come back again and again sometimes get good at describing who they are in a few words that can be repeated faithfully by anyone else who is similarly a regular.&#0160; The question is almost always optional, and people are always free to ask their own question or to ask for assistance from the group from some problem, thorny and pressing or trivial and mundane; generally the specific answers wait until afterwards when people talk among themselves again.</p><p>I try to introduce the whole table by 1 pm so people can move to the next thing they need to do.&#0160; It has been a remarkable crowd for many reasons, not the least of which is the wide variety in ages of the people at the table, ranging this week from just out of high school to nearly retired.&#0160; It&#39;s a special design of no specific purpose that you need to get a diverse crowd - by not having a clear cut agenda, you make it possible to let pretty much any person who shows up be the right person to arrive.</p><p>At the end there is some attempt to organize information about upcoming events, either meetings of other groups that organize regularly, or one time events that someone is planning.&#0160; </p><p>With the routine as established as it is, and with enough people knowing what to expect and how to work within the time boundaries that are the only real fixed limits, it&#39;s been possible for me not to show up and not to announce that the event is happening and have everything go pretty much the same as if I were there.&#0160; </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Google search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=black+river+falls+michigan+fire+map">black river falls michigan fire map</a></p>

<p>Twitter search: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=black%20river%20falls">black river falls</a></p>

<p>As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&nbsp; It's not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there's a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.</p>

<p>When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.&nbsp; I'm hoping to collect some of that same level of detail here.&nbsp; It's always a big concern when forests burn, especially when they burn uncontrolled in land that doesn't have a lot of roads in it.</p>

<p>Here's some details I've been able to figure out so far.</p>

<p>The Yooper Daily blog from Shawn and Brian Malone, commercial photographers, has a post titled simply <a href="http://yooperdaily.blogspot.com/2009/05/wildfires-break-out-in-up.html">Wildfires Break Out In UP.</a> They have an approximate map of the Black River Falls fire which shows it deep in the woods of Ely Township. </p>

<p>A lot of my searches go to another fire called the <a href="http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3321">Black River Falls fire, but in Jackson County Wisconsin;</a> this historical marker describes a 1977 fire, the traces of which are almost gone by now with timber regrowth.</p>

<p>The Remote Sensing Applications Center of the USDA Forest Service has a series of maps, including this <a href="http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/activefiremaps.php?op=maps&rCode=enm">Northern Midwest fire map</a> (Northern Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin).&nbsp; The current one I'm looking at shows the Pinery Fire near L'Anse, MI, but nothing from the Black River Falls fire. The scale on this is fairly large, so it doesn't pin down the precise acreage, just the nearest town.</p>

<p><img  src="file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;<img  src="file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="">For a more detailed map you turn to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr">Michigan DNR</a>, which is preparing maps for active fire fighting. This sample shows the extent of the fire as of last update, though it doesn't have a date on the map, the file date is 20090521 (may 21, 2009).&nbsp; <a style="display: inline;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b image-full " alt="Picture 2" title="Picture 2" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-800wi" border="0"></a> 
</p>

<p><br><p>I&rsquo;m stopping here because this is what I started looking for, and you&rsquo;ll want to stay tuned to whatever other news sources you have if you&rsquo;re close to the fire.</p></p>

<p>On twitter I notice updates from <a href="http://twitter.com/MDNR">@MDNR</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wluctv6">@wluctv6</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/miningjournal">@miningjournal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nortman">@nortman</a> and expect to collect more.&nbsp; It's worth noting that the Mining Journal has extremely terse 60 character headlines on Twitter which means that typical keyword style searches don't find them very well, though once you do find their news stream the writing and reporting is first rate, and they have <a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/527617.html">interviews of people at the Red Cross shelter at Westwood High School</a> which is quite evidently information central for families affected by the blaze. </p>

<blockquote>
ISHPEMING - Sandwiches, coffee, donuts, cots to sleep on - the American Red Cross shelter, set up at the Westwood High School gym, was ready to fill the needs of residents evacuated due to the Black River Falls fire off Marquette County Road 581.

The thing the evacuees were wanting most, however, was news about the fire.

Of the 300 people who passed through the shelter Wednesday, the vast majority wanted news about their homes and neighbors, said Red Cross Executive Director Kayla West.

"They wanted information more than anything," she said.

      </h3>
      <p>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&#39;re better than me.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.westsidefarmersmarket.com/">Westside Farmers Market</a>, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&#0160; </p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ann Arbor&#39;s Westside Farmers&#39; Market is currently &quot;on hold&quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor.</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/zoning_violation_shuts_down_an.html">The Ann Arbor News story by Judy McGovern reads</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The property&#39;s C3 zoning is the most relaxed of the three commercial categories, but it doesn&#39;t allow the kind of &quot;special use&quot; permits that can be issued to properties in the more restrictive C1 and C2 categories.<br /><br />That appears to be an oversight in the regulations, and city officials are working to change the code, said City Council Member Carsten Hohnke, whose 5th Ward includes the property.<br /><br /></div><p>I read through <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Ordinances/Pages/Online%20City%20Code.aspx">city code</a>; it appears that C3 zoning (5:10.23) for the properly in question is preferential to properties where automotive access is the characteristic function:</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="blockquote l0" style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">Intent.</span>&#0160;
            <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">The
design and regulations of this district are set up to provide for
certain types of commercial activities which have characteristics in
common. In this district, the customer usually comes directly to the
particular establishment by automobile, making a separate stop for each
errand. Comparison shopping activity is less than in the central
business district. Since there is little essential interdependence of
activities, establishments can be dispersed over considerable areas
with each establishment having its own automobile parking. Good
automobile accessibility is essential to these districts. The uses
permitted, because of their lack of intense pedestrian activity and
their required contact with auto access, would be incompatible in the
central business district.</span>&#0160;
            </div>
</div><p><br />The get-out-of-jail-free card is this language on special use permits, as described in the C-1 Local Business District language (5.10.15):</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="l1 blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">(h)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;The City Council may, by resolution, designate
certain dates and locations as special events temporary outdoor sales
areas. Said resolution shall include conditions and standards of
conduct to be in force for outdoor sales and displays on private
property. A property owner who wishes to conduct outdoor sales and
displays on his or her private property, as provided for in the council
resolution, shall first apply for and receive a Zoning Compliance
Permit by the date designated in the resolution. The conditions and
standards contained in the resolution shall be conditions of the Zoning
Compliance Permit issued to a property owner. Failure to comply with
the conditions set in the resolution shall be a violation of this
ordinance section and shall be grounds to revoke all permits granted to
the property owner for the duration of the special event identified in
the resolution.</div>
</div><p><br />The question, is appears, is whether the C-1 &quot;special events&quot; language applies to C-3 zoning, or whether there is no permit possible for someone in the automotive, big box, strip mall and huge parking lot district to ever do a temporary outdoor sales area.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>Given that Zingerman&#39;s had a previous permit for this use I suspect there&#39;s some other story not yet being told.&#0160; Your guess is as good as mine what prompted this whole snafu.&#0160; <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/04/development_dirt_dda_drug_stor.html">Zingerman&#39;s has had disputes with the city about their 322 E Kingsley property&#39;s zoning</a> , which have come to council recently.</p>

<p>Without going into lots of detail I do want to share one recent paper that caught my eye, via Leysia Palen: <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Epalen/Papers/iscram08/BackchannelsISCRAM08.pdf">Backchannels on the Front Lines: Emergent Uses of Social Media in the 2007 Southern California Wildfires.</a></p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Opportunities for participation by members of the public are expanding the information arena of disaster.&#0160; Social media supports “backchannel” communications, allowing for wide-scale interaction that can be collectively resourceful, self-policing, and generative of information that is otherwise hard to obtain. Results from our study of information practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires suggest that community information resources and other backchannel communications activity enabled by social media are gaining prominence in the disaster arena, despite concern by officials about the legitimacy of information shared through such means. We argue that these emergent uses of social media are pre-cursors of broader future changes to the institutional and organizational arrangements of disaster response. </div>
<p><br />The term &quot;crisis informatics&quot; is credited to Christine Hagar (2006).&#0160; If you do a proper retrospective look at the phenomenon without that term, you unearth previous discussion of the use of the net for responses in the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes, hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and various power outages and ice storms.&#0160; A proper retrospective bibliography awaits someone else&#39;s project.</p>

 Cutler-Magner salt dock in Duluth. Up went the ladders, and the crew members of the
 Algoway scrambled down to do a little shopping … &ldquo; </font></div></p>

 article for a recent edition of the Nor’easter, the journal of the Lake Superior

      <p>I put up a little project on github last night, <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter mutual friends</a>.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.</p><p>I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</p><p>The existing Twitter feedback for these is very limited, based almost entirely on numerical counts.&#0160; I thought I could do better by examining what kind of mutual relationships already existed between me and other people and to see if I could characterize folks based on who else they followed to know at least which part of my life they might have found me by.</p><p>Thus, the twitter mutual friends effort.&#0160; The simplest version of this downloads two friend lists, and looks for overlap.&#0160; The list of overlapping ids is walked through, noting who the overlapping people are, what their last twitter was, how many people they in turn were following, and the like.&#0160; </p><p>You could look either at friends, followers, or mutual friend/follow pairs; you can derive things from the text of recent tweets from mutual friends, or their follow counts, or other second derivatives of mutuality or reciprocity.&#0160; At some point there&#39;s a nice visual of all of this, as well as some good textual analysis (&quot;trending words in our mutual followers&quot;).&#0160; But as a start this is just an effort to get beyond simple counting and into network views of twitter.</p>

<p>According to a report in The Michigan Citizen, the court earlier granted in part the prosecutor’s request to “preclude argument, the asking of questions, and the introduction of any other evidence purporting to show that defendant was acting in her capacity as a reporter during the events in question,” and “rul[ed] essentially that only Bukowski could testify regarding her role as a reporter.”</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/santa-barbara-and-montecito-t-fire.html">When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California</a>, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.</p><p>As a small public service, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/category/problems/">the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog</a>, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again.&#0160; His piece on <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/05/07/some-clues-for-covering-wildfires/">how the media need to do better reporting on wildfires</a> is spot on:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">With all due respect to the good jobs that most of the legacy media
are doing, their coverage could be much, much better if they paid
respect to those listening and watching online, which includes their
smart phones. What they need are plain hard facts, rather than the
vague, boiled-down or sensationalized stuff that was News As Usual for
the duration.</p><p>Take home point #3 is all you need:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Uncomplicate your damn websites</strong>. Without
exception, legacy media have websites that are far too complicated and
jam-packed with visual noise, including promotions of junk that is
highly uninteresting to visitors looking for hard facts about their
homes and neighborhoods.</p><p>There&#39;s much more news and many more photos than I can possibly link to here.&#0160; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=jesusita">On Twitter search for #jesusita</a> or #jesusitafire for lots of information.&#0160; <a href="http://timhatch.com/panos/jesusita-fire">Tim Hatch has some panoramic photos of the fire</a>.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sundowner-stress8-2009may08,0,7680616.story">LA Times always has good wildfire coverage</a>, not the great coverage that Doc wants for his neighbors, but something to put things in perspective from miles away.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Let me explain to you why those terms don&#39;t explain things very well.</p><p>I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers.</p><p>Public accounting at the turn of the century was hard work.&#0160; Not only did you have to come to some means of doing standard categorization for hundreds or thousands of categories of events and expenditures in a typical rail operation, but you also had to manage all that data flowing back to you as print and then reconstruct it into numbers.&#0160; And then you had to make the case that one type of patented equipment was much more dangerous than another and that some private enterprise needed to be coerced, encouraged, or jawboned into making investments in public safety.</p><p>You would think that 100 plus years later, with all of our wonderful technology, that things would be better.&#0160; You&#39;d be wrong.&#0160; Government organizations and publicly regulated institutions are still primarily putting together products designed to be printed, and in most cases there is very little thought put towards the use or reuse of the data hiding inside.&#0160; </p><p>In one extreme, this shows up as hundred plus page long PDFs of scanned in images presented to board members to help them make decisions, including scanned in spreadsheets that have numerical errors that cannot be audited without rekeying.&#0160; In another extreme, it means that no two public organizations that report the number of flu cases have precisely the same number, since their reporting cycles are different and no one is adding things up except at document preparation and print time.&#0160; </p><p>You can&#39;t count on critical public information being available in non-proprietary file formats, and you can&#39;t count on non-critical public information being made openly available to the public at all.</p><p>It&#39;s so bad that people trust Wikipedia more than they trust any other source, because at least with Wikipedia you know that what you&#39;re looking at might be wrong and there&#39;s a healthy dose of skepticism that can be dealt with by examining original documents.</p><p>So if I ask for that page of numbers as the spreadsheet it was originally, and a public records officer for a public body gives it to me as a bitmap, I&#39;m going to ask again and keep asking publicly and perhaps uncomfortably until we both understand that this is a routine request and that compliance with routine requests is much easier than making everything an exception - because maybe, just maybe, I can replace that FOIA letter with a tiny shell script and we can just go about our business.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m always behind on email, but this time it&#39;s worse than normal.&#0160; </p><p>Here&#39;s a catching up strategy.&#0160; To do this you need to know that anything I think might need a response gets a star in Gmail, but sometimes also gets archived for later.</p><p>1.&#0160; Move all starred items to the inbox<br />2.&#0160; Mark all inbox items as new<br />3.&#0160; Marvel that there are 238 things to read that haven&#39;t been touched<br />4.&#0160; Lean on the j key to zoom through them quickly<br />5.&#0160; Count only the number that hasn&#39;t been looked at at least once</p><p>I&#39;m also using tags in Gmail, so an additional strategy is to select all the messages, look in the labels tab, see which labels look weird, unselect everything, and then search just for the label you found (to deal with it or delete it).</p><p>This isn&#39;t so much a productivity hack as it is a despiration hack to make sure that of the things that have been overtaken by events, that they at least don&#39;t consume mind-space making me think that I need something more to do.</p><p>inbox many!</p>
