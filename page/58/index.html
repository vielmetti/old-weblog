<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Here, I should disclose an interest. I worked at Reuters for almost a decade. To my knowledge I was the last - or, as journalists prefer to say, one of the last - Reuters correspondents to file a dispatch by carrier pigeon. That was some years ago (or, as journalists prefer not to say, many years ago) and the birds that flew my dispatches in Zimbabwe&#039;s Matabeleland revived the means of pretechnological communication first used by Reuters in the mid-19th century.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">In a phone conversation this morning, Kramer described the project as “an effort to move beyond banner ads,” which have proven lucrative for the site, but also limited. MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota. (That’s one reason the CPM is so good.) As a result, the site had several weeks this spring when marketers’ demand for advertising space exceeded the site’s supply of local readership.</div>

The great thing is technology allows us to have a virtual meeting online. Arm journalists with laptops, webcams and phones and call the editorial meeting wherever and whenever they are. Too long have journalists been removed from the people they serve. (If not in reality, at least in the minds and attitudes of our community members.)</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">But the point, I hope, is clear.
The old means of control don’t work.
The old categories don’t work.
The old ways of thinking won’t work.
We all need to come to terms with that.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the old media won’t control news dissemination in the future. And organisations can’t control access using old forms of accreditation any more.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Encountered last week-end in Venice, Los Angeles. Still about press, I am fascinated by foreign press available as these A3 sheets of papers sold straight from the printer. Far from the complex e-paper technology, these very low-cost one-sided magazines show an interesting trend about the importance of physical artifacts. Besides, the name of this service (”paper direct”) is conspicuously relevant in these times of frenetic digitalization. Given that it’s printed locally, it’s an up-to-date instantiation (that prevent you from waiting two or three days to have the same newspaper coming from the guts of an Airbus/Boeing Cargo flight).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a story plays out across the Network, as new information is uncovered, the inputs are routed through the mixing board of the writer’s keyboard. A writer must now listen to how the whole jam is sounding— the writer is a player down in the groove with other players. As we learn to write through a real-time medium, we’ll need to look to the values, standards and practices of live performance. But these performances aren’t necessarily the traditional one-to-many events unfolding within a proscenium. We’ll need to dig into the performance theories of Richard Schechner and the Happenings of Allan Kaprow; revive the thoughts of Michael Kirby and The Art of Time, and the work of Fluxus. The journey from text on a page to hypertext on the Network is not a small adjustment to a business model; it’s a transvaluation of all values.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Localism ain’t it, unless it undergoes a total transformation of focus away from trying to sell real estate.  The Local ain’t it, unless it too undergoes a transformation and embraces the community on which it is reporting — and in fact, actually does some, you know, reporting.  The answer may be in social media, like MaplewoodOnline and Baristanet, as more and more journalists leave the newspaper business (by choice or not) and end up having to learn whole new skills in web-based, local, community-powered media.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Crisis communications used to be the handled exclusively through official channels like press releases, spokespeople and media relations. But today, through the power of socially distributed problem-solving, a first draft of history more nuanced and accurate than ever before is emerging from social media, and increasingly, people are turning to unofficial sources first, particularly in times of crisis.</p>

<p>In this episode, social media crisis communications researcher at the ConnectivIT Lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder Leysia Palen shares what she has learned about social media usage during a crisis, assessing the credibility of citizen journalism and user generated media during a crisis, and how organizations might align with unofficial back channels in the future.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Once people could no longer pick up the local gazette and find out who was visiting from California and when Helen Carter was going to sell her famous peach pies, the papers became less relevant to their lives.</p>

<p>Without that relevancy, society and democracy suffered. People became not only less informed, but less involved in their communities.</p>

<p>Consider that 57 percent of Americans say that if their local newspaper went away, both online and in print, they wouldn&#039;t miss it and it wouldn&#039;t hurt the civic life of their towns. The numbers are just as dismal when the question is isolated just to regular newspaper readers. This is in keeping with an earlier Harris poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans say their local newspaper doesn&#039;t serve its community well.</div><br />

      <p>Of course it isn&#39;t Wednesday yet, but I&#39;ll be a day early.</p><p>One of the things I&#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&#39;t exist yet.&#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen.</p><p>Every so often people do edit this page - but often they don&#39;t.&#0160; </p><p>A reasonable goal is to try to minimize the number of times people get frustrated, so one way to track that is to look at the fraction of pages over time where people hit a blank page and try to minimize that.&#0160; Looking at it over the last 3 months it appears that 3.2% of page views go to a page that doesn&#39;t exist yet - if you do a &quot;Top Content&quot; report, and then filter for the string &quot;redlink&quot;, you&#39;ll get what you want.<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 5" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-800wi" title="Picture 5" /></a> </p><p>One way to do continuous improvement, then, is to run a simple report for the pages on any given day, and look through them for ones where people clicked and didn&#39;t find anything.&#0160; Go to those wanted pages and search until you can put in something at least minimal for them.</p><p>Today&#39;s crop of such pages includes the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann%20Arbor%20Wine%20Club">Ann Arbor Wine Club</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Edward%20Burger">Edward Burger</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michael%20R.%20Reid">Michael R.

                <div class="delicious-extended">For a lot of products, such as alarm clocks, you’re only going to write a review if you have a negative experience. How does Amazon get people to write reviews? Most people don’t leave reviews. About 0.7% of people who buy something leave a review. But because Amazon has such a huge amount of customers, that equates to quite a lot. So the next time someone says, &quot;we should have reviews; that works really well for Amazon,&quot; you can respond with &quot;sure, we should have customers too; that works really well for Amazon.&quot;</div>

The book describes the “sugaring off” parties in Vermont, where people hosted neighborhood celebrations as they finished off the annual tapping of sap from trees for maple syrup. It describes the making of persimmon beer among Mississippi African-Americans. In and around Darlington, South Carolina, people would host outdoor gatherings and serve “chicken bog,” a distinctive chicken-and-rice dish. Nebraskans loved buffalo barbeque and Wisconsin folks enjoyed sour-dough pancakes.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Also, although John spends more time and slightly more emphasis on comments directed towards ‘curmudgeons’, I would say that the abuse that he saw hurled toward Jessica da Silva by veteran journalists isn’t isolated to comments on blogs. The commenter Robert Knilands (aka Wenalway) may seem your run-of-the-mill troll, but he expresses a virulent form of prejudice too frequently directed towards online and young journalists by some - and I stress, only some - print journalists. Robert Knilands says:</p>

      </h3>
      <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.</p>

<p>It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all.</p>

<br />Saturday June 27, 2009: 10:00 am to 11:30 am -- <br />Downtown Library:
Multi-Purpose Room
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Bring your camera and explore Ann Arbor! Photowalk is a fun way to
capture photos of the beauty of Ann Arbor and then post them online
for all to see. Our first Photowalk is held in conjunction with the
Library’s summer reading program, Local Motion - which encourages the
use of local neighborhoods, gyms, recreational facilities and outdoor
areas to explore Ann Arbor and get fit. We will begin with
presentations by several local photography experts, including: Myra
Klarman, professional photographer specializing in studio and
lifestyle portraits, Michael C. Myers, local photographer and a
founding member of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and Leisa
Thompson, Ann Arbor News Staff Photographer. Following the lecture, at
11:30 am, we will go out in small groups to photograph Ann Arbor. The
results will be an online exhibit of your photos in the aadl.org
pictureAnnArbor collection.

            &lt;div class=&quot;delicious-extended&quot;&gt;Newspapers have more important things to do than worry about comments—like, say, report the stories that blogs so desperately need in their 24-7 quest for content! After all, blogs are often not equipped to regularly break the news, and we need content to chew on.
</code></pre>

<p>As Arthur Sulzberger&#039;s relation Benjamin Dolnick lamented in the comments section of Carr&#039;s NYT story (noticed by Choire Sicha at Radar): &quot;If you ever want to lose faith in humanity, read any comments section on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. Also, nobody wants to hear the tired old &quot;free speech&quot; argument as a defense of comments. We&#039;ve had free speech in this country for well over two hundred years, long before it was ever an option to comment on newspaper websites and blogs.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Brown agreed that reader comments are a &quot;really significant&quot; development in online journalism.</p>

<p>&quot;You could have a situation where you put up a story … and this amazing thing happens where people start taking your story apart, going through the facts — doing all sorts of background and fact-checking — better than any editor can do, because you&#039;ve got this crowd-source effort to go through every line of it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;At worst, it can be like YouTube&#039;s comment section where it&#039;s sort of like a bathroom in a subway station with all sorts of comments on the wall. Everybody&#039;s completely anonymous. No one has any sense of their reputation within that community, everyone&#039;s a troll.&quot;</div><br />

No one with that authority stepped in to admonish the rude, correct those who posted wrong information, or to respond to those who had questions about the story.

                <div class="delicious-extended">This issue came up on the Online-News discussion list this week, so I know many newspapers are struggling with comment management at the moment. It also came to a head this week in Batavia, where the Daily News was hit by a particularly ugly comment thread in which a socket puppet attacked fellow elected officials, one politician is posing as a defender of said politician, and a community activist brought to light unfounded allegations against a city councilman (I won&#039;t dignify the charge by repeating it here, and because I know these people, it&#039;s pretty easy to figure out who&#039;s who).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;I&#039;ve also seen a noticeable change in tone in comments and other interactive forums, like Coveritlive.com. As soon as someone from the paper steps in and makes a comment, the whole tone changes. If you just give people a blank wall and a spray paint can, you get a predictable outcome. But as soon as anyone says we should stick to the topic or knock off the personal attacks, it has a noticeable effect.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s some reports from around the state of the strawberry crop.&#0160; (We&#39;re planning a trip to Rowe&#39;s in Rawsonville for Father&#39;s Day).</p><p><a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45468">From the Detroit Free Press via FreshPlaza:</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">At DeGroot&#39;s Strawberries in Gregory, 16 acres of lush plants are close to ripening.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s
not too hot and could be a little warmer,&quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who
with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &quot;But
the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket
for the plants.&quot;<br /><br />Pick-your-own strawberries will be $1.20 a
pound at DeGroot&#39;s this year. Whittaker&#39;s strawberries sell for $1.25 a
pound. And at Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Ypsilanti, the cost is $1.46 per
pound, up 3 cents from last year.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45470">From mlive.com again via FreshPlaza</a> on the season in mid-Michigan:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Geri R. Hingston and her husband, James H. Hingston, own Hingstons
Country, 18670 Dice in Merrill, a 4-acre you-pick farm with
strawberries and other produce.<br /><br />Customers usually begin
harvesting the fruit about June 14, but she said she probably will
delay by five or more days because of cooler weather, frost warnings
and bees not coming out to pollinate.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/528487.html">A June 8 story in the Marquette Mining Journal (via the Escanaba Press) about UP strawberries:</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;There were also a few days where overnight lows dropped close to
the freezing mark at the Delta County Airport, however, it is possible
inland areas did drop to or below freezing,&quot; said Fleegel.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">A call by the Daily Press to Victor Ledvina, owner of Ledvina&#39;s Strawberry Farm in Flat Rock was unsuccessful.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">There was also no indication of when picking would begin at Ledvina&#39;s Strawberry Farm.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Dave
Pellegrini, operator of Pellegrini&#39;s Strawberry Farm said they had been
irrigating five out of the past eight nights to prevent the fragile
blossoms from frosting over.</p><p><br /><br /><p></p>The full moon in June is called the strawberry moon; it was on June 7.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.</p><p>The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.</p><p>UPDATE: Two Ann Arbor News stories by Judy McGovern:</p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/some_question_appropriateness.html">Some question appropriateness of mocking e-mail banter during Ann Arbor City Council meetings</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Sent from city e-mail accounts, the messages were released by the city
in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Great Lakes
Environmental Law Center.
</div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The Detroit-based law center was seeking communication about the
city&#39;s planned underground parking structure on Fifth Avenue. What it
got, in addition, were a series of live e-mail exchanges among council
members during three meetings in February and March.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Some
of the messages discuss business on the council&#39;s agenda - such as
whether a vote will be postponed - but more often they spoofed the
proceedings.
<br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/not_all_ann_arbor_city_council.html">Not all Ann Arbor City Council meeting e-mails were horseplay</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition to quietly poking fun at individuals and groups before
them, some Ann Arbor City Council members apparently used their city
e-mail accounts during meetings to discreetly discuss city business.<br /></div><p>I don&#39;t know who all has sent in FOIA requests yet, or what will be printed - the best guess I have at this point is that something will show up in the Sunday paper.&#0160; I&#39;ve seen copies of what is evidently a very selectively edited set of messages from one meeting, in which one member of council sends email to most but not all members of council, awarding a &quot;golden vomit award&quot; to a council member not included on the email.&#0160; Is that teasing, ridicule, or an effort to influence future voting?&#0160; Hard to say.</p><p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act is not clear on the status of email communications as meetings.&#0160; An article in the <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/michigan/open-meetings-laws-michigan">Citizen Media Law Project</a> site says</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
Governmental bodies may hold meetings by by written, telephonic,
electronic, wireless, or other virtual means. However, an electronic
meeting is still subject to the notice requirements and must be held at
a designated place and time. While the law is not certain on this
point, it appears that email communications between members of a
governmental body may constitute a meeting if they involve deliberation
on public business.
</p><p>There&#39;s Open Meetings Act litigation underway in Texas, where the questions of balancing First Amendment rights to speech threaten to change laws across the country.&#0160; I don&#39;t understand all the repercussions, but here&#39;s the story from the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/05/17/0517speech.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> paper:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">It started as a minor prosecution of two Alpine City Council members
accused of discussing city business in private e-mails and not, as
Texas law requires, in a public forum. </p> 
        

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, with a recent U.S. appeals court ruling, the 2004 incident is
mushrooming into a national issue — bringing denunciations from
open-government advocates who fear the decision will cripple laws that
ban elected officials from conducting public business behind closed
doors. </p> 
        

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The controversy surrounds a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
that the Texas Open Meetings Act compromised the Alpine council
members&#39; free speech rights and may have to be overturned or rewritten. </p><p><a href="http://www.bigbendsentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1714&amp;Itemid=1">The Big Bend Sentinel, the local paper for Alpine, TX, notes that this case may reach the Supreme Court</a> based on the intervention of attorney generals from multiple states.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">ALPINE – The recent federal appeals court ruling
in an Alpine Texas Open Meetings Act case that a public official’s
right to free speech is the same as a private citizens may eventually
find its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, an attorney in
the matter said this week.<br /><br />
“Nineteen states have weighed in saying it (the ruling) could change
their open meetings laws,” Alpine attorney Rod Ponton said. “That makes
it a national issue that would need to be decided by the Supreme Court.”<br /> <br />
On April 24, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, Louisiana, reversed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Rob Junell, who initially heard the civil lawsuit
brought by former Alpine City Council members Dr. Avinash Rangra and
Anna Monclova.</p><p>As I noted I expect more on this issue in the Sunday June 7 2009 news.</p>
