<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

                <div class="delicious-extended">What began as a crazy idea among police friends is quickly becoming an international phenomenon. There is a doughnut shop and bakery in Clare, Michigan that has been in constant operation since 1896. This foundation business was within weeks of closing when the members of the Clare Police Department came to the rescue. All of them. That&#039;s right, all nine members of the local police department banded together to save this historic business. Dubbed &quot;Cops and Doughnuts,&quot; the business boasts handmade confections of all types. Join us for a warm fresh doughnut and a steaming cup of coffee while you enjoy the police decor and friendly, and very safe, atmosphere. Come and see the new store in Clare that everyone is talking about.</div>

It&#039;s a big loss for Lions coverage, and it&#039;s troubling to see good reporters (Danny Knobler, Jon Paul Morosi) move on.  Detroit sports fans are losing out.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Every project I’ve worked on in the last two years has heavily involved the use of web APIs. Libersy at the time (no idea about now) had an architecture that was extensively API based, even for communication between internal applications (an architecture I strongly argued against, bee tea dubs). Since then I’ve futzed with web APIs almost exclusively. From very narrow focused uses like University of Michigan’s Bluestream Service, to more broad but still fairly local APIs like the Ann Arbor District Library’s soon-to-be-updated API, all the way to APIs of major web applications like Twitter and Flickr.</div>

Currently, we do this by tagging objects of interest with an RFID reader, and providing an RFID reader and computer to read the tags. Unlike ordinary RFID readers, the TalkingPoints reader speaks the information conveyed by the tag to the user.</div>

Rebecca Konieczny, owner of the Busy Hands yarn and gift store, said she’d gotten so mad that she followed him up and down Main Street, calling the police from her cell phone. Someone else suggested that perhaps merchants start carrying mace and pepper spray, to which Martelle responded: “I can’t condone the use of mace on the homeless population.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Only one thing may put lard back on the slippery slope: Google the word as news, and it might as well be lard-fearing 1969 all over again. Newspaper food pages still routinely advise using olive or canola oils rather than &quot;fattening&quot; or &quot;artery-clogging&quot; lard. Or they print idiotic utterances like &quot;you get all the lard you need at McDonald&#039;s&quot; (a chain that actually abandoned beef tallow for frying its fries only to be saddled with a trans-fatty substitute). Occasionally an article will make a valid point—lard is still anathema to vegetarians and halal observers—but more often there will be surprise that lard does not taste anything like pig.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a buddy of mine always says &quot;the nice thing about standards is that there&#039;s so many to choose from&quot;. Take CSV files for example. CSV, of course, stands for &quot;Comma Separated Values&quot;, more often than not though, it seems that CSV files use tabs to separate values rather than commas. And let&#039;s not even mention field quoting. If you deal with CSV files and you use Python the csv module can make your life a bit easier.</div>

      </h3>
      <p>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process.</p><p>Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.</p><p>In some sense that&#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &quot;law of two feet&quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people.&#0160; I had a great time but the dynamic was odd enough that I want to try to get to a 100pm stop time again instead of 130pm.&#0160; So here&#39;s some suggestions that came in from that.</p><p>1.&#0160; Bring introductions down to the completely minimal.&#0160; I&#39;ve been in circles where the entire intro was full name plus three more words, nothing more, and the intros go around the table at something like two or three per minute.&#0160; If you have to condense your identity into three words you have to think hard, or be funny.</p><p>2.&#0160; Reach a larger audience in more smaller venues.&#0160; Promote a set of places to meet at the same time, and let people pick which of many places they want to show up; synchronize and coordinate so that someone organizes at each location at the same time.&#0160; </p><p>3.&#0160; Use some kind of token - like boarding passes a la Southwest - to hand out to people so that you know how many people are there and which order you handed them out in.&#0160; Use that both to plan how many seconds you have for each intro and to provide an order to things.</p><p>4.&#0160; Get inspired by events like <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> and hold a rock paper scissors tournament to winnow out the crowd down to a reasonable size; only the last four or eight people standing get to say who they are, and they get more time to talk.</p><p>5.&#0160; Don&#39;t let people introduce themselves; rather, the host introduces everyone.</p><p>6.&#0160; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24441.html">Inspired by the Washington Post,</a> host an exclusive event and charge a lot of money for access to &quot;those powerful few&quot;.&#0160; </p><p>7.&#0160; Don&#39;t worry about it; it will work itself out somehow with something someone suggests on the spot.</p>

<p>The astonishing offer was detailed in a flier circulated Wednesday to a health care lobbyist, who provided it to a reporter because the lobbyist said he felt it was a conflict for the paper to charge for access to, as the flier says, its “health care reporting and editorial staff.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Vandaag stond Ann Arbor op het programma, een charmant universiteitsstadje dat in gotische stijl is opgetrokken. Alweer geïnspireerd door de Engelse universiteiten, natuurlijk. Goed afkijken, is ook een kunst. In Amerika zijn ze trouwens ook dol op de Griekse en Romeinse bouwstijlen. Als ze ergens een zuil kunnen tussen wringen, zullen ze het zeker niet laten. Zelfs moderne gebouwen worden met klassieke zuilen versierd. Bij mij roepen al die zuilen eerder een gevoel van slechte imitatie op.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a complete list of where all of the Amelanchier (juneberry, shadbush, sugar plum depending on where you are from) trees are on the public streets in Ann Arbor.&#0160; The complete inventory shows 356 trees, each geocoded; rather than try to pin them on a map, this is by street name in alphabetical order, with quite a bit of duplicates eliminated.</p>
<p>The whole program to do this is</p>
<p>grep -i Amelanchier trees09.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3, &quot;between&quot;, $4, &quot;and &quot; $5}&#39; | sort | uniq &gt; juneberry.txt</p>
<p>where the trees09.csv file is downloadable from the Ann Arbor Chronicle who originally sourced this data from the city of Ann Arbor; <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/07/01/city-and-residents-to-make-tree-policy/">see their story about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Alas this post is a little bit too late for this season; by July 2, 2009, many of the juneberry trees are completely ripe, so get picking.</p>

Most every community that I contribute to offers a comprehensive user profile/history page, letting members customize to their hearts content and allow their profile to reflect their personality. When I think of mainstream news, TV, and newspaper sites trying to solicit comments from readers, I&#039;ve yet to find something close to even a basic community site. The New York Times requires me to register to read most stories, but their blog system gives me a blank generic comment form when I want to comment on a blog post.</div>

      </h3>
      <p>day 3 notes</p><p>I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.</p><p>In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89.1 WEMU FM; and Dave Gershman from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; Some part of the DDA meeting was also recorded by video cameras; I haven&#39;t figured out yet how to replay that.</p><p>It&#39;s instructive to see the different viewpoints that these three media channels provide, and to figure out what added perspective you could get from it.</p><p>Dave Askins was twittering out notes on <a href="http://twitter.com/A2ChronicleMeet">@A2ChronicleMeet</a> with a running play by play.&#0160; I&#39;m certain that it will be part of the raw materials for a long, descriptive, detailed account of the meeting, complete with bits of reflection on logos on garbage cans and the ins and outs of what roles and responsibilities flow to the mayor pro tem.&#0160; Dave gave a great talk at <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> 1 the previous night about how the extremely descriptive style of news that the Chronicle publishes serves them well in reviewing things long after the fact, even if wading through 7000 words seems like a bit long for right now in a world where reporters are used to publishing 500 or 1000.</p><p>Andrew Cluely from WEMU was in the back taking a few notes, and he had his recorder out front at the end of the meeting with one of the board members.&#0160; I looked online really hard for where the story might have been posted already, and came up at best with <a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wemu/news.newsmain?action=search&amp;advanced=true&amp;newSearch=true&amp;searchOption=1&amp;TEASE_WORDS=cluley&amp;BYLINE_WORDS=&amp;Submit=Search">this page where it might be</a>, buried deep on a search string.&#0160; There&#39;s some wasted opportunity here, since the same-day audio clip is going to give you a perspective on decisions later - if, and only if, you can find it again.</p><p>Dave Gershman filed two stories from the Ann Arbor News - one on how the DDA&#39;s <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/downtown_ann_arbor_mural_plan.html">decision on public arts funding impacts the murals proposed by Fire Up Downtown</a>, and one on how <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/ann_arbor_expects_federal_prog.html">federal stimulus money will save $1.5 million in financing costs for the Library Lot underground garage</a>.&#0160; The mural story attracted MLive&#39;s usual crowd of incredibly lame, rude, and anonymous commenters - people who didn&#39;t add any value to the story.</p><p>Now I know that there were a lot more stories to be told out of that event - the continuing saga of somewhat confused people figuring out how e-Park meters work, the continuing series of anecdotes about how the Maynard St structure is always full without any supporting data or analysis, and the parliamentary maneuvers about whether Leigh Greden should be able to vote in the seat reserved for the mayor as mayor pro tem.&#0160; </p><p>Where do you start with news?&#0160; Small town politics of parking meters.&#0160; I&#39;m told that new employees at the New York Times and returning international correspondents once worked the sanitation beat as their first stint (and I can&#39;t source that quote, even though I&#39;d like to, because I didn&#39;t bookmark that link).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Another part of day 3 -</p><p>We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript.&#0160; Microsoft Word is one version of that process; there&#39;s lots more paths that get there.</p><p>I know that when I used to use Typepad, that the rich text editor I had was pretty good about stripping out tags and attributes that were weird.&#0160; Font tags disappeared, for instance, which made it possible to be sure that stuff didn&#39;t show up as Comic Sans unless I really wanted them to be in Comic Sans.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found out so far.</p><p><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/developer/rich-text-editors.html">MT supports multiple kinds of rich text editor abstractions.</a>&#0160; There&#39;s currently support for the YUI editor, for TinyMCE, and for FCK.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The relevant bit of configuration code is wrapped in<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <code>&lt;mt:setvarblock name=&quot;editor_content&quot;&gt;</code></p><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tinymce-mtplugin/">TinyMCE MT plugin source</a> posted on Google Code.&#0160; The current release, supporting Japanese and English, is in active development and is at version 0.1.11 as of 29 hours ago.</p><p>Richard Benson wrote and supports the <a href="http://www.richardbenson.co.uk/projects/yui-rich-text-editor-in-movabl.html?utm_source=mt-plugins&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=yui-editor">YUI MT plugin</a>, which is at version 1.3.</p><p>Now, to the actual MT rich text editor:</p><p>A rant from<a accesskey="1" href="http://padawan.info/en/2007/07/upgrading-to-mt.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>François Nonnenmacher</a> about the HTML generated by the MT rich text editor:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>The Rich Text Editor produces tons of ugly fucking code behind the screen</strong>, especially when using Safari. So it&#39;s an <a href="http://padawan.info/web/oldschool_rich_text_editors.html">old-school editor</a> such <a href="http://padawan.info/web/midas.html">Midas</a>, only a slight improvement over <abbr title="What You See Is Fucking Ugly Code">WYSIFUC</abbr> in the sense that it hides it from you (unless you select &quot;none&quot; in the Format menu or &quot;HTML Mode&quot; and scream in horror at the <abbr title="Fucking Ugly Code">FUC</abbr>
it generates, like &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style:
italic;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;!). For
example, on Safari it generates a DIV per paragraph, while on Firefox
it just spits out &lt;br&gt; tags or cosmetic &lt;i&gt; or &lt;b&gt;
tags (not even &lt;br /&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; tags, mind
you).<br /></div><p><br />And generally that&#39;s my experience to date; weird tags, bad semantics, and unpredictable behavior.&#0160; What I don&#39;t know yet (and hope to figure out) is what the data path is through the system that would let things be cleaned up and filtered on the back end so that they are consistent, or fixed on the front end so that the generated code from the rich text editor is better.</p><p>The funny thing is, this used to work better: old versions of Typepad, and old versions of MT, both had a very conservative rich text editor that denatured the text quite a bit, removing a lot of tags and operating in &quot;safe mode&quot; much more so than &quot;rich mode&quot;.</p><p>a puzzle...</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Cowell doesn’t mention that the advertising is the most important part of the financial equation in paying for journalism, not the cover price. It has been so for as long as he’s been a journalist. The word “Advertise” appears three times on this Web page (and “Advertisements” once), but not in Cowell’s column.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Froomkin acknowledges the drop but told me much of it can be blamed on a change in format and poor promotion. He said that shifting White House Watch from a column to a blog when Obama took office was disruptive to his audience and &quot;dramatically reduced the number of page views per reader.” He also said poor promotion, especially through links from the home page, had caused traffic to dip. “I felt that with adequate promotion, page views would have been much higher,” he said.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Here, I should disclose an interest. I worked at Reuters for almost a decade. To my knowledge I was the last - or, as journalists prefer to say, one of the last - Reuters correspondents to file a dispatch by carrier pigeon. That was some years ago (or, as journalists prefer not to say, many years ago) and the birds that flew my dispatches in Zimbabwe&#039;s Matabeleland revived the means of pretechnological communication first used by Reuters in the mid-19th century.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">If this sounds highfalutin’, let me offer a personal counterpoint.

                <div class="delicious-extended">In a phone conversation this morning, Kramer described the project as “an effort to move beyond banner ads,” which have proven lucrative for the site, but also limited. MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota. (That’s one reason the CPM is so good.) As a result, the site had several weeks this spring when marketers’ demand for advertising space exceeded the site’s supply of local readership.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">would rather the journalists who work for me walk the dog and talk to their neighbors or hit their neighborhood coffee house, or head straight to court/city hall to see what&#039;s happening rather than come in and cruise the wires and local newspapers.
The great thing is technology allows us to have a virtual meeting online. Arm journalists with laptops, webcams and phones and call the editorial meeting wherever and whenever they are. Too long have journalists been removed from the people they serve. (If not in reality, at least in the minds and attitudes of our community members.)</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">But the point, I hope, is clear.
The old means of control don’t work.
The old categories don’t work.
The old ways of thinking won’t work.
We all need to come to terms with that.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the old media won’t control news dissemination in the future. And organisations can’t control access using old forms of accreditation any more.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Encountered last week-end in Venice, Los Angeles. Still about press, I am fascinated by foreign press available as these A3 sheets of papers sold straight from the printer. Far from the complex e-paper technology, these very low-cost one-sided magazines show an interesting trend about the importance of physical artifacts. Besides, the name of this service (”paper direct”) is conspicuously relevant in these times of frenetic digitalization. Given that it’s printed locally, it’s an up-to-date instantiation (that prevent you from waiting two or three days to have the same newspaper coming from the guts of an Airbus/Boeing Cargo flight).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a story plays out across the Network, as new information is uncovered, the inputs are routed through the mixing board of the writer’s keyboard. A writer must now listen to how the whole jam is sounding— the writer is a player down in the groove with other players. As we learn to write through a real-time medium, we’ll need to look to the values, standards and practices of live performance. But these performances aren’t necessarily the traditional one-to-many events unfolding within a proscenium. We’ll need to dig into the performance theories of Richard Schechner and the Happenings of Allan Kaprow; revive the thoughts of Michael Kirby and The Art of Time, and the work of Fluxus. The journey from text on a page to hypertext on the Network is not a small adjustment to a business model; it’s a transvaluation of all values.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Localism ain’t it, unless it undergoes a total transformation of focus away from trying to sell real estate.  The Local ain’t it, unless it too undergoes a transformation and embraces the community on which it is reporting — and in fact, actually does some, you know, reporting.  The answer may be in social media, like MaplewoodOnline and Baristanet, as more and more journalists leave the newspaper business (by choice or not) and end up having to learn whole new skills in web-based, local, community-powered media.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Crisis communications used to be the handled exclusively through official channels like press releases, spokespeople and media relations. But today, through the power of socially distributed problem-solving, a first draft of history more nuanced and accurate than ever before is emerging from social media, and increasingly, people are turning to unofficial sources first, particularly in times of crisis.</p>

<p>In this episode, social media crisis communications researcher at the ConnectivIT Lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder Leysia Palen shares what she has learned about social media usage during a crisis, assessing the credibility of citizen journalism and user generated media during a crisis, and how organizations might align with unofficial back channels in the future.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Once people could no longer pick up the local gazette and find out who was visiting from California and when Helen Carter was going to sell her famous peach pies, the papers became less relevant to their lives.</p>

<p>Without that relevancy, society and democracy suffered. People became not only less informed, but less involved in their communities.</p>

<p>Consider that 57 percent of Americans say that if their local newspaper went away, both online and in print, they wouldn&#039;t miss it and it wouldn&#039;t hurt the civic life of their towns. The numbers are just as dismal when the question is isolated just to regular newspaper readers. This is in keeping with an earlier Harris poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans say their local newspaper doesn&#039;t serve its community well.</div><br />

<p>While we bemoaned shovelware (taking the same exact print story and repurposing it for the Web), we took little time to really examine what might might be different about online publishing that should change the way news is gathered and presented.</div><br />

New Orleans, where a transparent recovery and historic preservation are
daily uphill battles, this tool can be invaluable in saving and sharing
ancient and new maps of the city’s original development and
re-development since Hurricane Katrina and The Flood.&#0160; The following
shows how, in under ten minutes, I georectified an 1895 map of the
French Quarter and Garden District of New Orleans and exported it to
Google Maps.</p><p>Worth a look, especially if the bits of history you have collected include maps that don&#39;t quite line up with the current street maps.</p><p></p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">I thought I’d take some time this week to mention a couple of new sites built with MT. First, MovableType.com has a story about The San Francisco Appeal, an online newspaper dedicated to local SF news. Somewhat similar, ChicagoNow is a collection of blogs providing news and information about Chicago neighborhoods. Owned by Tribune Media and developed by Byrne Reese, ChicagoNow is a community site for all of Chicago. Soon, they will be rolling out Motion-based functionality.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Editor &amp; Publisher recently remarked about the difficulty in maintaining and moderating user comments:</p>

<p>    ..traffic volume has made it difficult for any but the wealthiest media operations to monitor user comments as diligently as they do letters to the editor or “talk backs” to news directors. The combination of virtually open access and limited oversight has turned these public squares into mosh pits, without the latter&#039;s youthful exuberance or bonhomie.</p>

<p>Trying to adhere to policies that work to keep rules in place without disrupting or silencing the passionate voices of their readers have challenged media operators. Yet, many news media have taken steps in striking a balance between quality and quantity.</div><br />
