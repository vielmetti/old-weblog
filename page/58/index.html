<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

computing-in-the-bad-weather, talking about rolling out VPNs to

go! Sometimes life doesn’t need to be so complex.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://old.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/articles/papers/247.pdf">Dr. Richard Snow writes about fault tolerance in railway scheduling (PDF):</a></p><div class="snap_preview">

rates, measured by weighing snow blown into a filter fabric trap, were
greater over hard snow or ice than for the same wind speed over soft,
fresh snow surfaces. Analysis of wind speed profiles from nine
blizzards showed that friction between moving particles and the surface
was less, and particle speeds were greater over hard surfaces.
Transport rates at a given wind speed increased rapidly as aerodynamic
roughness decreased in the rough-smooth transition region. Bagnold&#39;s
theory for bed load transport provided a useful framework for the
analysis.</div><p><br />So, what we have includes modeling systems when there is inclement weather, modeling the transport of fine particles during inclement weather, and building simulators that are computer controlled to let you see how things work.&#0160; All fun ideas.</p><p><a href="http://www.pasty.com/heikki/heikkilunta.html">(More info at pasty.com)</a></p>

<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup all-purpose flour</div>
<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup milk </div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt</div>
<div>2 medium baking apples, peeled and thinly sliced&#0160; (I used Braeburn apples)</div>
<div>3 Tbs sugar</div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp ceylon cinnamon</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Preheat oven to 400.&#0160; divide butter between two 9&quot; pie plates and
put them in the oven to melt the butter.&#0160; Rotate to be sure that butter
covers bottom and&#0160; sides of pans.&#0160; Use a 4 cup measuring cup as a
mixing bowl (makes it easy to divide the batter).&#0160; Beat eggs, flour,
milk and salt on medium speed for 1 minute.&#0160; Divide the apple slices
between the pans and pour <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the egg mixture over each pan.&#0160; Mix
the cinnamin and sugar and sprinkle over the batter.&#0160; Bake until puffed
and folden brown&#0160; 20-25 minutes.&#0160; Serve right away, while still puffy,
with warm syrup.&#0160; </div></p>

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Serves 4-6&#0160;&#0160; Prep time 10 minutes, baking time&#0160; 20-25 minutes. <br /><br />and the report from up north from March 18, 2009:<br /></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Over the weekend we put 28 taps in our maple sugar trees.&#0160;&#0160; We
collected 8 gallons the first day but the next two nights were not
below freezing.&#0160; We have only 17 gallons so far.&#0160; It was cold last
night so the sap should run today.&#0160; Snowshoes are very necessary as the
<span class="il">snow</span> is &quot;punky&quot;.&#0160; Even with snowshoes we
sometimes break through the crust and one leg goes down 1 foot...makes
for slow going.&#0160; Hopefully we have a good wide track packed now.&#0160; </div>

It just rolled out April 1st. Our area associations, I imagine, are
going to want to embed this&ndash;and we encourage them to&ndash;in their own
webpages. For instance, Main Street Area Association, and State Street
Area Association. There are a lot of them, these associations and other

THE STORY OF MAD-STONE<br />
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]<br />
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all<br />
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,<br />
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison.<br />
This stone has something of a history. In 1848 Captain Wilson, of<br />
Alabama, killed a white deer in Talladega County, and search was made<br />
in the stomach for a stone. One was found a little larger than a<br />
goose-egg, with a flat surface on one side It resembled a petrified<br />
sponge. The stone up to this time has been used in upward of one<br />
thousand cases. Captain Wilson gave the stone to Mr. Cowan, who lives<br />
near Handley, in this county. Mr. Cowan, as a token of great<br />
friendship, gave the stone to W. R. Sanner, who would part with it for<br />
no amount. The philosophy of the operation of the stone and the reason<br />
it is found in the stomach of the white deer is given by the Indians<br />
as follows: &quot;The white deer is more susceptible to vegetable poisons<br />
taken into the stomach when eaten with grass. To preserve the life of<br />
the animal, nature has placed in the stomach this porous stone, which<br />
at once absorbs the poison, neutralizes it, and saves the deer&#39;s life.<br />
The stone applied to a bit into which poison has been injected at once<br />
draws it out, and when its pores are filled drops off; being soaked in<br />
milk the stone is made pure again and ready for another application.&quot;</p>

with retailers. Rapundalo asked Bryan Weinert, the solid-waste

efforts. Weinert said that on March 22-23 staff would be meeting with
retailers to get feedback on the already-drafted ordinance. He said
there would be information on city’s website and a public information
survey, acknowledging that there was some controversy surrounding the
issue.&#0160; Weinert said that based on feedback from the public and
merchants, staff would bring forward a recommendation. Weinert did not
state what the range of possibilities for such a recommendation would

Statistics show that 10% to 15% of the parking spaces in garages are not used, even when the garage appears full. In a parking structure such as Century City with 2,500 spaces, that means that at any given time, the garage could “appear” full, but it would have 200 to 400 spaces available. “You just couldn’t find them, at least not easily,” deWildt says. “It’s like we had built a 400-space garage.”

A salesman for himself and his vision of the American dream, he was also a master peddler of many products, whose makers were as loyal to Harvey as his listeners. A skit from the 1984-85 season of Saturday Night Live had Harvey (played by Rich Hall) compulsively peppering his news items with sponsor names. The man remained unapologetic. "Some days," he told Larry King in 1988, "the best news in the broadcast is the commercial. You can keep your natural teeth all your natural life! There is a glove that doesn't wear out! There is a car battery that keeps its promises! That's good news! And I would use those things on the air if they were not in the body of the commercial."

CertifiChecks is based in Dayton, Ohio; here&#39;s what the <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/business/2009/02/27/ddn022709certifichecksweb.html">news report from writer Ben Sutherly in Dayton</a> says:
</p><blockquote><p>
The company said it has halted gift certificate sales and its administration of gift certificate programs, effective Thursday, Feb. 26.

The company said it is filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in Dayton.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A 2002 story in the <a href="http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2002/07/08/daily26.html">Dayton Business Journal</a> gives some sense for their scope of operations:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded in 1999 by Steve Buchholz, serves nearly 40,000 associations, chambers of commerce and mall or shopping centers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
By 2004, when Certifichecks had signed up a network of Christian-owned hotels, they had grown substantially, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2004/10/25/daily5.html">as noted in the Dayton Business Journal</a>:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded locally by Steve Buchholz in 1999, now has about 72,000 restaurant associations, chambers of commerce and bed and breakfast associations as customers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
News is starting to trickle in about the impact of this. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/02/chamber_fumes_as_widespread_gi.html">From Muskegon, MI, Chad Lerch of the Muskegon Chronicle writes in the story Muskegon Chamber fumes as widespread CertifiChecks gift checks bounce</a>


</p><blockquote><p>
MUSKEGON COUNTY -- An Ohio-based company that offers gift checks for retailers abruptly closed Thursday, leaving West Michigan chambers of commerce, merchants and shoppers fuming and searching for answers.


Cindy Larsen, president of the Muskegon Area Chamber of Commerce, said up to $150,000 worth of gift checks for &quot;Muskegon Money&quot; could still be unspent.

If that&#39;s the case, a myriad of shoppers are holding checks that are worthless -- at least for now.

&quot;We&#39;re freaking out,&quot; Larsen said. &quot;We&#39;re freaking out because we&#39;re worried that someone is going to get stuck.&quot;
</p></blockquote><p>More will certainly come out of this story - if Certifichecks really has this many subscribers, gift cards and gift certificates are going to start bouncing all over the country.</p>

<p></ul>
<div>That discussion pointed to this essay by <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/leader.html">Phil Agre on How To Be A Leader In Your Field</a> (2005), aimed at grad students. &#0160;He has a six part recipe (more pointless numbered lists; but you understand that as a grounding principle) on how to do it. &#0160;Starkly abstracted:</div><div><ol>
<li><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times">Pick an issue. You need an issue that the profession as a whole is not really thinking about, but which is going to be the center of attention in five years.&#0160;</p></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Having chosen your issue, start a project to study it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Find relevant people and talk to them. First do your library work so you know any conventional wisdom that&#39;s out there. Then talk to some working professionals who are facing the issue, especially if they have spoken publicly about an aspect of it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Pull together what you&#39;ve heard. Nobody is expecting you to solve the problems.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Circulate the result. Send copies to the people who helped you. Call it a draft or interim report if you want. Give credit to the people whose ideas you&#39;ve written down. Then follow up.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Build on your work. Get invited to speak at meetings. Correspond with people who have contacted you after reading your work.</span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</li>
</ol>
<span>Note that Agre&#39;s list has five steps before the &quot;speak at meetings&quot;, and that Marick&#39;s list only has&#0160;</span>&#0160;two; you can chalk up most of that to the need in grad school to engage in more ritual behavior vs. the practitioner who is just looking to talk about something novel to the people who want to hear something novel.<br /></div><br /><div>&ndash;</div><br /><div>I write about this stuff all the time, because in part I think about the tag line this blog has now (&quot;I am a leader by default, because nature abhors a vacuum&quot;) and how it reflects on the leadership role of seeing something not yet there and working at it until it is real enough for others to take as their own. &#0160;Hard to say that this is an easy path to do - if you are too scatterbrained you have dozens of projects that are not quite full formed and you never get to the expert level - but there is something to be said for the notion that this is something which you or anyone can do by simple application of diligence and leverage in some small gap in the structure of how the world currently is.</div></p>

Never Done begins by describing the household chores of nineteenth-century America: cooking at fireplaces and on cast-iron stoves, laundry done with boilers and flatirons, endless water-hauling and fire-tending, and so on. Strasser goes on to explain and explore how industrialization transformed the nature of women&#39;s work. Easing some tasks and eliminating others, new commercial processes inexorably altered women&#39;s daily lives and relationships—with each other and with those they served.<br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;">There&#39;s some additional line of thinking I&#39;d like to go down - a patent search - here&#39;s some from the 1920s that show up:</div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=VCdhAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=sears+vacuum#PPA3,M1">1699598</a>&#0160;-&#0160;<span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; line-height: 15px; ">Objects of the invention are:—to equalize the pressure of air passing through all points of the air inlet orifice of a vacuum cleaner; 10 to enable a surface to be efficiently cleaned in corners with a minimum of change of position of the machine; to prevent the curling upward of the margins of rugs, loosely laid carpets,&quot;or other fabrics by the suction 15 when a vacuum cleaner is moved across their edges; to simplify the assembling and disassembling of the operating mechanism and otherwise to increase the efficiency, improve the operation and simplify the arrangement 20 of parts of traveling vacuum cleaners.</span></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 15px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><a href="http://www.vdta.com/hof-list.html">aha, much much more from the Vacuum Dealers Trade Association - A Vacuum and Sewing Hall of Fame!.. stopping now.</a></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 15px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;"><br /></span></div></span></p>
