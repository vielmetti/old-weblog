I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.
In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-on-the-media-and-government-watching-the-dda-day-3/">&raquo;</a></p>

We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-movable-type-rich-text-editors-and-stripping-weird-tags/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bob Frankston - Opportunity for Innovation Perhaps the most difficult concept is the need to invert our usual “procurement” model of problem solving – we can’t dictate the solutions but instead need to create (generative) opportunity and then accept the solutions that arise.
We can only dictate solutions for the short term but we’re rewarded for short term thinking. This makes it doubly difficult to “sell” the idea that we need to create opportunity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-links-for-2009-07-01/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mediactive » What Pays for Newspaper Journalism? Not the “Cover Price” Cowell doesn’t mention that the advertising is the most important part of the financial equation in paying for journalism, not the cover price. It has been so for as long as he’s been a journalist. The word “Advertise” appears three times on this Web page (and “Advertisements” once), but not in Cowell’s column.

MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota.

Maitri has a great write-up of Map Warper, a tool for taking old maps and stretching them (rectifying them) to match another base map.&#0160; Tim Waters has developed an open source tool called Map Warper (Beta) into which you can upload a scanned map, georectify it and save it out as an image or a map layer.&#0160; As a former resident of New Orleans, where a transparent recovery and historic preservation are daily uphill battles, this tool can be invaluable in saving and sharing ancient and new maps of the city’s original development and re-development since Hurricane Katrina and The Flood. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-24-map-warper-stretch-an-old-map-to-fit-the-new-landscape/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.
It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-22-on-the-virtue-of-cheap-paper/">&raquo;</a></p>
