<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They

<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

at the familiar baseball dream through Dominican eyes. The Dominican
Republic has, in recent years, been Major League baseball’s mother
lode. And to the young Dominicans, of course, America is the mother
lode. Boys on the island dream of getting out and — just like Pedro
Martinez or Albert Pujols or “Big Papi” David Ortiz — making it to the
bigs and to its cathedral, Yankee Stadium. Or if not all the way, at
least far enough along baseball’s highway to afford a new home for mom.&#0160;</p><p><a href="http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2471&amp;reviewid=VE1117935902">Variety reviewed it during Sundance</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">

draws the curtain back on the seldom considered world of Dominican
baseball players trying to make it in the United States. Sympathetic,
genial and exceedingly wholesome, it&#39;s a film that, once seen, will
permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the
characters&#39; real-life counterparts. HBO Films offering will be well
received wherever it plays, notably in Latin America; expansion beyond
highly specialized situations in Stateside theatrical release would be
daunting. </p><p>Sugar was shot in Iowa, where the lead character Azucar settles to play single-A ball.&#0160; <a href="http://screenwritingfromiowa.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/sundance-sugar-and-the-strange-land-of-iowa/">From the Screenwriting from Iowa blog</a>:</p><p class="blockquote MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">The filmmakers of <span style="font-style: italic;">Suga</span>r
shot much of the film in Davenport, Iowa and the surrounding Quad
Cities and were one of the first to take advantage of recent tax
incentives for filmmakers who spend over $100,000 in the state.</p>
<p class="blockquote MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Earlier this month Iowa
Governor Chet Culver in speaking about Iowa’s commitment to helping
filmmakers said, “Iowa has a lot to offer the film industry and, quite
frankly, we want more movies filmed in our state. As a television or
motion picture producer with the greatest of expectations, in Iowa, you
can find it all. The new film tax credit and training award send a
clear signal to Hollywood: Iowa is camera-ready and open for business.” </p>
<p>Thanks to Debbie Sobeloff for the heads up about this, who liked it when she saw it in DC because it &quot;treated all of the characters with dignity&quot;.&#0160; I don&#39;t know of any local Ann Arbor show times (not that I ever get out to the movies....)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Laundry is a chore. I&#39;m only slowly getting better at it after most of
a year of having increasing responsibilities.
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Mama mama make me clean. Every day the same routine.&#0160;
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SWX2jBT6Cm0C">Jean Marzollo</a>)<br /></div><p><br />The most important part of doing laundry once you start it is to figure
out what the cycle time is that you need to keep up to make continuous
progress, and then work with that timing in mind as you plan your
effort. If your washing machine takes 45 minutes to run, then going
downstairs 30 minutes later is a wasted trip, and going down an hour
later slows down system throughput considerably.&#0160; No one yet that I know is using any web based time to change the laundry app that monitors your appliance directly, but simple timers or even just knowing that the top of the hour is when you go down to work on it should be enough.</p><p>Laundry works best when clothes and wash are sorted before they get
dumped into the washer. This suggests that every time you put in a load
you should immediately sort the next load, so that there&#39;s no need to
wait any more time that you need to the next time the cycle runs.
Sorting is made a lot easier by having big clearly labeled baskets. (I
never have figured out the symbols.)
</p><p>One school of laundry thought says to do a load every day; the other
says to do all the wash you have to do once a week in a continuous
stream. What is best for you depends on how many kids there are getting
clothes dirty, how many days or weeks of little boy clothing you have
in your stockpile so that there&#39;s always a dry pair of clean pants
during mud puddle season, and what kind of mindless work you can do
while folding. In any case, there&#39;s little to be gained from making
laundry a random process - routines repeated every week make it all
easier.
</p><p>It&#39;s 2:00pm; I promised myself that I&#39;d go to the basement every hour
on the hour and move the process forwards. If I work at this properly
it will take less than 15 minutes to get the next load in and then I&#39;ll
be able to have another 45 minutes of writing time.</p><p>More reading, should you need to, falls in two rather distinct camps: the domestic diva enthusiasm as seen on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#flylady">#flylady</a> , or the art and science of keeping home exemplified by <a href="http://google.com/search?q=cheryl+mendelson+home+comforts">Cheryl Mendelson&#39;s Home Comforts</a>.&#0160; Either way there&#39;s method in the madness, and I haven&#39;t even touched on the strategies of sending all of your wash out to be done, or taking it all to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Laundromats">laundromat</a> weekly for one big megawash. </p>

to reimburse people who purchased Ann Arbor Gold certificates. Earlier
this year, the company that administers the program, CertifiChecks,
filed for bankruptcy.<br /></div><p><br />An April 15 story from the AP notes that <a href="http://www.newarkadvocate.com/article/20090415/NEWS01/904150314/1002/rss01">the bankruptcy filing has gone through in Dayton, OH (via the Newark Advocate):</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">CertifiChecks Inc., which abruptly closed in February, filed for
Chapter 7 Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. CertifiChecks listed assets of $1 million in personal property
that included funds in savings and checking accounts in the filing. It
also listed liabilities of $460,000.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">A recorded message at the
court clerk&#39;s number for automated case information said a meeting of
the company&#39;s creditors was scheduled for June 10.</p><p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.speakoutohio.gov/speak-out/what-you-should-know-about-certifichecks-bankruptcy">what the Ohio Attorney General has to say about the matter</a>:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">On April 13, Dayton-based gift certificate company CertifiChecks,

Court Southern District of Ohio, Dayton Division.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">You must file your Proof of Claim with the bankruptcy court by
September 8, 2009.&#0160; Filing a Proof of Claim tells the court that you
are a “creditor” (which means that money may be due to you).&#0160; It also
helps to ensure that you will receive important updates about the
bankruptcy.&#0160; You can even fill out a <a href="http://www.ohsb.uscourts.gov/pdffiles/B10claimform1005.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of Claim form electronically</a>.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.speakoutohio.gov/wp-content/uploads/4-14-09-notice-of-chapter-7-bankruptcy-case-meeting-of-creditors-deadlines.pdf" target="_blank">Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy – United States Bankruptcy Court</a></p><p>I&#39;ll assume that chambers of commerce who redeem their members gift certificates will take a loss, and that they will bundle up all of the certificates redeemed for the bankruptcy court; I have no idea how much of this &quot;money&quot; is recoverable, but Chapter 7 means the organization is liquidating not to return to business.</p>

but if you do so, make sure you read the Ann Arbor city ordinances and all of the very, very fine print very carefully:
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
No permit shall be issued to a person, by the City, and no chickens shall be allowed to be kept unless the owners of all residentially
zoned adjacent properties (see 9:42(3)(j)) consent in writing to the permit. Please attach the Adjacent Neighbor Consent Form to
this application and check the box that you understand and have complied with the terms of this ordinance requirement.<br />
 <br /></div><br /><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
If the requirements of Chapter 107 are not complied with, the City may revoke any permit granted and/or initiate prosecution for a
civil infraction violation. A person who has been issued a permit shall submit it for examination upon demand by any police officer or
code enforcement officer. Fenced enclosures are subject to all provisions of Chapter 104 (Fences). Notwithstanding the issuance of a
permit by the City, private restrictions on the use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit. Private
restrictions include but are not limited to deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws,
and covenant deeds. A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens
is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.repastspresentandfuture.org/123-people-eat-at-selma-cafe-and-king-of-calm-silvio-medoro-does-not-break-a-sweat/#respond">What happens if the man doesn&#39;t agree with your poultry easement</a>: you get a personal visit from the city attorney (!!!!!) who is apparently the city&#39;s only animal control officer.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We decided we were not interested in pursuing the official permit,
as we are a bit out of compliance anyway and do not really feel this
should be required (that this process is more just a way for the city
to ease into a common sense practice). The city attorney hand delivered
a notice telling us of all our waywardness. I will post a
notice/petition of support out front. Please come by and sign it when
you get a chance. Thanks!!</p><p>Read the <a href="http://www.chickenvideo.com/topten.html">Top Ten Reasons to Raise Your Own Yard Hens</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">

when they are prolonged. Perishable foods should not be held above 40
degrees for more than 2 hours. If a power outage is 2 hours or less,
you need not be concerned, but how do you save your food when the
refrigerator is out for longer times? Being prepared can help. By
planning ahead, you can save your perishables.</p><p>USDA, <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/keeping_food_Safe_during_an_emergency/index.asp">Keeping Food Safe During an Emergency</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible
    to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food
    safely cold for about 4 hours if it is unopened. A full freezer
    will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if
    it is half full) if the door remains closed. Obtain dry or block
    ice to keep your refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is
    going to be out for a prolonged period of time. Fifty pounds of
    dry ice should hold an 18-cubic foot full freezer for 2 days. Plan
    ahead and know where dry ice and block ice can be purchased. </p><p>CDC, <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/poweroutage/needtoknow.asp">What you need to know when the power goes out unexpectedly</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of your food right

author Milan Pelouch freely shares everything he's learned during his
years of morel hunting. The book covers all aspects of finding and
eating morels: identification of true and false morels; what to wear
(and not to wear) and take with you on mushroom hunts; when to search
for morels; the best places to look for them; cleaning and preservation
methods; and, of course, delicious recipes using morels in dozens of
different dishes, from soups to entrées. Although the author's
preferred hunting area is northern Michigan, his tips can be used in
any location in the United States.</p><p></p><p>If you want Scientific Research to go with your morels, see <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/7247581354685p6p/">doi:10.1007/BF02858213</a>, a touching account from a Harvard lad fresh to the Michigan woods published as Morchellamania in Michigan, Economic Botany, Volume 33, Number 1 / January, 1979. </p><p>Any day you can go for a walk in the woods is a good day!</p>

      <p>Writing for the Internet is not the same as writing for print.&#0160; Here are ten rules of thumb that will help you shape your writing that&#39;s designed for the screen and to help you adapt and reform words that were first printed out in ways that make them easier to manage.</p><ol>
<li>The paragraph is the unit of composition.&#0160; Keep your paragraphs together, making it possible to have any one of them pulled out and quoted in some other part of the internet without losing too much in the process.&#0160; If your narrative has complicated paragraphs, be aware that someone might pull out only a sentence from it. </li>
<li>Write where it&#39;s easy to find what you said.&#0160;&#0160; </li>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year I look forward to finding pea greens, so that I can stir fry them up.&#0160; And every year at the farmer&#39;s market I don&#39;t find them.&#0160; I hope this year can be different, but I have some questions.</p><p>If I wanted to grow pea greens on my own, what variety of peas would I use?<br />Are pea vines usually sprayed, and would you want to look out for no-spray vendors?<br />When is the best time to pick?<br />Do you lose all of the pod harvest or can you have both?<br />If I harvested a bushel of vines from a U-Pick operation would they look at me funny?</p><p>Our traditional pea-picking weekend here is Father&#39;s Day, when we go to Rawsonville for peas and strawberries and we make sure to take sunblock and water (note to future self).</p>
