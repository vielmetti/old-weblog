<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>In this lecture on &quot;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Syndicate,&quot; speaker Jon Udell will review a case study — conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere — that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.</p>
<p>Udell is an author, information architect, software developer, and new media innovator. In 2007 Udell joined Microsoft Research as a writer, interviewer, speaker, and experimental software developer. Currently he is building and explaining a calendar network that&#39;s based on open standards and runs in the Windows Azure cloud.</p>
<p>His 1999 book,&#0160;<em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>, helped lay the foundation for what we now call social software. Udell was formerly a software developer at Lotus,&#0160;<em>BYTE</em>&#0160;magazine&#39;s executive editor and Web maven, and an independent consultant.</p>
<p>A hands-on thinker, Udell&#39;s analysis of industry trends has always been informed by his own ongoing experiments with software, information architecture, and new media.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2006 he was&#0160;<em>InfoWorld&#39;s</em>&#0160;lead analyst, author of the weekly Strategic Developer column, and blogger-in-chief. During his&#0160;<em>InfoWorld</em>&#0160;tenure he also pioneered the medium now known as screencasting and produced an audio show, Interviews with Innovators.</p>
<p>Udell provided the following abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;In&#0160;<em>Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read</em>&#0160;(1955), Rudolf Flesch ranted that &#39;horrible, stupid, emasculated, pointless, tasteless little readers&#39; were depriving kids of &#39;<em>Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>The Arabian Nights</em>&#0160;and Mark Twain, and anything interesting and worthwhile.&#39; He&#0160; argued: &#39;If you equip kids with the right conceptual tools they can read anything.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;As we colonize the cloud we can read — and write — in important new ways. But we&#39;re failing to equip most people with the right conceptual tools for these emerging modes of literacy. A web of connected information systems entails such concepts as authority over data, indirection, standard ways to structure and exchange data, controlled vocabularies, publish-and-subscribe networks, and use and recombination of services.</p>
<p>&quot;Students of the computer and information sciences learn and apply these principles. Others can too, but because they mostly don&#39;t they remain stuck at a &#39;Fun with Dick and Jane&#39; level of Web literacy.</p>
<p>&quot;In this talk we&#39;ll review a case study, conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere, that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013.</p>
<p>From NPR, the FAA is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/16/169555027/faa-grounds-all-787-planes-in-the-u-s-to-seek-a-fix-for-battery-issue" target="_self">grounding 787s because of battery problems</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston.</em></p>
<p>What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020149011_787batterydamagexml.html" target="_self">according to the Seattle Times</a>:</p>
<p><em>Hot chemicals sprayed out of the battery on the 787 Dreamliner in this week’s emergency landing in Japan, leaving a gooey dark residue and suggesting a different malfunction than last week’s 787 battery fire in Boston, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21054089" target="_self">BBC</a>&#0160;gives the detail in a timeline:</p>
<p><em><strong>15 January:</strong>&#0160;ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube is forced to land shortly after take-off due to battery problems. The airline grounds all its 17 Dreamliners. Japan Airlines follows suit, grounding its fleet of seven 787s</em></p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.piersystem.com/external/content/document/1914/1683411/1/SJC%20ANA%20update.pdf" target="_self">more detail from the San Jose airport</a>, which has flights affected by the cancellations:</p>
<p>Statement from ANA released 1/16/13: <br />ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube to Haneda made an emergency landing at Takamatsu <br />Airport at 8.47am on Wednesday, 16 January due to a technical problem. The aircraft’s <br />instruments registered a problem related to a battery and crew also detected an unusual smell in <br />the cabin and the cockpit. All 137 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft. The <br />event was registered as a serious incident by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and <br />Tourism (MLIT). ANA will cooperate fully with the Japan Transport Safety Board, relevant <br />authorities, and Boeing to investigate the cause of the incident. All ANA flights operated by <br />Boeing 787 have been cancelled on 16 January 2013. <br />January 16, 2013<br />All Nippon Airways, Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Reuters notes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS_Yuasa" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="GS Yuasa">GS Yuasa</a> makes the battery, and its stock took a hit. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-boeing-dreamliner-gsyuasabre90g01h-20130116,0,6174042.story" target="_self">Reuters via Chicago Tribune</a>:</p>
<p><em>TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of GS Yuasa Corp shed 5.9 percent to 302 yen on Thursday after All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said the main battery on the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BA" rel="googlefinance" target="_blank" title="NYSE: BA">Boeing</a>&#39;s 787 Dreamliner that made an emergency landing on Wednesday was discolored and there were signs of leakage.</em></p>
<p>In happier times, here was the press release about the Lithium ion batteries from GS Yuasa:</p>
<p><em>June 12, 2005, Thales will incorporate the latest lithium-ion technology from Japan’s leading battery manufacturer, GS Yuasa, in the Electrical Power Conversion System of Boeing’s next generation commercial airliner, the 787 Dreamliner. The multi-year, multi-million dollar contract is a historic first as it marks the first commercial aviation application of Li-ion technology anywhere in the world.</em></p>
<p>And, after a bunch of digging, here&#39;s a really good analysis of <a href="http://www.avweb.com/blogs/insider/AVwebInsider_DreamlinerFire_207979-1.html" target="_self">The Dreamliner&#39;s Battery Fire</a>, by Paul Bertorelli on AVweb. Worth reading through the whole thing for an insight into why this is a big issue for Boeing. Emphasis added.</p>
<p><em>This is serious stuff for Boeing and could put a significant dent in the airplane&#39;s certification basis if they can&#39;t figure out a solution. When Boeing proposed the Dreamliner a decade ago, it spec&#39;d lithium-ion batteries for the airplane&#39;s innovative electrical power conversion system, which is made by Thales, with batteries from Yuasa. The airplane can also use conventional NiCad cells but either way, batteries provide starting energy for the APU and back-up power for other systems. At the time, the hazards of Li-ion were known, but Boeing wanted the weight savings and power density that only Li-ion can offer. Working with the FAA, it developed new certification standards for batteries under so-called special conditions. That required sophisticated electronics to provide overcharge and charge imbalance protection and physical thermal containment. Taken together and on paper, those precautions look more than robust enough to meet the stringent safety requirements of a modern airliner.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Well, maybe not</strong>. When I was researching Li-ion batteries for aircraft last year, I heard real concerns that the Li-ion main ship/starting battery risk wasn&#39;t yet well understood.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-15-storing-something-somewhere-you-can-remember-it/">storing something somewhere you can remember it</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Not so much &quot;where did I put my glasses&quot;, but &quot;how do I make sure that I find something the next time I&#39;m looking for it online&quot;. A piece of it is also &quot;how do other people find it when they&#39;re looking for it&quot;, but for this exercise it&#39;s the personal search pattern and not the global search pattern that matters.</p>
<p>My current workflow admits multiple patterns for doing this, and I suspect that the answer to my question is to do more than one save, depending on how important it is to save something. I&#39;ll take them in order.</p>
<p>1. Write something down in my blog. There&#39;s only about 2000 posts here, which is much smaller than the size of the net, and so I should be able to refind it if I&#39;ve blogged about it. The corresponding search is either a keyword search through Google with the refinement &quot;site:vielmetti.typepad.com&quot; or a search through the Typepad dashboard back end.</p>
<p>2. Save it to Pinboard. (Previously, this would have been save it to Delicious). I have about 18000 bookmarks there, mostly from a couple of years ago, and many of them have good tags and good text to search through. Pinboard is a rich source of the sort of stuff I like, but retrieval depends on carefully grooming the tags you apply every time you get back a search.</p>
<p>3. Post to Twitter. Twitter&#39;s searching tools are lousy, but I have about 3000 followers, and if I send out anything good chances are someone else will remember it. Twitter is promising a personal search and when they get it the system will seem less write-mostly and will help me figure out which sandwiches I like and which buses have squeaky brakes. As a bonus, my Twitter posts are being archived to Pinboard so there&#39;s a fighting chance I can look it up again there.</p>
<p>4. Post to Facebook. Facebook seems to be write-mostly, read-little, but again there&#39;s the ever-promising search improvements that will support unlikely syntaxes like &quot;people who like sandwiches who live near Oshkosh&quot;. If I ever need to do a search like that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find it.</p>
<p>5. Save to Evernote. I only have a tiny amount of stuff there, but it&#39;s saving full text of things more so than just pointers, and so the search experience is richer. I wonder if I can coerce Pinboard to do more things so that I&#39;m less tempted by Evernote.</p>
<p>6. Write on Arborwiki, or some other narrowly focused wiki. This works best for things you want to remember that don&#39;t have to have your name attached to it. If I&#39;m salting away details about the local environment, Arborwiki has about 10000 existing pages to add to, and that&#39;s enough to make it worthwhile to make incremental improvements to.</p>
<p>The common elements here seem to be scale - a system is appealing when it has at least a few thousand elements already in it, but not so huge like Wikipedia where any individual contribution is washed out by the enormity of the whole. It&#39;s nice to have non-Google places to put things where the search language and syntax has a bit more finesse, especially if there&#39;s a backup plan to use Google as well.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &quot;social graph&quot;. <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130115/p31#a130115p31" target="_self">Techmeme&#39;s front page</a> has plenty of commentary.</p>
<p>I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR (January 13, 2013, 11:06 pm) - A fire at a 6 unit apartment building at 1310 Packard in Ann Arbor sent 6 people to the hospital, all in stable condition, <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290656100750073856" target="_self">according to a report</a> from Michigan Daily reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam" target="_self">Sam Gringlas</a> who is on the scene and who spoke with Huron Valley Ambulance spokeswoman Joyce Williams. A <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290646279883718656/photo/1" target="_self">photograph</a> from the reporter shows smoke billowing out of a window.</p>
<p>At 9:13 p.m. the fire was reportedly &quot;fully involved&quot;, and fire dispatch (monitored via scanner) called for mutual aid assistance. Units from multiple neighboring jurisdictions including Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township came to the scene.</p>
<p>Packard is blocked between Wells and Brooklyn, and motorists should seek alternative routes.</p>
<p>The building was <a href="http://www.commercialiq.com/listing/2378234" target="_self">listed for sale</a>, with an asking price of $550,000, on CommercialIQ.</p>
<p>The building is owned by The High-way Company Interational LLC,&#0160;Bashar J Abdulsattar as registered agent.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system.</p>
<p>Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &quot;item&quot;) and the subsequent responses. Items and responses have numbers, so that you can refer unambiguously to 6:23 and someone can go back and read that. Conferences have names, and membership in a conference is controlled down to the individual level if the organizer so desires.</p>
<p>A typical Confer conference either had a very narrow, focused point of view with a set of people trying to tackle some specific issue, or a general point of view open to all comers with very little restriction on the topics. A conference might be open ended, or it could be shut down after a decided on period of time when the work was concluded.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use weblogs like Confer, sorta kinda, but they give relatively too much power to the blog owner (the person who authors posts, or &quot;items&quot;) in shaping the discussion. My words are always at the top of the page, which doesn&#39;t always make for good dialog. Group blogs help somewhat, though there&#39;s still an editorial focus that doesn&#39;t feel like a conference.</p>
<p>Private Facebook groups, especially those that are carefully tended, come closer to Confer behavior. You have the same item and response structure, and a similar level of control over who participates. The biggest issue is that old Facebook posts scroll off into the mists of time, and it&#39;s hard to have a lot of conversations going on at once without overwhelming the board. This contrasts with Confer where judicious use of the &quot;forget&quot; command could keep one noisy item from overwhelming the whole thing.</p>
<p>Finally, of all things, the Github &quot;issues&quot; board has a very similar structure to Confer, with items (&quot;issues&quot;) and responses neatly threaded. It has some of the less-used abilities of Confer to categorize and organize items, plus a well thought-out cross reference facility so that a link to another issue is easy to turn into something that you can click through.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve gone from an era of computing scarcity to an era of embarrassing plenty.&#0160;What&#39;s missing from everything is the sense that this mainframe that you were typing at was the only thing that was absorbing everyone&#39;s online attention, and that there really wasn&#39;t anything else that had the same density of local contacts and connections. The Internet is chockablock with online discussion and sharing systems looking to capture a piece of your daily energy, with more coming all the time. The era of the centralized mainframe with the centralized discussion board is over, no matter how compelling the features of its time seemed to be.&#0160;</p>

      <p>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)</p>
<p>This week&#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college. The answers ranged from selling pots and pans door to door to selling ice cream in Manhattan to running a student bus company to programming PDP-8 computers. One person was there who was in college now and he talked about his startup that connects bands with bars.</p>
<p>The technology of the week was the notice that <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michiganterminalsystem/discussions/mts-today/6mtsrunningonaraspberrypi" target="_self">the Michigan Terminal System has been made to work on the ultra-small Raspberry Pi system</a>. A photo shows the setup.</p>

<p>Organizing an event that happens every week is easy, especially when the venue is open. All you have to do is show up every single week, invite anyone you can find, and make sure that if someone arrives twice that you remember their name. It helps if you happen to be part of a community where people have learned to communicate online for a long time, and where the online community and the in-person community dovetail nicely.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Connecting William Street is a redevelopment project that the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is working on to make better use of properties which are currently surface parking lots. The grand plan envisions relatively dense development on these lots.</p>
<p>For background reading see the <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/current_projects/a2p5_/" target="_self">DDA site for Connecting William Street</a>, the <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/tag/Connecting%20William%20Street/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com coverage of Connecting William Street</a>, and &#0160;the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/tag/connecting-william-street/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle coverage of Connecting William Street</a>. If you&#39;re coming at it from scratch, expect to spend about an hour chewing on the debates to date. Or, you could be like most people and not really care to read every excruciating detail of every minor functionary&#39;s opinions on the project, and every excruciating opinion from the pseudonymous commenter crowd. </p>
<p>William Street is not a fun street to walk down, especially compared to Liberty Street one block over. There&#39;s not a density of retail that makes window shopping appealing, and two entire blocks are given over to parking. The question is whether municipal intervention in the planning process can enliven this area and at the same time generate a return on the investment in the land that&#39;s better than what parking can provide.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with William Street, and one that no easy planning process can address, is the horrible car-pedestrian interface at the Fourth and William parking structure. Cars enter and exit to the sidewalk without much in the way of sight lines to help avoid collisions, and it&#39;s a busy enough structure that if you go from Main to Fourth past the structure you&#39;re bound to have to make a quick step to preserve your good health. No matter what else you do with all of the other properties, there&#39;s still going to be a barrier that separates Main Street from points to the east, and anyone with a choice as to where to walk is going to detour towards Liberty.</p>
<p>Build all you want, but the giant hulk of a parking structure smack in the middle of your development effort is going to overshadow any attempts you make to build a pleasant streetscape.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet/">What is the goal of the Internet?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that the Internet is a very large, elaborate, multi-player game. What are its winning conditions?
<p>
0. Make money fast. That proves to be difficult, but it&#39;s been pitched so many times that it should go up front first. If you can&#39;t make money quickly, then at least make the promise that you are growing something that will eventually make money even if it&#39;s not making money now.</p>
<p>
1. Increase the n. Find something of desire, and add to it. Games built into social network services (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) behave this way, all in somewhat different details but all measured by simple increases in how many things you collect. Lots of systems have naive but effective ways of prompting you to continue simply by helping you count how much you have played so far.</p>
<p>
2. Reduce the hop count. This is a network game players point of view, most easily visible to those with experience playing in the UUCP and Internet routing networks, but also to a certain degree on high-degree social networks. Find something far away of desire, and work systematically to bring it closer. For an added bonus, make the online equivalent of a back stage pass that quickly gets you access to a sense of intimacy that you would otherwise have to earn.</p>
<p>
3. Decrease the n. Like Sisyphus, we work to reduce the size of our inbox daily. The seasonal holiday of Discardia is a good time to do a purge of whatever we no longer treasure, to make room for the things that are awesome. Good writing includes good editing, which means omitting needless words. At a social extreme are the deletionist Wikipedians, who believe that a better encyclopedia doesn&#39;t include marginal and unimportant articles.</p>
<p>
4. Reduce mean time to response. A well developed network gets a prompt, smart, generous response to queries. That&#39;s hard to keep up 24x7, but when you are on you can be exceptional in your ability to gain trust. &quot;The courtesy of a prompt response is appreciated.&quot;</p>
<p>
5. Increase bandwidth. It&#39;s always better to have more bits streaming in, even if you aren&#39;t using them all at once. The same goes for screen size and screen resolution - you can never have enough.</p>
<p>
6. Reduce latency and lag. From first-person shooters to international video chat, lag and latency are your enemy. Work as hard as possible to trim milliseconds from your enviroment so that you can enjoy it in real time.</p>
<p>
7. Increase the size of the lunch table. If you are having lunch with friends, you want the size of the table to fill the venue without overflowing. The restaurant will love you if you keep it full, and you&#39;ll have that many more people to appreciate and think of.</p>
<p>
8. Collect badges and prizes. Amassing credentials is a part of any good game, whether it be Foursquare mayorships at the local cafe or college degrees or professional certificates. Play the game until you prove that you have won it.</p>
<p>9. Be the first to experience something. Whether it&#39;s making the first comment on a post, writing the first review of a new product, or going to a restaurant on opening night, the person who has the quick draw on the hot new item wins. There&#39;s a benefit for novelty and being part of the in crowd that knows what&#39;s new.</p>
<p>10. Outlast your rivals. Slow, plodding diligence is enough to win some races, where you simply wait for your counterparts to give up on the game that you&#39;re playing. Your ability to keep at a task year upon year means that eventually your gray hair will be a mark of your genius, just because there&#39;s no one else around to challenge your version of the story.</p></p>

      <p>It doesn&#39;t run on 10.5.8, so I&#39;m holding this review until after I upgrade to 10.6.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t work on 10.6.8 either, just coming up with a &quot;Loading&quot; screen that hangs their seemingly forever. I&#39;m on an early 2008 MacBook, certainly not the fastest computer in the world, but one that is usually adequate to the task of running most software.</p>
<p>After prompt help from Bluestacks tech support, I tried again, this time first closing my Chrome browser windows before starting. Lo and behold, it fired up promptly. The diagnosis &#0160;was &quot;not enough memory&quot;, and sure enough once I turned off my browser there was enough memory left to get it to start.</p>
<p>From all I could tell of using the system with one app loaded (Twitter), it was a faithful emulation of the Android environment. There&#39;s an app store or two so that you can get new stuff. But once I started to load more than one app at a time, the system started to bog down again, and the output from &quot;top&quot; showed a load average of 7+ and no free system memory.</p>
<p>I&#39;m willing concede that it might work on some computers, but it&#39;s not working well enough on mine to be anything but a curiousity. It certainly can&#39;t run on this system at the same time as my browser. There is hope that a future release will be more sparing of memory, in which case I&#39;ll give it another try.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There is a tremendous appeal to the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/06/15/Deletionist-Morons">deletionist</a> point of view.
<p>
I spent some time this evening improving Wikipedia by suggesting that some of its less well written articles be removed. The task was relatively simple; hit the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">random page</a>&quot; button, read the article, decide if it is so horrible as to be unencyclopedic, and if it is then paste in the &quot;please delete this&quot; template and hope for the best.
</p>
<p>
Combing through a series of random pages on Wikipedia is more grim than I had expected. Many of the articles were very short, to the typical tune of &quot;X is a village with 42 inhabitants&quot; or &quot;Y was an indifferent soccer player on a minor league team&quot;. A surprising number of articles were years old and read &quot;Z will be a television series on a minor television network&quot; with no one bothering to follow up to see whether the series was kept or cancelled.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t always been a deletionist. There was a time when you&#39;d find me in Wikipedia more often than not improving some minor but notable page to make it incrementally better in the hopes that it would not be deleted, or arguing to keep some minimally important article from being deleted. The experience of working through random pages was sufficiently enlightening about the general quality of the work there that it seemed more productive to argue instead to wipe out some of the less well considered contributions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com">My weblog</a> is similarly full of indifferent contributions, posts which seem to have been a good idea at the time but which don&#39;t have much to argue for themselves now. For a long time I had a habit of writing very short and poorly edited posts just in order to get something out quickly, and I&#39;d love to revisit those and improve them by taking them offline.
</p>
<p>
A help to solid improvement of a large body of work is some way to randomly index your way through the system and work on the next random piece that comes up in front of you. The standard Typepad system does not have any sort of &quot;random post&quot; structure, so I&#39;ll need to somehow improvise. What I think I can do is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/import_export.html">export the entire contents of my blog</a>, write a script to pull out just the titles and URLs of the posts, then generate something that pulls a random line from that list. If I can do that then I can go back randomly and be ruthless in pruning out things that don&#39;t belong any more.
</p>
<p>
Ideally there&#39;s some basis for the notion that rather than writing new words all the time, I should be looking at ways of improving some of the old ones instead. That germ of a good idea, half explored in 150 words 5 years ago, might make a good 750 word essay now. That poorly executed quick post of 7 years ago might be deleted to make room for a better issue now. No one will miss the old words, and I might be able to free up space in my memory for something more positive.
</p>
<p>
The deletionist point of view, when applied too aggressively, can also be pretty grim. The grim reaper decides that one person&#39;s hard work is unworthy of inclusion and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers">attacks everything they do</a> until that contributor goes away. If you get hit by a deletionist of that type, your only best approach is to move your contributions to some other medium where you can contribute without attracting undue attention.
</p>
<p>
My randomized approach to editorial review is much more like the &quot;<a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html">chaos monkey</a>&quot; used by some cloud-based online services to ensure that their carefully constructed and complicated system is resilient in the case of failure. The chaos monkey takes down parts of a redundant system at random, forcing it to respond in the way that systems designers had planned for an outage. Because you are exercising the failures in a controlled way you can be prepared for uncontrolled failure at some future time.
</p>
<p>
I was able to download the entire blog corpus, and to write <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools/blob/master/randomline">the little script that pulled out a random title from the total</a>. It&#39;s now also time to start doing other textual analysis on this word-hoard, looking for words that are used unusually frequently, or subjects that come up more often than I had imagined. With the right tool set there should be lots of good meta-information that I can reuse and turn into new ideas. After all, there&#39;s more than a decade worth of stuff buried in almost 10 megabytes of text, and I&#39;m sure that at least 10% of it is deletable without the slightest loss to anyone.

A most famous case is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/as-easy-as-abc-georges-perec-once-wrote-a-whole-novel-without-the-letter-e-kevin-jackson-summarises-an-oulipian-life-in-26-sentences-1420994.html" target="_self">an entire novel </a>written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format.
<p>
A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. A little nubbin under a <a href="http://www.thebookyard.com/apple_keycaps.php" target="_self">keycap</a> still works, so I can use an &quot;h&quot; regardless, albeit a bit more slowly and self-consciously. Imagine writing, every time you use a particular letter your finger got a tactile reminder of a letter you were using is special, and you&#39;re pretty close to my result.
</p>
<p>
If I were in an Oulipoean mood, I&#39;d write exclusively omitting a letter from my text, and compose words only missing it. Absent a definite article, my efforts will refer only to one of many possible versions of a work, and never pin it down to a particular one. It&#39;s not so difficult, so long as you are willing to investigate synonyms as you run into words requiring a forbidden letter.
</p>
<p>
A style of Oulipo allows a writer to be self aware of a constraint, and to comment on it as one goes about doing work of writing. Formal restrictions on your work force you into creative patterns omitting or adding certain types of typical constructions. It also slows you down quite a bit, since a forbidden letter at a center of a keyboard is always a tempting target, and a large void to be avoided.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad for a task of needing to do some interesting avoidance of a key. It is a distraction from a temporary and transient annoyance, sure to be solved by a trip to a nearby <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/briarwood/" target="_self">Genius Bar</a>, a place of keycap magic. I was careful to save all parts lost in my endeavor to do a self repair, alas at least one of my magic bits of plastic may be broken. I&#39;m certain a fine Apple employee will be able to set it back to its original state.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to keep your own voice as you try to write and always skip a missing key?  Writing is like talking to a page, and if you are required to omit a fraction of your vocabulary as you do it, a great bit of easy spontaneity is lost. Surprisingly, a key in question albeit a frequently used one is not difficult to type around. A real obstacle is a need to be indefinite about objects referred to, but it is not impossible, just strange.
</p>
<p>
In general, a world we live in always admits a possibility of doing well by not always possessing precisely an item we are used to. If a car is not working, it&#39;s easier to take a bus, walk, or bicycle. If power goes out, we visit our friends from next door more easily. Dietary restrictions like a ban on milk products spur creation of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/04/vegan_chocolate.html" target="_self">delicious vegan treats</a>. It&#39;s not always easy to make a transition away from routines, but new routines fall into place as backups to our usual well trodden ways.
</p>
<p>
I am writing in <a href="http://750words.com" target="_self">750 words</a>, a clever tool in its way of keeping track of not just words being typed but also sentiment and tone of a piece of prose. Seven score more words to write, and it&#39;s starting to feel like a burden just to get out words to make sense. So far a difficulty is a feeling of disjointedness, not so difficult to come to decisions on individual words, but connecting words are strangely missing and require odd constructions to work around. In a way, it&#39;s a struggle just to make sense at all. Of course it&#39;s also a bit late, and I&#39;m tired, and it&#39;s a new year of its own.
</p>
<p>
My struggle is not a unique one in our family, as one additional keyboard is also missing keys. I believe a &quot;c&quot; and an &quot;x&quot; are missing from said keyboard, again posing compositional difficulties of late as I am led to believe. Working your way around a void is at first a struggle, until you obtain a pattern and meter allowing you to carry on regardless. I&#39;ll feel quite a bit better as soon as a new &quot;h&quot; key is put into place.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details.
<p>
I&#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&#39;s stumped me before. I&#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked.
</p>
<p>
The key bit which I didn&#39;t use before was a screwdriver. The particular tub in question has an overflow hatch which holds the drain plug lifter, and by using a screwdriver I was able to disassemble that hatch and remove a gizmo and then, once all the pieces were apart, I could use the plastic drain snake to get at the hair clog. (Ew.) About ten minutes after starting work on the project today, the drain ran free. Hooray!
</p>
<p>
How hard can it be to clear a drain? Well, the challenge is to have the right combination of the time to work on it, the necessary tools, the insight as to what all you might try new that you hadn&#39;t tried before, and a determination not to allow a temporary setback to slow you down. Don&#39;t have a screwdriver? A quarter and a vise grip make an adequate substitute. That fancy drain snake you tried before didn&#39;t work out so well? Visit the hardware store and see what other designs there are.
</p>
<p>
What makes this project different from most is that it had been waiting months to complete, months where I stood in the shower with the water accumulating wondering how I was going to fix the problem, months where various other attempts to fix didn&#39;t work out so well.
</p>
<p>
I suppose that a lot of problems we run into look like this. The head on approach with a simple set of tools fails to fix the problem, we&#39;re frustrated by the results, and then the situation languishes for a long time without any headway. Some day you look at the problem with fresh eyes and get an aha! insight that transforms the issue from one thing into something completely different, and the fresh attack hits the transformed problem and it clears up quickly.
</p>
<p>
The unsuccessful problem-solving of the day was a friend&#39;s snow blower, which had sat for an entire winter last year unused and thus we think has bad gas in the tank. The obvious approaches of trying the electric starter and the pull starter failed to result in the motor catching, and so the best guess is that draining the gas tank and refilling with fresh fuel will be the right way to solve the problem. This of course transforms the problem from &quot;start the snowblower&quot; to &quot;refill the gas tank of the snowblower&quot; and assumes that all of the starter motors work just fine and they do seem to.
</p>
<p>
I really should be able to tackle more straightforward tasks head on. There&#39;s a temptation to write down the task before addressing it, and then turning the written down task into something which is a subject of some endless refinement. So often it would be easier just to decide to tackle something and do it than to sort through an infinite list of possible tasks saying &quot;no, not now, later&quot; over and over again. It is not always obvious which things are straightforward and which will take hours or weeks of work.
</p>
<p>
Often the best way to get something done is to simply say that you&#39;re not going to stop until it&#39;s complete, sit down, get comfortable in working on it, and then grind through the problem until it has reached a single satisfactory answer. Deciding which one thing to do can be harder than getting that one thing done.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-30-some-reflection-on-use-of-github-as-an-issue-tracker-two-weeks-in/">Some reflection on use of Github as an issue tracker, two weeks in</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Two weeks ago, I started <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">using Github as an issue tracker</a> to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&#39;s some reflection on that use.
<p>
I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order. I&#39;ve tried <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/noguchi_filing_.html" target="_self">systems on paper</a>, a bunch of electronic systems, various gizmos, you name it I&#39;ve probably either done it or considered it. There&#39;s a piece of me that expects that this is a temporary enthusiasm and that I&#39;ll be printing out some of this before I close my Github account down. But while that temporary enthusiasm lasts, it&#39;s been a pretty good run.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried to work the process in parallel with an &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/getting_to_inbo.html" target="_self">inbox zero</a>&quot; approach of getting tasks out of my inbox and into my issue tracker. At the moment the inbox is down to five, and it&#39;s probably ten minutes work to get it back to zero. It&#39;s been nice not having an infinite inbox to plow through, and often that has meant that when there&#39;s a quick answer to something that I can dash it off and get back to zero status for a while. That feels good.
</p>
<p>
As I&#39;ve used the system what has evolved into a routine is labeling each task, so that everything has a proper color code. &quot;Housekeeping&quot; is bright yellow, &quot;finance&quot; is green, &quot;connect&quot; is blue, and so forth. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/04/radial-categorization-and-the-trouble-with-tags.html" target="_self">Obtaining sensible and non-overlapping categories is a challenge</a>, and that will probably continue to evolve slowly over time. An item can be in more than one category and it&#39;s easy to switch categories so there&#39;s no burden of getting it wrong permanently.
</p>
<p>
The goal in these categories is to identify some kind of balance among all of the various things I&#39;m trying to take on and not to let any one part of my efforts get out of line with the others. For example, earlier this week I noticed that the &quot;finance&quot; category had 11 outstanding tasks and 2 completed tasks, whereas the &quot;connect&quot; category had twice as many completed tasks as outstanding. If things are going to pile up in my life, I want them to pile up evenly, and it&#39;s always reasonable to look at the category with the most tasks and do a quick review and see if there&#39;s anything easy to lop off.
</p>
<p>
A memorable success in this ongoing struggle to keep things in order is the ongoing task of cleaning the basement, which somehow went from being tidy to being a mess over the last few years, and which is inhabited by way too much in the way of dead electronics. A whole string of tech support tasks were gated behind being able to get a good backup of my Mac, and in the process of cleaning the basement I realized that I had a Firewire cable entangled in amongst dozens of old and useless power adapters. A bit of cable unsnagging and I was able to plow through <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/technology-upgrades-are-a-tedious-but-necessary-task.html" target="_self">half a dozen system upgrade issues</a> that had piled up, all dependent on one another.
</p>
<p>
Github has a remote access application to its issue tracker from mobile devices, so at least in theory I should be able to manage the list from my smart phone. Alas, issue #1 is &quot;get a new smart phone&quot;, since my elderly Blackberry is more of a dumb phone than anything these days. The Android app is serviceable if a bit clunky feeling, and I&#39;ll see how the iPhone/iPad app compares. In practice it&#39;s not 100% necessary to sync up with tasks the instant they come to mind or are completed, and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2012/08/planning-ahead-as-far-as-you-can-brainstorm-story-ideas.html" target="_self">paper still comes in handy</a> when compiling the short list of things to do next or brainstorming new ideas that might eventually get done.
</p>
<p>
Of course I haven&#39;t done everything I set out to do; no one could. What I figure is that there&#39;s some happy number somewhere more than 100 and less than 150 of things that I might want to do or need to do soonish, and that if I set my mind to it I can write down enough stuff so that there&#39;s always something easy to pick from that is useful. The harder tasks (that new phone, and all of the choices around it) gravitate to the bottom of the list, and you can sort through the bottom just as easily as you can sort through the top. I&#39;m not convinced that this is the only way or even the best way to feel like I&#39;m staying on top of the world, but it&#39;s really nice and reassuring that I can look at the &quot;closed issues&quot; list and say &quot;yes, I did that&quot;.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Technology upgrades are a tedious but necessary task.
<p>
I&#39;m going through this now, with an upgrade from Mac OS 10.5.8 to Mac OS 10.6.8 on my black MacBook. The world decided in its infinite wisdom that <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2599452">10.5 was too old to keep supporting</a>, and so quite a bit of software was starting to break. The promise is that 10.6.x will last a bit longer and keep my old 2008 vintage system running for a while longer.
</p>
<p>
Upgrades are always fraught with peril. In this case, it involved sticking a DVD in the drive, clicking a few times, and then waiting 45 minutes for the system to emerge in newly upgraded status. When you do something like that there&#39;s a lot of faith you have to have that the people who put together the shiny DVD got every last thing right, that they didn&#39;t forget to check some bit somewhere which in your case would turn your computer into a puddle of slag. I know that at some level it&#39;s an irrational fear, yet I&#39;ve bricked my share of hardware in my time and I&#39;ve known the process of operating system upgrades to involve long late-night patching sessions to get everything to work.
</p>
<p>
There was no puddle of slag at the end of my upgrade, just a computer that looked about the same as it did before with no huge obvious changes, just a few cosmetic bits and the promise of future compatibility.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m told that the typical Android phone that&#39;s sold never gets an operating system upgrade from the vendor, and that the usual upgrade path is either to install a completely unsupported hacked up new software load or to scrap the phone and start afresh with new hardware. I haven&#39;t lived in that world yet so I don&#39;t have the experience of others to go through, just the general sense that unless you&#39;re willing to delve into the details of <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogenmod</a> that you should be prepared to get a new phone every time your contract runs out.
</p>
<p>
Compared to operating system upgrades, application upgrades are relatively easy and low worry. With most consumer software that&#39;s going through a rev cycle, these days you select &quot;upgrade&quot; from within the app and it magically replaces itself with a slightly newer version. This time I needed to update Chrome, and <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1367288">I had to descend to the operating system and delete one file</a> to make the automated process work just fine.
</p>
<p>
The other task in my grand system upgrade effort has been to try to get <a href="http://bluestacks.com/">BlueStacks</a> running. This is an app that runs Android apps on Mac OS X. It&#39;s in beta, so I have some reason to understand when things don&#39;t go instantly right, but I tried it out anyway and the install failed to come up with a working system within the amount of time I was willing to throw at it.
</p>
<p>
Just because I have part of a 10.6 upgrade done doesn&#39;t mean that the whole thing is ready. The CD ships with 10.6.3, and you have to download a gigabyte-plus combo update to get to 10.6.8. The first time I did this the download was corrupted (?) so I tried  again with success. I don&#39;t understand why, just enough to hit the &quot;yes&quot; button, and to type the error message exactly into Google when the error happens in the hopes that someone else has seen exactly the same problem.
</p>
<p>
What did we do before error messages could be looked up with such precision? Well, for one thing, there was usually some source code lying around so that you could read just what the context was for the error. If there was no source code to be had, then Usenet was sure to have someone who had seen the same failure mode. Google searching for failures just distributes out the task to a broader audience than ever, but there&#39;s still the basic issue that when something goes wrong you have to rely on the goodness of people who are willing to air their systems difficulties in public in the hopes of righting them again.
</p>
<p>
Keeping a system running with current software is an ongoing job. I ended up only being able to do it after digging through a rats-nest tangle of cables in my basement, emerging victorious with a Firewire cable that allowed me to back up the Mac to the point where I was confident enough that I could insert the DVD, click &quot;Yes&quot;, and hope that someone in Cupertino tested every combination of equipment that one single updater was supposed to work on.
</p>

This is very similar to the kinds of other daily projects I have been involved in like various <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/walker_tracker_.html" target="_self">pedometer games</a> with goals of daily walking activity or language learning that prompts you for daily use.
<p>
Working on something every single day is hard. There are only so many hours in a day, and the commitment to do one thing at the exclusion of something else is a big one. This gives system designers an extra challenge - they need not only to engage you while you&#39;re working on the system, but also to give you enough fond memories of the system while you&#39;re away from it that you&#39;ll voluntarily come back to it day after day.
</p>
<p>
Part of the challenge is to minimize the friction involved in getting back to something day after day. If you have to go through an elaborate login sequence, it will be all that much harder to want to get involved. Any time wasted in the process is not just a few extra seconds one time but a daily commitment to spend that time, over and over again. Good daily systems have a minimum of rough edges and very little to get in the way of that habit.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an element of gaming in 750 words, the process of accumulating a score and badges that reflect progress that can only be achieved over a long period of daily commitment. Until you get three days in a row in, your system icon is an unformed egg, and the number of people who stay in egg state and never graduate to the next level (a turkey) is substantial. As you grow through the effort of daily activity there are opportunities to decorate your account with more and more bling, status markers that give everyone else a chance to recognize you and distinguish your account from all of the others.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, one good way to get added status is to pay for it. Gaming a system quickly leads to monetizing it, since you have a social feedback mechanism that allows people to recognize not just diligence as a sign of their specialness but also the willingness to shake loose some coin in appreciation. So the pattern is simple: build a game that you play for a few minutes each day, reward frequent players with visible signs of their progress, and encourage the devoted ones to add an additional reward that&#39;s easy to purchase and distinctively visible.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been motivated by online games before, but then got to the point where I had to give up on them because the time commitment wasn&#39;t worth the effort spent getting bits of online flair. I appreciated the feedback and liked leveling up but just couldn&#39;t commit beyond a certain level to care more about the whole thing. <a href="http://duolingo.com/#!/vielmetti" target="_self">DuoLingo</a>, for instance, was great for a while (and I got to level 11 in German, woo) but at some point it got to be too much.</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/07/23/mooc-drop-out/" target="_self">dropout</a> in massively online open courses (MOOCs, as they are called). Hundreds of thousands of people will start something, but only a few thousand will finish. It&#39;s very easy to start a multi-day project, but the commitment to come back day after day to finish it is an order of magnitude more exceptional.
</p>
<p>
The alternative to games within systems as a method for reinforcement is to use external rewards from other people. Linda Diane Feldt has talked about how wonderful it is to have used the Android app <a href="http://www.noom.com/cardiotrainer/about.php" target="_self">CardioTrainer</a> to log her workouts. It simply keeps a record of what you have done and records it to Facebook, and doesn&#39;t appear to have an internally exceptional set of elaborate games to prompt you along. What the Facebook connection offers is an opportunity for other people to provide intermittent reinforcement, the random and unexpected &quot;yay&quot; for a good workout that isn&#39;t pre-programmed into the system but comes heartfelt from other people.
</p>
<p>
This is only my second day into 750 words, and I&#39;m not yet at a point to judge it. I like accumulating points as much as anyone, and I like that I can spend a small chunk of time writing instead of playing some other online game and that the result of the effort will be tracked and calculated and commented on favorably, at least by a machine. From time to time I expect to cut and paste these lovely long essays into my weblog after they get a round of edits, and it&#39;s from that effort that I look for the intermittent reinforcement that will most likely keep me going - not that the &quot;turkey&quot; badge isn&#39;t motivating to get through the first week, just that in the long haul the real rewards come from other people.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://750words.com">This system has you writing 750 words each day.
</a>
<p>
I&#39;ve already written 750 words today, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750-words-on-blogging-memory-and-forgetting-ive-been-blogging-for-a-long-time-and-writing-online-for-longer-than-that-27.html" target="_self">a long essay on blogging, forgetting, and remembrance</a>. It was pretty good, and I was pretty happy with it. At one point it was 830 words but I cut it down to size, removing a paragraph and tightening up a few phrases.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the 750 words site is to get you into a habit of writing that many words each and every day. It&#39;s not necessary to publish them, but simply to get them down onto the screen. The technique is similar to the &quot;<a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/" target="_self">morning pages</a>&quot; of The Artist&#39;s Way, but instead of pen and paper you type. By typing for long enough you get over the initial hurdle of getting anything down and instead start to get into a groove of reflection, introspection, creativity and insight. Or so that&#39;s the thought.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not certain that I can keep up with this over the long haul, but it&#39;s an appealing construct to have a simple-minded goal that&#39;s more productive than the alternative of playing solitaire, Flood It, or Sudoku. A Sudoku game eats up 20 minutes, which should be enough time to crank out most of a 750 word essay.
</p>
<p>
Hitting a precise word count improves my prose. I write something that&#39;s too long, and then use some extra time to omit needless words until the total is the correct size. &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/01/fill_the_input_.html" target="_self">Fill the input box exactly</a>&quot; is the mantra, and it serves two masters. First, it allows you to write quickly knowing full well that there will be words to cut when you&#39;re done. Second, it keeps the editorial role in abeyance until the whole piece has been worked to the end. It&#39;s better to cut words only when there are too many of them.
</p>
<p>
The 750 Words writing environment is spare. There&#39;s no formatting, no linking, no permalinks to worry about and no readers. It&#39;s just you on the page, typing away madly with the word count goal at the bottom right hand corner. Writer&#39;s block is the only barrier, and since there&#39;s no expectation of publication it doesn&#39;t even have to come out precisely right. Just keep typing until you are done with filling up the box.
</p>
<p>
I started to try to write an index to Vacuum as an exercise in organization, and what I found was that the tools I have for rereading the that text are too weak. What I really want to do is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/back_up.html" target="_self">download the whole stinking mess</a> and put it into some kind of file system that I can grep through. What words did I use, and when? Have I usefully repeated myself? Is there some clever phrase that gets used too much? All of that is easy enough to construct with the right text analysis environment, but very hard with just Google&#39;s searching tools at my disposal.
</p>
<p>
Organizing a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a>, especially an exceptionally varied one, is very hard work. I have a shelf full of paper notebooks dating back to the 1990s with words in them that perhaps deserve to be unearthed and reanimated for the net, but it&#39;s so hard to know without a very laborious process of reading through them one page at a time, puzzling out the inscriptions and deciding which would have been better forgotten. I know there&#39;s interesting work there mixed in with the sketches and the odd lists of people to call.</p>
<p>Twenty words to go.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, <a href="http://750words.com" target="_self">750 words</a> is a system which encourages you to write 750 words of disposable throwaway prose every day. If it turns out that you can reuse some of it, so much the better! I think this essay might have about 400 useful words in it, and I&#39;ll try to pull them out for Vacuum.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I ended up throwing away two whole paragraphs from the original edit of this essay, so the word count is only about 650. The time to edit the whole thing was almost as long as the time to write it.</p>

      <p>750 words on blogging, memory and forgetting</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently.</p>
<p>With over 2,000 posts in this Typepad installation I started to try to do an index. My writing here was ranged from recipes for semolina pudding to weather maps of Australia to accounts of a peanut processing plant in Texas. No single index is going to make any sense for all of that.</p>
<p>Even though I&#39;ve read a lot, and written a lot, I&#39;ve most likely forgetten most of what I&#39;ve ever written down. The temporary focus on a temporary enthusiasm carries through for a while and then gets discarded, saved but not readily at hand. After years of cumulative writing, what&#39;s there is not a single coherent whole ready to be sculpted into a neat linear narrative, but instead the sometimes interesting and sometimes fragmentary open notebook of a life lived near the keyboard.</p>
<p>Does writing help the memory? Certainly by writing things down you can cause them to be pinned down into a single tangible format that can be referred to later, and if you refer back to them often enough the transient interest becomes something concrete. There&#39;s a lot to be said for putting words down on paper so that they can be edited and refined so that there&#39;s something very particular that they say.</p>
<p>What is our memory these days? With the ubiquity of the Google and its all-seeing maw fed with the writings of our time, the strategy to memorize something may simply be to write it down in a place where it can be Googled and then search to refer back to it when it&#39;s needed.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Google’s maw is infinite and it will undoubtedly attempt someday to put every book ever written in every language into its digital coffers. - <a href="http://warrenadler.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-to-rescue.html" target="_self">Warren Adler</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeding Google is hardly a part-time task, and I feel a need to feed Twitter which is equally hungry to capture the short form version of contemporary accounts of our existence. Twitter is threatening to disgorge for our own personal use the collected record of our Twitter stream - every sandwich you ever ate, every time you complained about squeaky brakes on the bus, every poorly edited grumpy text mashed into the input box - and somehow certainly that will enter our personal memory space as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This process of accumulating digital reminders of what we once experienced is occasionally punctuated by digital loss. There&#39;s the sudden catastrophic loss of the online system that dies with your words left stranded on it, or the hard drive that craters before all of the backups are done. There&#39;s also the slow loss of unfindability where the words or pictures still are somewhere, but you&#39;ve forgotten the magic incantation that will bring them onto the screen. I&#39;ve stranded some text of my own creation, hidden in the grand archives of the University, inaccessible to me or to anyone else because they are student records and thus off limits because of FERPA. No matter, I have remembered a few of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pop tarts and auto parts. - Michael Joyce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every once in a long time, the words that you wrote long ago resurface. I wrote to Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 asking about home page design, and our correspondence was recently <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/home-page-design-advice-from-october-1991-3-months-after-the-webs-public-debut/266380/" target="_self">quoted in The Atlantic online.</a>&#0160;Aside from proving that I was there way back when, it reminded me that finding things online is an ongoing struggle, and that our puny screens and keyboards routinely fail us when looking for the answer to a complicated problem or to give us access to what we know is not very far away. The particular question was on home page design, and I know little more about it now than I did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>By writing I remember, and I throw a few more words into the big soup that try to draw on from time to time to recall what I am and what I know. I&#39;ve forgetten more than I&#39;ve ever remembered, and it&#39;s good to go rummaging through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a> to see what can be unearthed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people.</p>
<p>In addition to ubiquity and focus, I&#39;d like to suggest a third axis of utility for social media - &quot;isolation&quot;. It&#39;s the notion that you can go somewhere online and do something special that&#39;s unlike anything else on the net, and that because of this the rules that have accreted over time about expected behavior are different.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[2]" />As an example, I have an account on <a href="http://pinterest.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Pinterest">Pinterest</a> that I use nearly exclusively for collecting maps. I don&#39;t follow all of my friends there, and I don&#39;t expect that people will follow me just because they are my friends. Similarly, a few friends have Plurk accounts in a little circle where no one expects that anyone else will read what they write and where there is a decided element of silliness that would not play on Facebook.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[5]" />I think we all need a little corner of the net to call our own. Facebook ranks very low on the isolation scale and so it will not appeal to those who are looking for a quiet corner to express themselves. A lightly trafficked wiki, your own blog, or the carefully walled off corner of an interest-specific forum can all have that isolation factor that lets us be sociable but not to the entire world all at once.</p>

Part of the news that gets circulated is information about power outages, in the form of calls for linemen to work at utility companies. In the current storm (&quot;Euclid&quot; as the Weather Channel dubs it) one item has a litany of places that people are either heading to or working from. Happily, they linked to my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage map collection</a> and I&#39;m getting some hits from that.</p>
