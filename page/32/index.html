        <p>North Quad at the U of Michigan had a flood today, causing classes to be cancelled and students to be evacuated from their rooms. There is no estimate of the damage at this time, but it's extensive. The University of Michigan School of Information has a flood information page with reschedule and relocate information for classes and talks.

        <p>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them. Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network. It's OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts.

        <p>Do I understand this? No. But this is a blog called Vacuum, and this is my service to that task. Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-27-from-physorg-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-and-the-fluctuating-speed-of-light/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things. The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down. The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-25-open-every-tab-close-every-tab/">&raquo;</a></p>

The outages mailing list (outages at outages.org) describes itself as follows: The primary goal of this mailing list (&quot;outages&quot;) is for outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-outages-cable-failures-and-postmortems-sources-for-information/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly. The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-being-partially-online-is-worse-than-either-being-online-or-being-offline/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time. Both SleepBot (http://mysleepbot.com/) and SleepTime (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone's accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you're not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-two-sleep-tracker-applications-for-android-sleepbot-and-sleeptime/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it. The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-21-onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage/">&raquo;</a></p>
