      </h3>
      <p>(from the ICOS mailing list)</p><p>Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common<br />
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.</p><p><a href="http://icos.cms.si.umich.edu/sites/icos.cms.si.umich.edu/files/Espeland.pdf">The Discipline of Rankings: 
Public Measures, Decoupling, and Organizational Change (PDF)</a></p><p>Michael Sauder 
University of Iowa 
 
<br /><a href="http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/espeland/home.html">Wendy Espeland 
Northwestern University </a></p><p>This article demonstrates the value of Foucault‟s conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault‟s 
depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings 
change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This 
approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the 
prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the 
external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to 
buffer or hide some activities. Members‟ tendency to internalize these pressures, to 
become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that 
rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and 
by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of 
performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional 
environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a 
crucial task for scholars.

      <p><a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com/2008/10/7-random-food-facts.html">Inspired by Kate from Four Obsessions, here are seven food-related things to share.</a></p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&#0160; If you&#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&#39;ll understand.&#0160; Locally this means that the first day of <a href="http://google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+blueberries">blueberry</a>, raspberry, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/juneberry/">juneberry</a>, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</p><p>2.&#0160; When I was a kid we made cookies out of acorns once.&#0160; It took a long time to gather them, and a lot of work to process them, and when they finally got into the oven somehow (mysteriously) they got scorched.&#0160; I&#39;ve never had the need to repeat that experience.</p><p>3.&#0160; The first complicated recipe I tried was <a href="http://amasci.com/amateur/sciamdx.html">sauce Bearnaise, using a recipe from Scientific American&#39;s The Amateur Scientist (1979 Dec, pg 178; 1981 Jan, pg 164).&#0160;</a>&#0160; It turned out pretty well.</p><p>4.&#0160; After having had <a href="http://williamtozier.com/slurry/2008/09/16/winter-squash-caramel">sweet dumpling squash</a>, I can&#39;t go back to ever eating acorn squash again.</p><p>5.&#0160; We are vegetarians at home, but I&#39;m a confirmed omnivore, and so you&#39;ll see restaurant reviews of meat dishes but only vegetarian recipes.</p><p>6.&#0160; I&#39;m bad at doing recipes because I hardly ever measure anything anymore - mostly I spice things by eye and smell, and as often as not the recipes I end up with are a description of what I did this one time with the food on hand and not instructions for what to go buy.&#0160;&#0160; I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some recipe vocabulary in some language that I&#39;m missing which could make them better, other than &quot;cook until it smells good&quot;.</p><p>7.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken to blogging recipes in part because it&#39;s a convenient way to look them up the next time I need to cook them, since I don&#39;t always know which cookbook on our shelf has the recipe on the menu plan for the week. </p><p>Tag: <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/10/jimmy-wales-gro.html">Jim Benson (e.g. &quot;stir-fried wikipedia with pimentoes&quot;)</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com/2008/02/paczki-day-tomo.html">KitchenChick (my reliable source for Paczki Day information)</a>, and The Cottage Smallholder (who <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=855">got tagged already</a>)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is not medical advice; you refer to more trusted sources than blog postings for health care.</p><p>That said, I&#39;m taking some notes to share.</p><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm">Hand Food and Mouth Disease, from the Center for Disease Control</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with
foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of
cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not
related—they are caused by different viruses. Humans do not get the
animal disease, and animals do not get the human disease.<br /></div><br /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Treatment and Medical Management </strong></h3>
   <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>
     <p> There is no specific treatment for HFMD. </p>
    </li>
<li>
     <p> Symptoms can be treated to provide relief from pain from mouth sores and from fever and aches:     </p>

<pre><code> &lt;ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><li>
       <p> Fever can be treated with antipyretics (drugs that reduce fevers). </p>
      </li>
<li>
        <p> Pain can be treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other over-the-counter pain relievers. </p>
       </li>
<li>
        <p> Mouthwashes or sprays that numb pain can be used to lessen mouth pain. </p>
       </li>
</ul>
    </li>
<li>
Fluid intake should be enough to prevent dehydration (lack of body
fluids). If moderate-to-severe dehydration develops, it can be treated
medically by giving fluids through the veins. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="minusOne">
<p>There is no specific treatment for the infection other than relief of symptoms.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibiotics is not effective, and is not indicated.
Over-the-counter medicines, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) can be used
to treat fever. Aspirin should not be used in viral illnesses in
children under age 12 years.</p>
<p>Salt water mouth rinses (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon of salt to 1 glass of warm
water) may be soothing if the child is able to rinse without
swallowing. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids. Extra fluid is
needed when a fever is present. The best fluids are cold milk products.
Many children refuse juices and sodas because their acid content causes
burning pain in the ulcers.</p>

If you&#39;re an expert on a neighborhood, then you can be pretty sure that someone will find what you write about that neighborhood.</p><p>Neighborhood: once a month send a postcard to a neighborhood, once a month write a blog post with statistics for that market, point the postcard to the link to the blog and tell people where to go to look.</p><p>How to get started:</p><p>Read - subscribe in rss reader (overflowing), figure out how it&#39;s done<br />Comments - when you start you might not get any comments; you will grow as a writer</p><p>When you write it&#39;s hard work - two hours to write a good post about a subdivision or golf course.&#0160; </p><p><strong>What to write about:</strong></p><p><br />* about the communities<br />* about events in the area<br />* about real estate situations<br />* about your market<br />* about a closing<br />* share your listings<br />* answer questions that buyers and sellers ask you<br />* anything and everything<br />* interview people</p><p>Right now there&#39;s a lot of open spaces - you will be found.&#0160;

This approach is particularly useful to understand the day-to-day social and material practices of calculation. Ethnography places the researcher in the same uncertain position as his or her subjects, thereby avoiding the danger of underestimating uncertainty (Agar 1986; Spradley 1979). Its emphasis on practice taps into the actual solutions developed by the users, as opposed to those intended by the designer of the system (Orlikowski 1992; Barley 1986). Our study spans three years of observations at the equity derivatives trading room of pseudonymous International Securities, a large global investment bank with American headquarters on Wall Street. From this period, we selected a single morning of trading at the merger arbitrage desk. The combination of two years of observation with one full morning of data provides a high-frequency, highly contextualized account, in line with the literature in cognitive <br />science and distributed cognition (Hutchins 1995; Hutchins and Klausen 1992).&#0160;&#0160; </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-automark-proble/">Automark problems - how to test, anticipate, and fix</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every year when I vote I use the Automark machines, which are designed for voters needing assistive voting technology at the polls.&nbsp; At my polling place I seem to be the only person who ever uses them, so this is some way to do my bit of public service.</p>

<p>The last few times I have gone through this there have been problems.&nbsp; The first time, I gave up and voted on a regular machine; the second time, I figured things out in time to vote with it.&nbsp; This time I'm going to get it right (I hope).</p>

<p>A recap of problems from previous times:</p>

<p>from May 2008, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">Automark voting issues:</a></p><blockquote><p>I got to the polling place a little bit earlier this time and tried
it again. It misbehaved the same way, but this time there was time to
figure it out, so the poll workers called in their expert who drove
over to help figure it out. The solution ended up to be very simple:
the detachable stub on the ballot must be detached before putting the
ballot into the machine, despite the very clear instructions on that
stub not to detach it, and with no visible instructions to detach it
anywhere on the AutoMARK machine.</p>

<p>I was able to find with some digging an <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ElectionDayGuide_174575_7.pdf">AutoMARK Troubleshooting Guide</a>,
which mentions two possible solutions: either remove the stub before
putting the ballot into the machine, or program the machine to
recognize the stub. I don't know whether this stub length programming
is possible with the ballots we are using.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the ballot has a stub, 
the stub length may not 
have been entered into the 
election setup information.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the system did work with the sample ballot tested by the
poll workers - but the sample ballot did not have a stub at the top! </p></blockquote><p>Listing municipalties that are new to using AutoMARK is a huge catalog - this is just this season's clipping report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/10/21/optical_scan_voting_machines_t.aspx">Centre County, Pennsylvania (Penn State)</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Joyce McKinley, director of elections for Centre County, said voters
shouldn't have any problems with the optical scan machines unless they
overvote or undervote. </p>

<p>Overvoting happens if the voter has chosen more candidates than
allowed, and undervoting is when voters choose fewer candidates than
allowed. In those instances, voters can choose to have the ballot
returned to them or accept the ballot as it is, McKinley said.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/30600929.html">South Bend (St. Joseph County), Indiana (Notre Dame)</a> (WSBT)</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We don't know for sure that those votes are counted,&quot; said Indiana
University-South Bend Political Science Professor Dr. Elizabeth
Bennion. &quot;And, in the case of a close race, it would be very difficult
to do any kind of a recount. So, I think there is real reason for
concern.&quot;</p>

<p>That &quot;touch screen&quot; technology is used to
&quot;automark&quot; specialized ballots filled out by those with special needs
in St. Joseph County. But the actual ballots aren't tallied or counted
until the paper ballot marked by the machine is fed into the same
optical scanner used by all other voters, said St. Joseph County Clerk
Rita Glenn.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyitemoflynn.com/articles/2008/10/06/news/news07.txt">Saugus, MA</a> (The Daily Item, Lynn MA)</p><blockquote><p><span class="content">SAUGUS-This November, the town will once again
set out AutoMARK Voter Assist Terminals at each polling place and, this
time, Town Clerk Joanne Rappa hopes someone other than the poll workers
will use them.<br /><br />AutoMARK terminals allow voters with just about
any kind of handicap to cast their vote unaided in the polling
locations just like every other voter. The problem, Rappa said, is
while the town has had the machines since 2007 no one uses them. She
said she suspects they go unused for one of two reasons, people aren’t
aware the machines are available or don’t know how to use them.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.kxmc.com/News/279909.asp"><span class="content">South Dakota (KXMC via AP)</span></a></p><blockquote><p>YANKTON, S.D. (AP)&nbsp; Secretary of State Chris Nelson says a
problem that cropped up with touch-screen voting machines in the
2006 election won't recur this year.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;States must have at least one touch-screen machine in each
polling place so people with visual or other disabilities can cast
their own ballot in secret.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a class="kxInlineLink" href="http://www.kxmc.com/t/south-dakota" title="Click here to view all related stories">South Dakota</a>'s AutoMARK machines merely mark a paper ballot that
people review after they vote to ensure its accuracy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nelson says there was a problem with the 17-inch-long ballots
that were used in 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This year, the ballots are 14 inches long, and Nelson says the
problem won't happen again.</p></blockquote><p>As always, vote early, and vote often.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-what-exactly-am/">outside.in &#34;top local blog&#34; roundup: what exactly am i writing about here?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>outside.in is a blog aggregator; it scoops up posts from around the net, codes them by geography, and then presents you the reader with a feed that's local to whatever you want it to be local about.&nbsp; <a href="http://outside.in/Ann_Arbor_MI">Here is the outside.in Ann Arbor page</a> .&nbsp; I get their newsletter sent to me which ends up being a good day's local news clippings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outside.in/2008/10/21/dept-of-blogiology-101-ann-arbor/">Here's their roundup of top Ann Arbor blogs and bloggers; Vacuum is listed as a top local blog. </a> They describe what I write about as follows:</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/">Vacuum </a>-
A love of the neighborhood library and awareness of local school news,
political happenings, tech updates and the occasional recipe make this
eclectic blog a must read. </p></blockquote><p>It's always interesting to figure out what other people thing you are doing - if you are trying to maintain a laser-like coherent focus on being eclectic, it's hard to know what to do next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm happy that recipes make for good filler.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, here's perhaps better sources for any of the components that go into this effort:</p>

<p>Libraries: my main library blog is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a> which spun out of Vacuum about two years ago.&nbsp; Locally the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> site has a bunch of blogs inside it including <a href="http://www.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/302">a good one on local history</a>, Globally my short list for library inspiration includes <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">Jenny Levine's The Shifted Librarian</a>, <a href="http://tametheweb.com/">Michael Stephens writing Tame The Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">self-described library geek John Blyberg's eponymous blog.</a></p>

<p>Local school news: the <a href="http://www.burnsparkpto.org/">Burns Park Elementary PTO has a web site and newsletter</a>&nbsp; which I clip from regularly (mostly, it seems, to remind myself of things in the future).&nbsp; The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> has good coverage of school meetings which I am never ever likely to attend regularly.&nbsp; The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arborparents">very busy arborparents mailing list </a>connects parents across town and across the area - more news than I can readily absorb but always something of interest and a very helpful bunch for asking questions of.</p>

<p>Political happenings:&nbsp; I think the outside.in people were keyed on to my elections coverage; rather than take any kind of political stance visibly here at all in any tedious partisan way, I try to always collect <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-michi.html">as much details as I can on elections including sample ballots and polling place locations and times.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The best sources for that are <a href="http://potifos.com/polygon/">county clerk Larry Kestenbaum's occasional blogging</a>, plus a certain degree of digging through municipal web sites.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/services/Pages/E-mailAlertSubscription.aspx">City of Ann Arbor's email alert service</a> helps a lot.</p>

<p>Tech updates: This leaves broad room for interpretation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the useful but sometimes tedious realm, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme is the only tech news tracker you need to listen to the silicon valley echo chamber</a>.&nbsp; Collecting more local tech news is helped by<a href="http://concentratemedia.com/"> Issue Media Group's Concentrate</a> and by <a href="http://www.wwj.com/pages/317228.php">Matt Roush's Great Lakes IT Report</a>, both of which are eager to write about local stuff.&nbsp; My <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 weekly lunch group and the mailing list that goes with it</a> are my local collection source for interesting people and projects and tech (and note that quite a bit of this is pre-market projects not yet in the Silicon Valley radar).</p>

<p>The occasional recipe: The relentlessly practical answer to how this gets done is &quot;blog what you eat&quot;; if you are persistent about that, you get ready-made menu plans for next year around the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, I turn to <a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com">Kate Remen-Wait's Four Obsessions blog</a> when I need a menu idea,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com">Kitchenchick for reviews of local restaurants</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefarmersmarketer.com/">The Farmer's Marketer for a market list from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a>.&nbsp; Globally the technique is &quot;google cooking&quot; or &quot;twitter cooking&quot; where you simply type in a list of ingredients into either search box and hope someone has something inspiring. </p>

<p>Eclectica.&nbsp; It's imporant to be fed a steady diet of things which are interesting; if <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/creativity_is_a.html">creativity is an import-export game</a>, then this is the import side of that.&nbsp; Reliably I pull from<a href="http://delicious.com/network/vielmetti"> my network on delicious</a> for great weird ideas.&nbsp; There are a few weblogs that specialize in the eclectic, most notably <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/">Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets: A Compendium of Eclectica for Epopts.</a></p>

<p>so there you go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some notes from the publisher's sites on new(ish) books on programming a web 2.0 world.&nbsp; Just remember, &quot;every day computers are making people easier and easier to use.&quot;</p>
<p>Programming Collective Intelligence, 1st Edition by Toby Segaran</p>
<blockquote><p>
Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application.

<p>Collective Intelligence in Action, Satnam Alag</p>
<blockquote><p>
Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.

This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.

<p>Algorithms of the Intelligent Web, Haralambos Marmanis with Dmitry Babenko</p>
<blockquote><p>
Web 2.0 applications are best known for providing a rich user experience, but the parts you can't see are just as important—and impressive. Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.

Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.

<p>Of course, if you're going to read code about the intelligent web, it would serve you well to read some fiction first so that you can get your frame of reference right.&nbsp; I'd recommend Snow Crash as a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-14-scrambled-eggs/">Scrambled eggs with slow roasted tomatoes (炒鸡蛋西红柿)</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I did the slow roasting during high tomato season, and there are a few quarts of them in the freezer.</p>

<p>Wondering which recipes would show up for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=recipe+egg+tomato">a search for &quot;recipe egg tomato&quot; on Twitter</a>, I ended up much to my surprise on a Beijing travel web site, which had a recipe for Fried Egg and Tomato – <a href="http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/chinese-recipes/egg-and-tomato-chinese-recipe">Chǎo Jīdàn Xīhóngshì – 炒鸡蛋西红柿.</a></p><blockquote><p>Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a
really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every
cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing.</p>

<p>It takes about
five minutes to make and is really straightforward. It’s tasty, but
pretty bland, so it’d probably combine nicely with something spicy, a
vegetable dish and plain rice.</p></blockquote><p>Further searches for 炒鸡蛋西红柿 turned up<a href="http://xiaoyao-home.blogspot.com/2008/06/ingredients-onion-eggs-cooking-oil-salt.html"> this bilingual post with several egg+vegetable recipes:</a> </p><blockquote><p><span lang="ZH-CN" style="font-family: SimSun;">This
is not the technical difficulty of the two dishes, and international
friends to write down the invitation because they only know that onions
can be together steak and roast, scrambled eggs can not know. (tr. Google)</span></p></blockquote><p>So then the principles which can be adapted as you might need them based on what is at hand:</p>

<p>Use roughly equal proportions of eggs and tomatoes.&nbsp; I had roasted tomatoes so they weren't so watery, but you could use fresh.</p>

<ol><li>Chop the onion or garlic and mix with the scrambled eggs.&nbsp; Add to a pan with a generous amount of oil and cook.&nbsp; Think &quot;stir fry&quot;, not &quot;omelet&quot; here.</li>

<li>Remove the eggs from the pan and cook the tomatoes (or peas or green beans or what have you) in the same pan.&nbsp; You might add more of whatever seasoning you are using (garlic e.g.).</li>

<li>When the vegetables are cooked and hot, add the eggs back in, mix, season to taste, and serve.&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>With that as a basic start only your imagination is left to add to the possibilities - this would be good with spring peas, zucchini, red peppers just to think of a few.</p>

<p>--</p>

      </h3>
      <p>some notes for a project that my oldest is doing -</p>

<p><p>from the <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/huntingwildlifehabitat/Landowners_Guide/Species_Mgmt/Bats.htm">Michigan DNR: Landowner&rsquo;s Guide, Bats</a></p><blockquote><p>The <strong> little brown bat</strong> is especially abundant throughout the
state and is the most seen species. A light brown to dark brown in
color, little browns are fairly small in size with a wingspan of 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
to 11 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, small ears, and large feet. In summer, colonies of
the species live in hot attics and under shingles and siding; in
winter, they hibernate in
caves, crevices, houses, hollow trees, or mines. Females form nursery
colonies away from the males. Little brown bats like to feed on aquatic
insects and are frequently seen dipping and diving over water but will
also forage over lawns and pastures, among trees, and under street
lights. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10369-150890--,00.html">DNR: Beneficial Bats Are Nature&rsquo;s Best Bug-Eaters</a></p><blockquote><p></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">There
are in Michigan nine species of bats, and much of what is known about
them comes from studies of the two gregarious (that roost in large
groups) species most commonly found here &ndash; the big brown bat and
little brown bat. Keen&rsquo;s bat is another gregarious species widely
distributed in Michigan, and the tiny eastern pipistrelle is an
uncommon year-round resident of the western Upper Peninsula.</span></span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/wildlife/viewingguide/up/07Bat/index.htm"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">The Millie Mine Bat Viewing Site, Iron Mountain MI</span></span></a></p><blockquote><p>The Millie Mine is a critical hibernating and breeding location for up to 50,000 bats—one of the largest known concentrations of bats in the Midwest. Big brown and little brown bats from all over the region come here to hibernate during the cold winter months. They are believed to migrate in from throughout the Great&nbsp; Lakes region–Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ontario, perhaps even Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Bats start arriving&nbsp; at the mine in late August and early September. They remain in the mine shaft throughout the winter and begin emerging in late April and May. Some use the&nbsp; mine as their permanent home. Most, however, will&nbsp; fly back to their forested home areas to spend the&nbsp; summer where they roost during the day under the bark&nbsp; of dead trees or in other small crevices. The females will typically use large hollow trees, abandoned buildings,&nbsp; or other human structures as maternity roost sites where they raise their young with other females during ; the summer. Males live a separate and more solitary&nbsp; life during this time. </p></blockquote></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ranecurl/mkc/fiborn.html">Fiborn Karst Preserve</a> - a set of limestone caves in an old limestone quarry in Mackinac County, MI:</p><blockquote><p>Both the Little Brown Bat and Keen&rsquo;s
Bat have been found using the caves for swarming or hibernation. Keen&rsquo;s
Bat was most common in the swarming studies. Following the winter of 1978-79
a large number of dead Little Brown Bats were found in Kochab Cave; they
had possibly been trapped by an ice block at the entrance for too long
after they emerged from hibernation. Studies of the bats and other small
mammals are being conducted by scientists from Eastern Michigan University.</p>

<p></p></blockquote><blockquote></p>

<p><p>While the primary significance of the
Fiborn Karst Preserve is geological, the plants and animals of the Preserve
are important components, and their protection is part of the management
objectives. The MKC would welcome further biological studies in the Preserve. </p></blockquote><p>For lots more information, see the <a href="http://www.batcon.org/home/default.asp">Bat Conservation International</a> site.&nbsp; </p><blockquote></blockquote></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~refromsn/tv.html">&quot;Kill your television.&quot;</a>&nbsp; Quoting Robert Efroymson's long since abandoned home page at U Minnesota:</p><blockquote><p>My favorite reason for not watching TV is that it has a fixed, low
bandwidth.&nbsp; You can't watch tv fast or slow, you have to watch it at
the rate the show goes, which could very well be much slower than you
can accept the information (or much faster).&nbsp; A book you can read at
your own pace, a tv show sets the pace for you.
</p>

<p>
The other reason is that I will watch anything.&nbsp; I seem to have no
ability to discriminate between good shows and bad.&nbsp; I learned this
many years ago, when I was an undergraduate.&nbsp; I was visiting some
relatives who had young children.&nbsp; They put a tape of the &quot;Smurfs&quot; in
the VCR for the girls to watch.&nbsp; I could not help watching it myslf.
In fact I can still recall the evil man with his cat who had a plan to
destroy the Smurfs. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-08-twitter-zero/">twitter zero</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I love Twitter - I love being in the flow of the world with the off hand comments of hundreds of friends around the world triggering all sorts of warm feelings and thoughts about how lucky I am to know so many people in so many places.</p>

<p>For that very same reason, I&#39;m working towards getting off Twitter, my &quot;twitter zero&quot; project, where I unfollow everyone I&#39;ve been following.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Twitter Zero is inspired by a few other &quot;zero&quot; projects, including Merlin Mann&#39;s &quot;Inbox Zero&quot; and Alan Gutierrez&#39;s &quot;Reader Zero&quot;.&#0160; The basic idea is that in systems where there is an infinite capacity for the world to send messages to get your attention, the only reasonable queue that you can leave between visits to the system is zero, because if you get behind you will never, ever, ever catch up gradually.&#0160; Never.&#0160; No matter how much time you put into it, there will always be more to do, and you will lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that you say, you love twitter, why make it go away?&#0160; For the same reason that I love weblogs (really I do; you are reading this one) and I don&#39;t read any blogs in a feed reader.&#0160; And I love getting email (really I do) and spend too much of my time ignoring and deleting email.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t keep up.&#0160; No one can keep up, actually - we look at something shiny and say &quot;ooh shiny&quot; and start following it because it was shiny then (and shiny once) and then suddenly you look back a week later and note to self &quot;hm, not shiny any more, but it&#39;s a lot harder to stop paying attention to it once you&#39;re connected to it&quot;.</p>

<p>So, go to zero.&#0160; Turn off Twitter, don&#39;t let it interrupt you any more.&#0160; But still listen.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Twitter is great for ambience awareness of things around the world, perfect actually.&#0160; With the new search interface you can see at a glance when there are earthquakes, what television shows are on, who&#39;s winning what football games, when the Mormon Church is having a global conference, Girl&#39;s Night Out, you name it there&#39;s some super-cool global event that you can tap into without doing much more than a few follows.</p>

<p>Follow follow follow follow...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll argue for the sake of arguing that we as human beings have a finite supply of attention for ambient awareness of things around the world; there&#39;s only so many neurons that can fire in one moment to keep track of what&#39;s happening, and my poor aging brain has some finite ability to keep track. You make tradeoffs, you have to.&#0160; And the fact that I know just a little bit too much about popular television due to twitter has to be responsible for some other deficit in my life, like not getting quite enough sleep, or not cleaning the garage (or even more to the point noticing that there are parts of it that need attention).&#0160; </p>

<p>Or paying attention to my boys.&#0160; They are little.&#0160; They won&#39;t be little forever.&#0160; They don&#39;t use Twitter, yet - yet? - though the older one was asking about connections between the computer and my phone (he seemed to think that Bluetooth would be involved.&#0160; he&#39;s eight.&#0160; how do they do this?)</p>

<p>Attention is a precious resource.&#0160; Twitter is a distraction.&#0160; Email is a distraction.&#0160; This blog is a distraction.&#0160; Pretty much everything is a distraction on the Internet, either designed to capture an eyeball or rewire a neuron or to short circuit the brain to wallet function.&#0160; And sometimes the only reasonable response to a thoroughly enjoyable distraction is to make a very visible, very annoying, very painful decision to skip this particular distraction and move on.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Before inbox zero, before twitter zero, there was Usenet Zero.&#0160; &#0160;One by one, a series of people who had spent a lot of time building up that network made decisions, some private and some noisily public, to give up on that network and go off and build some other network of their own.</p>

<p>Noisy public exits are cathartic - they let you say something that has been building up over time and get it all out of your system, and rather than try to fight the fight of 1000 tiny cuts you simply say &quot;screw it&quot; and let off some steam and disentangle from the world you had been in all at once.&#0160; You go away in a ball of fire and are memorable for your absence, at least for a little while, at least until someone else&#39;s attention span is diverted momentarily into the latest minor earthquake or Digg headline or caribou joke or heart attack rumor.</p>

<p>Giving up on a network is one way to build a new network.&#0160; Who notices when you go?&#0160; Who actually cares?&#0160; Exit stage left (in flames) is more effective at some momentary attention grab than simply quietly receding into the background.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;m giving up on Twitter feeds, I&#39;m not really giving up on Twitter.&#0160; There&#39;s too much there to ignore.&#0160; But I&#39;m changing my approach.</p>

<p>Rather than the passive rat-lever-pellet approach to waiting for an update from a Twitter pal, I&#39;m going to be using the Twitter search tools as the primary point of contact.&#0160; &#0160; This is the &quot;Kibo&quot; strategy.</p>

<p>Kibo?</p>

<p>If you were on Usenet at a certain time, there was someone called Kibo, who was virtually everywhere.&#0160; Every newsgroup you posted in, if someone mentioned his name, he showed up with a comment.&#0160; That was unusual, because who could follow 1400 newsgroups and read everything.&#0160; </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not how Kibo did it, and not how I did the same thing when I ran the Usenet newsgroup comp.archives.&#0160; Instead of following the network by group, you follow it by keyword, and anyone who uses that word or set of words is part of your world.&#0160; For comp.archives, it meant that every time someone typed in the word FTP, I&#39;d find that post, and one time out of ten those were announcements of new software.&#0160; A systematic effort to collect those announcements and repost them and index them followed.</p>

<p>That was hard in the Usenet era (I ended up hacking on emacs lisp to do it) but very easy in the Twitter era, and it&#39;s a better strategy by far.&#0160; If you want to change the things you focus on, you don&#39;t need to add and subtract friends, you just need to modulate your filters.</p>

And maybe that&#39;s the answer: A Facebook app we&#39;ll call the Fade Utility. Untended Friends would gradually display a sepia cast on the picture, a blurring of the neglected profile—perhaps a coffee stain might appear on it or an unrelated phone number or grocery list. The individual&#39;s status updates might fade and get smaller. The user may then choose to notice and reach out to the person in some meaningful way—no pokes! Or they might pretend not to notice. Without making a choice, they could simply let that person go. Would that really be so awful?

<p><p>The World Spider Catalog is a thorough catalog of the scientific literature regarding spiders, with a special attention paid to classification and taxonomy.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The organization of the entries is hierarchically determined; hence synonymies at the
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic level are indicated under the family (and cross-referenced under the appropriate
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic) listings, but affected species are listed separately only if there are significant
&nbsp; &nbsp; references to them in particular. Similarly, synonymies at the species level are listed under
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic, rather than familial, headings. Unlike Roewer and Brignoli, I have not attempted to
&nbsp; &nbsp; segregate species within large genera on a geographic basis. Their listings are often
&nbsp; &nbsp; confusing, with widespread species being hard to locate and easy to overlook. Spider

advances in spider ecology to individual authors who were instrumental
in shaping our current understanding of ecology as a modern science.
The motivation for this paper is to reveal to the ecological community
some of the best early research in the first half of the 20th century
when it is believed that ecological spider experiments really began.
This period has remained elusive to most researchers, because the
majority of ecological literature pre-1970 is not available
electronically and ecological research tends to have a short citation
life-time which rarely extends beyond a decade. For example, there are
two excellent, but very similar experiments on orientation in <a href="http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=all&amp;search_value=Frontinella+communis&amp;search_kingdom=every&amp;search_span=exactly_for&amp;categories=All&amp;source=html&amp;search_credRating=All" target="itis_window"><em>Frontinella communis</em></a> (Hentz 1850) (Linyphiidae).

or those who did the peer review and editing, simply because the
reference was not in general electronic circulation (Robert Suter pers.
comm.). This is not especially embarrassing because for most authors
there has rarely been a need to look deep into the scientific
literature—in fact, ecological journals positively discourage it.</p></blockquote><p>Platnick, N. I. 2008. The world spider catalog, version 9.0. American Museum of Natural

<p><p>from<a href="http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/no_one_meaner/"> Live Design Online, &quot;No One Meaner than a Vacuum Cleaner&quot;</a></p><blockquote><p>The opera (Evil Machines) features wild cars and other evil machines, pitted against
friendly household appliances, including a beautiful egg whisk and the
alarm clock that loves her. Veteran costume designer and Monty Python
movie alum James Acheson had a hand in designing the opening chorus of
six evil vacuum cleaners. The chorus is joined by a 15&rsquo; giant evil
vacuum cleaner, who — with the help of an inflatable body, a fan, and
some CO2 — literally bursts with pride, showering dust and bed bugs over the orchestra and the first few rows of the audience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7180000/newsid_7184500/7184582.stm">The BBC has a video with a Terry Jones interview and some of the dancing vacuums</a> (sorry, can&rsquo;t embed it).</p><blockquote><p>Opera singers appear as giant appliances in Monty Python creator Terry

      </h3>
      <p>in some extremely silly world, here are practical ways to get dressed for Halloween as a vacuum cleaner with attachments.<br /><a href="http://www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com/original-halloween-costumes.html"><br />From &quot;coolest homemade costumes dot com&quot; in their home appliances section:</a></p><blockquote><p>My husband started with an empty box, free from the grocery store
and cut it down to fit her. He then wrapped it in some black vinyl,
attached some parts from old vacuums we had in the garage (handle, hose
and attachment, caddy with brushes). The red Hoover emblem was a piece
of red sticky-backed felt. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The feet (power head) were two
pieces of 4&quot; foam hollowed out, one on each foot for movement. We
decorated them with more red felt displaying 12 amps and aluminum foil
for a headlight. While trick or treating so many people asked her to
clean their houses for fun! </p></blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <p><a href="http://dailypress2.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=8231&amp;si=Vacuum">A red upright Hoover costume for a 3 year old</a> (photo at link)<br /><a href="http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/season/feature/costume_contest_dirt/"><br />Disney's Family Fun has this one, submitted by Julie L of Arglye TX:</a></p><blockquote><p>Made with a black sweatsuit and red felt, the vacuum bag portion of
this costume gets its full shape from newspaper stuffing, while foam
core is used to make the sweeper. Toilet paper rolls painted black and
attached to a knit cap create the handle, and a black cord is the final
touch to the wearable appliance.
</p></blockquote><p>Finally, here's a twist I hadn't expected: rather than you dressing as a vacuum, dress your vacuum (in this case the Roomba robot vacuum) in <a href="http://myroombud.com/roombafrogger.html">a Frogger costume from myRoomBud.</a> </p>

The video commentary:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">Ever
since Phillip Torrone
and Limor Fried played
Roomba Frogger down in
Texas, we wanted to play
it too except we could
not afford to use one
of our Roombas &hellip; so
we hacked a Frogger game
to use one our RoomBud
costume characters, Roobit
the Frog. Well that wasn&rsquo;t
good enough so using a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=3&amp;idproduct=1">RooTooth</a>
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/">RoombaDevTools</a>
for the wireless bluetooth
connection to our computer
and a bit more coding,
we put together a game
that we can play on the
computer and have Roobit
the Frog RoomBud actually
run along the floor doing
the same maneuvers as
the Frogger character.
When you get your little
Roobit across the river,
your Roomba will start
to vacuum!</span></p></blockquote></p>

      </h3>
      <p>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.newsagencyblog.com.au/2008/10/03/calendar-strategy-delivers-results.html">Australian Newsagency Blog<br /><br /></a></p><blockquote><p>Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston.</p>

<p>At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season.</p>

<p>At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously
this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on
a more unique range of titles. We have given over a column at the front
of the store to promote our calendar range as well as to feature a <strong>Calendar of the Week</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually when people talk about a &quot;calendar of the week&quot;, they talk about &quot;a calendar of the next week's events&quot;.&nbsp; Here, we have &quot;an entirely new calendar of the year, so that if you gave up on last week's calendar because you got bored of seeing pictures of fuzzy bunnies, here's a new one of fuzzy kittens.&quot;</p>

<p>Remarkable (and a great idea).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every week on Thursday I host a lunch at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor; you're invited.&nbsp; One regular element of that lunch is helping figure out what events are happening the upcoming weekend and weeks ahead so that people can find help in publicizing those events or tell people about something they are looking forward to.</p>

<p>I've tried a zillion difficult ways to keep the calendar for that group, none of which are ideal, mostly because they involve some kind of calendar system which requires more precision than I have time to deal with and which makes me type things into fields.</p>

<p>The hack (and really it's a hack) for the last few weeks has been to use <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Talk:A2b3">the talk page on the group's page on Arborwiki as a public calendar, </a>or more precisely, to use it for me as a quick place to cut and paste things so that when the time comes I know enough to tell people about that.&nbsp; An interesting advantage to doing it in wiki vs. in a calendar system is that I can hyperlink e.g. the name of a theater to the page for that theater and get (for free) all of the location and venue information along with it.</p>

<p>Is it perfect?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is there some refinement of it which might work better?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Is it handy?&nbsp; You bet.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Frisinger_Park">Frisinger Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A few picnic tables near the playground with lots of things to do for
kids (slides, swings, a merry-go-round, a sandbox) and a big field to run in. Shady for
those hot days. Avoid it on football Saturdays. Free.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Gallup_Park">Gallup Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A dock on the Huron River is perfect for a party where the kids go fishing. (worms work great).&nbsp; There's a snack bar with coffee for the adults, and a play area with lots of things to climb and bounce on.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; Get your fishing license online with the <a href="http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp">Michigan DNR E-License.</a></p>

<p>3.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.exhibits.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/publicprogrms/planetarium/">Exhibit Museum Planetarium</a> (indoors).&nbsp; They're closed as of this writing, preparing to install a new all-digital projection system; sign up for their mailing list to find out more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>4.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_Firehouse_Museum">Michigan Firehouse Museum</a>, Ypsilanti (indoors).&nbsp; Old fire engines are the draw in this museum located in an old fire house near Ypsi's Depot Town.&nbsp; </p>

<p>5.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jiffy_Mix">Jiffy Mix factory tour</a>, Chelsea (indoors).&nbsp; Tour the factory, see how Jiffy Mix is made.&nbsp; Age 6 and up, tours Mon-Fri, so it's probably a summer time event or a holiday event.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Southern_Michigan_Railroad_Society">Southern Michigan Railroad Society,</a> Clinton MI.&nbsp; Museum train runs from Clinton to Tecumseh on the old Jacksonburgh and Palymra track; there's a museum in Clinton with old railroad stuff on the main floor and a working shop downstairs for repair of their rolling stock.&nbsp; Call them to see how they handle groups.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem's_Fruit_Farm">Wasem's Fruit Farm</a>, Milan MI.&nbsp; Take the crew out for apple picking or pumpkin picking, watch the donut robot make delicious <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Donuts">donuts.</a>&nbsp; Call ahead to see if they will be making cider, they don't always do it on busy weekends.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Cider_Mill">Dexter Cider Mill</a>, Dexter MI.&nbsp; No apples to pick here - they bring them in - but a great old cider press in the basement of this old mill on the Huron River.&nbsp; Again, donuts.&nbsp; (Mmm, donuts.)&nbsp; Watch for flying insects!</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ray_Fisher_Stadium">Ray Fisher Stadium</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Take the team to a University of Michigan baseball game during the spring season.&nbsp; </p>

<p><p>10.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Yost_Ice_Arena">Yost Ice Arena</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Look for wintertime open skate times.</p><br /></p>

      <p>Here's a review of what people were looking for to find this weblog in previous Octobers.&nbsp; Some of this tells me what I should write about this year, and other parts of it tell me what fads came and went.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+trick+or+treat+hours">Ann Arbor trick or treat hours (search)</a>: Every year I try to post a complete list of trick or treat hours for the area; here's the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/halloween_trick.htm">2005,</a> <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/halloween_trick.html">2006,</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/halloween-trick.html ">2007</a> lists.&nbsp; This year if I'm ambitious I'll try to get a list of any special events by neighborhood.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders">Michigan spiders (search</a>): One of the most popular October pages is a writeup I did on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/brown_recluse_s.html ">the brown recluse spider</a> two years ago; a recent one on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/pumpkin-spider.html">the pumpkin spider</a> should be good too.&nbsp; It's not a coincidence that spiders are part of Halloween decorations!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=noguchi+filing+system">Noguchi filing system (search):</a>&nbsp; In October 2005 I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/noguchi_filing_.html ">Noguchi filing system</a>, a time-centered approach to filing and memory by a Japanese economist that William Lise had described on his translation web site.&nbsp; Interest spiked ever so briefly in August 2006.&nbsp; Subsequently Lise pulled his excellent descriptive text from the net in response to piracy of his text.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.noguchi.co.jp/">The Yukio Noguchi web site is all in Japanese</a> but may help in some way to help you reconstruct this system from his original works describing it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=laszlo+bock">Laszlo Bock, Google (search):</a> In October 2006, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/laszlo_bock_goo.html ">Laszlo Bock was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal</a> about changes to the hiring process at Google, describing a system that was going to be more heavily quantified and measured than before.&nbsp; Interest in that clip peaked Jan 2007 and has been consistent.&nbsp; A further <a href="http://mba.yale.edu/news_events/CMS/Articles/6352.shtml">interview with Bock by the Yale School of Management</a> gives few additional insights, but this interesting tidbit: he was an actor in &quot;Showtime kinds of movies&quot;, yet there's no unambiguous credits for him in IMDB.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=book+burro">Book Burro (search):</a> In October 2006, the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/10/book_burro_wins.html">Firefox plugin Book Burro won 2d prize in a mashups for libraries contest organized by OCLC.</a>&nbsp; Book Burro watches web sites when you browse and alerts you to information about books referenced on the page, allowing you with a minimum of keyboard and mouse movement to know whether that book from Amazon is in stock at your local library.&nbsp; I wrote about this as part of some broader set of library focused writing at my other blog, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron.</a></p>

<p>Finally, in October 2005, I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/caribou_coffee_.html">Caribou Coffee opening up down the street</a>.&nbsp; It's still there, and I'm still a regular.&nbsp; mmm coffee...</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-when-did-the-in/">When did the internet go commercial, part two: &#34;buy now&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A follow up on the earlier post about the commercialization of the internet -</p>

<p>Once the basic data infrastructure of the Internet was open to commercial use - which starts in late 1991, and accelerates rapidly from there - you start to get slowly and then at a rapidly accelerating pace the appearance of businesses online who are selling things to people directly.</p>

<p>Some milestones there as well:</p>

<p>1993: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011221102015/www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,299047,00.html">Fry Multimedia launches web sites for Godiva, Ragu</a>; mostly marketing and advertising not sales.<br />December 1993: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n2_v13/ai_16675341/pg_4">Jon Zeeff in Ann Arbor's Branch Mall adds Grant's Flower and Greenhouse for online floral delivery;</a> he gets 40 orders via the Internet for Mother's Day, compared to 45 via FTD.<br />1994: First Virtual Holdings founded; enables internet based credit card payments.<br />July 1995: Amazon.com goes online<br />1995: Netcom, an Internet service provider, loses 20000 credit card numbers to online hackers.</p>

<p>The tipping point in retrospect is when people are willing to type their credit card numbers into web sites to order products.&nbsp; First Virtual was built on the assumption that you needed new infrastructure because card numbers were so risky; Amazon could launch without that assumption a year and some later and cope with shy buyers by providing alternate methods for getting card numbers to the system.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-gno-organizing/">#gno: organizing a network-wide chat on twitter</a>
      </h3>
      <p>#gno stands for &quot;Girl's Night Out&quot;.&nbsp; It's trending right now on search.twitter.com.&nbsp; (Yes I am up late; but this is fascinating, I've never seen this particular behavior on twitter before.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see topics trend on search.twitter.com when there are a lot of hipster people in some hipster city at some hipster tech conference.&nbsp; A zillion people who are all mostly in the same building will use the same tag to post comments on the event.&nbsp; At this point that's &quot;ordinary&quot;.</p>

<p>#gno is different - it's a virtual event, <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/search/label/twitter%20GNO">synchronized in time and organized by this loosely affiliated collection of what are charmingly called these days &quot;mommybloggers&quot;.</a>&nbsp; The time sync is important, so that everyone is on the same page, but not everyone knows each other or follows each other on twitter.&nbsp; This made their first couple of rounds of attempts somewhat frustrating.</p>

<p>The new go-around though seems to be catching on enough that it's a #1 hit (in the twitter universe of 15 minutes of fame), even outpacing the LA earthquake (3.0 magnitude) and perpetual favorite Sarah Palin.&nbsp; How did they do it?</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Loosely coupled networks - blog networks - where there are lots of people linking to each other.&nbsp; If you had been part of this network you would have known about it from multiple sources.&nbsp; Like a lot of internet ideas, one way to spread it is to <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/2008/09/first-evah-twitter-gno.html">link to all the people who are part of it (example here)</a> and get them to reciprocate.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Tightly synchronized timing - a twitter schedule - where lots of people are asked to show up at a particular time.&nbsp; The time is key; if you say &quot;some time tonight&quot; you'll get a lot less peak time traffic than if you say &quot;11pm Eastern on the dot&quot;.&nbsp; And while lots of traffic over a long time is interesting, peak traffic is what makes you visible outside your bubble.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; A willingness to iterate on tools.&nbsp; To make this work you need to set some guidelines so that new people joining the network have a recipe to follow to let them be part of it; at the same time, you need to be prepared to switch that recipe from week to week to make it work better or if the tools themselves change.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Someone to be a (nominal or actual) leader who can count noses, decide things, set the network into motion, collect people who are at the fringe and welcome them in, and post the results to improve next time you do it.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp; Low risk cost of entry into the world (all you have to do is type this tag) and access to a user population who is willing to experiment once on something.</p>

<p>Pretty neat, replicable I suppose.&nbsp; You should be able to draw parallels from ham radio, where DX contests get a lot of people on the air at once.&nbsp; There's a similar effect during University of Michigan football games, where when &quot;Michigan&quot; starts to trend you can count on finding other alumni and fans from around the world tuning in.&nbsp; Television shows synchronize people remarkably well (almost terrifying how well).</p>

<p>More from an earlier post: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/11/what-does-mean-.html">What does # mean on Twitter? All about octothorpetags. </a>which I wrote in November 2007 after #sandiegofire.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A friend asks, &quot;when did the Internet go commercial&quot;?&nbsp; Here's something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.</p>

<p>1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds<br />1989: <a href="http://www.std.com/">Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA</a> goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.<br />1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.<br />1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet<br />1991: <a href="http://www.msen.com">MSEN</a> goes online as one of the first commercial ISPs in Michigan.&nbsp; <br />1993: ANS CO+RE joins CIX</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0001.121;view=text#idno_3336451.0001.121">Internet Cost Structures and Interconnection Agreements</a> goes into (too much) details about how the money flows between commerical networks; it is a viewpoint from 1995 of the Internet then.&nbsp; But basically I'd put a date as August 1991 when you could buy an internet connection from one commercial provider and use it to send data to a customer on another commercial provider and not violate any acceptable use politics along the way.</p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>

<p>The simple description of how to deal with it seems to be to smother the affected area (using tarps or old carpets) and to do container gardening on top of that ground cover.&nbsp; (<a href="http://landscaping.about.com/cs/weedsdiseases/a/knotweed_2.htm">ref about.com</a>)</p>

And do a time journal, and if that's really too much effort, just count the number of hours you watch of television in the next week. That's my gift to you.</p>

<p><p>
The last thing is, once you&rsquo;ve got your day-timer, make a note for 30 days from today - it&rsquo;s okay if that one goes &quot;ding&quot; to remind you! - and revisit this talk in 30 days. It will be up on the web, courtesy of Gabe, and ask: &quot;What have I changed?&quot; If I haven&rsquo;t changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you&rsquo;ll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that&rsquo;s important. Time is all we have. And you may find one day you have less than you think. Thank you.</p></blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>From my inbox:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>
with a body about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger
than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my
house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> is only there during evening and night. We think it hides in the bush the rest of the day.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we found it I did a lot of research and I am pretty sure that it is an Araneus trifolium (<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span>, shamrock <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>).
It has the rings around the legs and is the right size. It is in the
right time of year, has the right type of web, and has the right kind
of behavior.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know whether it’s male or female. How do I figure out? Are
Araneus Trifolium poisonous? Are they common where we live? Can you
look at the pictures and figure out if I’m right and it is Araneus
trifolium? (they are attached)</p></blockquote><p>and my response:</p></p>

<p>Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pictures of your <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>.&nbsp; It looks like it is enjoying this time of year!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> spiders are very common this time of year, and they are found all over Michigan.&nbsp; Spiders can be very hard to identify from photos, because there are so many species of them, but it seems that you have made a good identification.<br />
<br />
The reference I'm looking at is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257">http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a><br />
<br />
Shorthouse, David P. submitted. Taxonomic and natural history description of FAM: ARANEIDAE, Araneus trifolium (Hentz, 1847). In: The Nearctic <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span> Database. David P. Shorthouse (editor). World Wide<br />
Web electronic publication. Direct link:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257"> http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a> (Accessed:<br />
9/28/2008 10:55:02 PM).<br />
<br />
which describes both males and females of this species.&nbsp; From that page it seems that females are more often seen later in the season, that they are larger than the males, and that their distinctive leg rings (&quot;annulations&quot;) are more distinctive than the males.&nbsp; So I'm guessing that it's a female, but you<br />
should try to measure its size to compare against that reference.&nbsp; (One way to do that in photos is to put something of known size, like a coin, next to the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> when you photograph it.)<br />
<br />
A second reference is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/11644/bgpage">http://bugguide.net/node/view/<wbr></wbr>11644/bgpage</a><br />
<br />
which is the Bug Guide, which is hosted by Iowa State University Entomology. They have lots of pictures, as well as an identification service.&nbsp; Their photos match up with your photos so you're again probably confirming that identification.<br />
<br />
As to the question of danger from <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites, the Michigan DNR has a page on insects and spiders:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204---,00.html">http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,<wbr></wbr>1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204--<wbr></wbr>-,00.html</a><br />
<br />
which talks about the two known spiders of medical importance in Michigan, the Northern Black Widow and the Brown Recluse.&nbsp; Since it's not one of those, you shouldn't worry about it being dangerous.&nbsp; In fact I searched google for the phrase<br />
<br />
&quot;<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites&quot;<br />
<br />
and got no hits.&nbsp; You might find this search interesting too:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=pumpkin+spider&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">http://www.google.com/trends?<wbr></wbr>q=<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span>+<span class="nfakPe">spider</span>&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=<wbr></wbr>all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0</a><br />
<br />
which shows that people look for <span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> spiders this time of year!</p>

I&rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place
in the time between the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes and their following

buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that
you have enough.</p></blockquote><p>This weekend&rsquo;s project is emptying out bits of the garage that have accumulated reusable leftovers from the summer&rsquo;s kitchen project.&nbsp; We took a couple of windows to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Reuse_Center">Reuse Center on S.

<p>In thinking about how to identify the things that need to go, I'm back to notes I wrote about seiri.&nbsp; The approach here is to use red tags to identify things that don't belong, and then to systematically remove the things that don't belong so that no red tags are left and no new red tags appear.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/48871860/">The most interesting thing I've written about seiri </a>was written on paper, so you can see the scan.&nbsp; I want to go back and do the red tag thing online in some clever way.</p>
