        <p>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them. Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network. It's OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts.

Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-27-from-physorg-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-and-the-fluctuating-speed-of-light/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things. The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down. The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-25-open-every-tab-close-every-tab/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly. The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-being-partially-online-is-worse-than-either-being-online-or-being-offline/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I'm going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time. Both SleepBot (http://mysleepbot.com/) and SleepTime (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone's accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you're not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-two-sleep-tracker-applications-for-android-sleepbot-and-sleeptime/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it. The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-21-onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario. You and your team work hard to use a new piece of collaboration software that offers some unique features that are suited either to the work at hand or that appeal to your sense of novelty. The tool works great and you get into it, using some of the more complex parts of the system to great advantage. Then the system&rsquo;s owners send out the dreaded self-congratulatory message saying that they have been acquired by a big company, or some beleagured product manager announces that their system is being sunsetted. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-18-the-import-export-problem-and-fragile-internet-services/">&raquo;</a></p>

Cendra Lynn is the leader of the organization, and I had some small technological part in starting it back in 1993 when the appropriate technology of the day was Gopher, not the World Wide Web.

        <p>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on http://am1610.org . The show is &quot;The Strait&quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&#39;s always worth a listen.&#0160; Some day I&#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-the-strait-am-1610-the-station-detroit-electronic-vinyl-on-saturday-nights-10-pm-to-midnight/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If my Google Analytics reporting is to be behaved, the peak of Google Reader usage for me was in mid 2008, and by early 2010 it had been reduced to background noise. I can understand based on this graph (and perhaps millions of other graphs like it) that it might be time to call it quits. It looks like from other charts (that I won&#39;t show here) that Twitter picked up the slack, as did Facebook.&#0160; Google&#39;s &quot;sunset&quot; announcement for Google Reader&#0160;says that you can get your data out; I&#39;m sure that at least one service will appear to let you load it in and carry on reading. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-13-ill-miss-google-reader-but-its-no-longer-how-people-read-this-site/">&raquo;</a></p>
