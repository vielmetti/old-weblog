<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The paper is Social Resilience in Online Communities: The Autopsy of Friendster, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109" target="_self">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s math in there which I don&#39;t understand, but this graph seems to sum it up:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b-pi"><img alt="Screen shot 2013-03-02 at 5.43.18 PM" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen shot 2013-03-02 at 5.43.18 PM" /></a><br />The thesis is that if enough of your friends drop off of a service, you will too, because you won&#39;t have anyone to talk to. Then in turn your friends who are left will start to drop off because they miss you and don&#39;t have anyone to talk to, etc.</p>
<p>A 2009 review of the new Friendster interface by a Filipino tech enthusiast, &quot;<a href="http://tech.exchange.ph/blog/animetric/2009/12/07/friendster-gets-a-facelift" target="_self">Friendster gets a facelift</a>&quot; seems to match this:</p>
<p><em>Like most Filipinos online, yes, I have a Friendster account and it was my first attempt at social networking. To be honest though, I have not logged on to my Friendster account in a year. My high school and college friends had all migrated to Facebook, and I found that I could not relate with the Friendster&#39;s younger user base.</em></p>
<p>The question I have is where will the Facebook users migrate to? Techcrunch runs a story that suggests<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/18/tumblr-is-not-what-you-think/" target="_self"> it might be Tumblr next</a>:</p>
<p><em>But Tumblr does not conform to this calculus, and the reason is that a large percentage of Tumblr users actually don’t WANT an audience. They do not want to be found, except by a few close friends who they explicitly share one of their tumblogs with. Therefore Tumblr’s notoriously weak search functionality is A-OK with most of its user base.</em></p>
<p>Time alone will tell.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-02-friendship-fleeting-and-permanent/">Friendship, fleeting and permanent</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m slowly but surely reducing the number of people who I have listed as &quot;friends&quot; on Facebook. That doesn&#39;t mean that I have <span style="text-decoration: line-through; background-color: #ff80bf;">less</span>&#0160;<span style="background-color: #80ffff;">fewer</span>&#0160;&quot;friends&quot;, but just that I&#39;m tiring of reading updates from people who I barely know as though I were a real-life friend of theirs.</p>
<p>This ends up being a slow and tedious task since the user interface doesn&#39;t have an easy one-click unfriend from a long list - instead you have to go to each stranger-friend in turn, select a drop-down menu, and scroll to the bottom of it to make your &quot;friendship&quot; go away.</p>
<p>Of course, friendship doesn&#39;t really go away. I have fond memories from years ago of many of these people, and if I were to meet them again in person I&#39;d like to catch up. But I really kind of resent Facebook mediating the relationship and re-reminding me about people who are out of my present orbit. I&#39;d rather get some absence rather than synthetic telepresence, and try to make the heart grow fonder by giving distant relationships some of the distance they are due.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s really quite simple to open up a Hubbard squash or any other big tough squashes.</p>
<p>Put the squash in a paper bag, lift it up high, and let it drop onto a hard concrete floor. I went down to the basement and dropped it from the ceiling. Once the squash has been cracked open, it generally can be cut into further smaller pieces without much ado.&#0160;</p>
<p>The various suggestions to hit the thing with an axe, a mallet, or other sharp or blunt instrument, or even to use a knife to start the process are quite inefficient compared to the wonderful force of gravity that can be at your command in this process.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, Saturday February 23, 2013, 7:00 p.m. - News monitored via Twitter is chaotic at the moment, with a variety of sources all confirming that there was a horrific crash on the last lap of the NASCAR race at Daytona, Florida today, injuring spectators. The various sources monitored do not agree on details of who and how many people were injured, and how serious the injuries are.</p>
<p>7:10 p.m. A news conference held by track officials states that 14 spectators were transported "off property" and 14 others were treated at the track. The site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nascar.com/presspass" target="_self">http://www.nascar.com/presspass</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>7:15 p.m. Jalopnik is <a href="http://jalopnik.com/insane-nascar-crash-at-daytona-ends-with-an-engine-near-398864966" target="_self">live blogging coverage of the crash</a>; they are up to update 18 at this point. They are following and posting updates from <a href="http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck" target="_self">Jeff Gluck</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>7:20 p.m. An <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/stewart-wins-daytona-after-scary-last-lap-crash" target="_self">AP story</a>&nbsp;repeats the 28 injuries number, and quotes&nbsp;Volusia County spokesman Dave Byron, reporting that "six people with serious injuries were taken by ambulance to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach."</p>
<p>7:25 p.m. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/volusiafire" target="_self">Volusia County Professional Firefighters Association</a> is reporting on Facebook, with comments mostly from people local to the area and links to news coverage.</p>
<p>7:30 p.m. <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?ctid=379" target="_self">Radio Reference for Volusia County</a> has several feeds including fire dispatch, and this alert message:</p>

<p>7:45 p.m. The Verge is reporting on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/23/4022512/nascar-copyright-takedown-daytona">NASCAR's efforts to take down fan video of the crash</a>. A short video of the crash scene was uploaded to Youtube immediately after the crash, and then taken down on a DMCA complaint. It is not known at this point whether that was an automated system generating the takedown notice or a deliberate decision by race day officials.</p>
<p>8:10 p.m.
The Verge has updated their reporting with this statement from NASCAR re the video takedown:
<blockquote>
The fan video of the wreck on the final lap of today's NASCAR Nationwide Series race was blocked on YouTube out of respect for those injured in today's accident. Information on the status of those fans was unclear and the decision was made to err on the side of caution with this very serious incident.
</blockquote>
Automated DMCA takedowns at Youtube are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/youtube-upgrades-its-automated-copyright-enforcement-system">tracked by the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.
</p>
<p>8:15 p.m. CBS Sports is now reporting that <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/story/21755101/six-people-seriously-injured-from-lastlap-accident">more than 30 spectators were injured</a>, based on reports directly from hospitals as to how many patients were admitted. They note that "the number of those transported given by (Speedway president Joie) Chitwood was slightly lower than that given by local officials."

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: This is not a low-fat dish. But it is delicious.</p>
<p>Coconut fried rice</p>
<ul>
<li>Leftover rice</li>
<li>Coconut oil</li>
<li>Dessicated (dried) coconut flakes or powder</li>
<li>Milk (I used almond milk to make this vegan)</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat oil in pan. Add leftover rice and dried coconut flakes. Mix and stir and cook. When the mixture is hot, add some milk. Sprinkle sugar on top to taste. Stir until hot; you&#39;ll know when it&#39;s done when the dried coconut doesn&#39;t taste dry. Serve hot.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t measure quantities, but I suspect that this recipe is tolerant of a lot of variety.</p>
<p>The biggest down side is that the pan ends up sticky. My usual treatment for this in a savory dish is to deglaze the pan with red wine, but that&#39;s obviously a non-starter here. I suspect that a small amount of white wine added to the pan at the end of cooking would be worthwhile.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Originally from Kate and Lynne, this recipe depends on red lentils (not green lentils) and generally can be made with ingredients already in stock in our house. Serve with pita and labneh (if you can manage to not eat all of the pita and labneh before dinner), and with a chopped green salad with a sumac vinagrette.</p>
<h3>Middle Eastern Red Lentil Soup</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 medium yellow onion chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed</li>
<li>1 T olive oil</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 C red lentils (NOT brown)</li>
<li>8 C water</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>fresh ground pepper</li>
<li>1 T ground cumin</li>
<li>lemon juice, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>In a big pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the onion is soft. Add the lentils, water, salt, pepper and cumin and bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer for at least 40 minutes (more is fine--if you are going to simmer for a LONG time then put a lid on the pot so all the water doesn&#39;t evaporate). Just before serving add half the lemon juice (at least one lemon&#39;s worth) and then taste to see if you want any more lemon juice, salt or pepper.<br /><br />**If you don&#39;t have any fresh lemons in the house, bottled lemon juice will suffice.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m trying my best to track every bill that affects Freedom of Information Act laws in Michigan.</p>
<p>The method runs as follows:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/" target="_self">Michigan Legislative Website</a>, where bills and their status are shown.</p>
<p>2. Search bill text for &quot;Freedom of information&quot;.</p>
<p>3. Note with (dismay? amazement?) that 14 bills are found, 4 on the Senate side, 10 on the House side. Realize that this includes legislation that refers to FOIA laws but does not change them.</p>
<p>4. Realize that there&#39;s no time at this particular instant to read through all the bills, but that needs to be done; save this post as a draft.</p>
<p>5. Realize that even a draft should be published, and publish it, hoping that I can come back later and zero in on a speedier approach.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In the early 1950s, Ann Arbor had only one public high school. A new high school was proposed and built on former University of Michigan land in the outskirts of Ann Arbor at the corner of Main Street and West Stadium Boulevard, diagonally across from the Michigan Stadium. (The land was formerly the Stadium Hills golf course.) Mahlon Buell, a physics teacher in the high school (1922-58), was an amateur photographer, and he filmed the the project from concept to completion. Buell joined long-time educator Gene D. Maybee, the principal at Tappan Junior High School (1936-70) and Ann Arbor Public School administrative employee, Gail Beaver, to narrate Buell&rsquo;s historic film. Ground was broken for the new Ann Arbor High School, now AA Pioneer HS, on Friday, June 26, 1953.</p>

      <div>
<p>Finn Brunton, U-M Assistant Professor of Information, will present &quot;<a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/node/1280591" target="_self">The Accidental Archive</a>.&quot; Brunton&#39;s talk, with the alternative title &quot;Researching criminals, otherkin, cipher anarchists, spammers and the online history that doesn&#39;t want to be kept,&quot; kicks off a new series of monthly events addressing emergent research. Light refreshments will be served.</p>
<p>Notes to follow. There&#39;s a hashtag, #MLibRes, on which a half dozen people are tracking. This is an impressionistic transcript, not a summary or tidy narrative, more notes drawn from what I remember from the time and some of my own thoughts mixed in.</p>
<p>&quot;Preservation is constant toil, entropy requires no maintenance.&quot;</p>
<p>Links are not permanent, and the scholar who depends on them persisting risks losing their research materials. Finn gave out bits of a manifesto, one of which was &quot;embrace wget&quot;.</p>
<p>The Law of the Good Neighbor, a theory of library collection shelving from Aby Warberg. <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/common_knowledge/v018/18.1.steinberg.html" target="_self">An essay of the same name by Michael Steinberg.</a></p>
<p>A discussion of Rodona Garst, a notorious spammer, and the ephemeral collections of data about her operations collected under the name <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040202002820/http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm" target="_self">Behind Enemy Lines. One such collection is on archive.org</a> so it has some hope of permanence. (but if you really want a copy, make one now)</p>
<p>Deep Blue is an institutional repository run by the University of Michigan. One notable project archived there is the Michigan Terminal System, which has original distribution tapes saved into non-ephemeral bits. Finn has been collecting tarballs of references for the works he&#39;s done, and one idea (new to him and recommended by the audience) was to put his tarballs in Deep Blue, with the right kind of dark-archive permanence that was suitable to the contents.</p>
<p>Reference to &quot;shearing layers&quot; from Stewart Brand&#39;s &quot;How buildings learn&quot;. Different parts of the system change at different speeds. <a href="http://quietbabylon.com/2011/shearing-layers-of-stuff-dematerialization-4/" target="_self">From Quiet Babylon, a discussion of shearing layers</a> looks interesting.</p>
<p>Heresies expounded: &quot;we should save everything&quot;, primarily because the Internet is all significant but to different populations. The example given is the Enron corpus, which is also a very useful spam corpus; if you discarded the spam you&#39;d have been left with something less useful. Saving everything is problematic to archivists who are used to assessing collections and picking the good parts and compiling a finding aid, rather than taking all of the unfiled materials and collecting them willy-nilly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more, but this captures the flavor of the event well; there will be a recording released.</p>
<p>Future events are Fourth Mondays. Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/UMLibRes" target="_self">UMLibRes</a> for details.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-21-contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager/">Contactually, an early review of this contact manager</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m on a 30 day trial of <a href="http://www.contactually.com"
target="_self">Contactually</a>, a contact manager that seems to
handle one important function only: reminding you to follow up
periodically with people who are important to you.</p>

<p>On the plus side, it does a good job of importing data from my
Google account and from a handful of social media sites, and by
doing so the amount of manual labor needed to do something with it
is kept to a minimum. New contacts are created by it watching your
inbox.</p>

<p>On the minus side, its sense of creating reminders depends on
creating buckets of similar contacts to be reminded on a similar
schedule, and the process of putting a living, breathing, complex
human being into exactly one bucket is difficult if not impossible
to do completely. They try to make a game of it, which at least
lets you speed through decisions, but it&rsquo;s still a difficult
task.</p>

<p>Once you have someone in a bucket it pulls a few of
them out of that bucket every so often and reminds you to follow
up with them. You can mark someone as followed up via email or
through some other method, so it will keep track of phone calls or
in-person meetings or whatever if you need to.</p>

<p>When I used to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_ACT!" target="_self">ACT</a>!, once upon a long time ago, I was better at following up with people because I kept track of when I last contacted people. I&#39;m always surprised that native contact managers don&#39;t have a field that they keep updated for &quot;last contacted&quot; that can easily be sorted and will automatically be populated from other things that the system knows. ACT! never made it into my Internet world successfully, but I still remember its ideas.&#0160;</p>

<p>Contactually is interesting, in the way that every single new contact manager is interesting. The price point is $0/mo (for a cut-down version), $20/mo (for what I have now), and $99/mo/user (for an enterprise version that I have no interest in). At $20/mo I had better be able to point to $1000/mo in new value coming from this, and based on the experience to date, I can&#39;t say yet that it&#39;s worthwhile to me at that price point. But I like the idea - hey, let your computer unearth some long-lost friends to remind you to chat with from time to time! I&#39;m just not sure that I couldn&#39;t get the same results by taking my contact list, putting it in a file, and then generating a <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools/blob/master/randomline" target="_self">random line in the file</a> to inspire me.</p>

<p>In this lecture on &quot;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Syndicate,&quot; speaker Jon Udell will review a case study — conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere — that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.</p>
<p>Udell is an author, information architect, software developer, and new media innovator. In 2007 Udell joined Microsoft Research as a writer, interviewer, speaker, and experimental software developer. Currently he is building and explaining a calendar network that&#39;s based on open standards and runs in the Windows Azure cloud.</p>
<p>His 1999 book,&#0160;<em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>, helped lay the foundation for what we now call social software. Udell was formerly a software developer at Lotus,&#0160;<em>BYTE</em>&#0160;magazine&#39;s executive editor and Web maven, and an independent consultant.</p>
<p>A hands-on thinker, Udell&#39;s analysis of industry trends has always been informed by his own ongoing experiments with software, information architecture, and new media.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2006 he was&#0160;<em>InfoWorld&#39;s</em>&#0160;lead analyst, author of the weekly Strategic Developer column, and blogger-in-chief. During his&#0160;<em>InfoWorld</em>&#0160;tenure he also pioneered the medium now known as screencasting and produced an audio show, Interviews with Innovators.</p>
<p>Udell provided the following abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;In&#0160;<em>Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read</em>&#0160;(1955), Rudolf Flesch ranted that &#39;horrible, stupid, emasculated, pointless, tasteless little readers&#39; were depriving kids of &#39;<em>Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>The Arabian Nights</em>&#0160;and Mark Twain, and anything interesting and worthwhile.&#39; He&#0160; argued: &#39;If you equip kids with the right conceptual tools they can read anything.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;As we colonize the cloud we can read — and write — in important new ways. But we&#39;re failing to equip most people with the right conceptual tools for these emerging modes of literacy. A web of connected information systems entails such concepts as authority over data, indirection, standard ways to structure and exchange data, controlled vocabularies, publish-and-subscribe networks, and use and recombination of services.</p>
<p>&quot;Students of the computer and information sciences learn and apply these principles. Others can too, but because they mostly don&#39;t they remain stuck at a &#39;Fun with Dick and Jane&#39; level of Web literacy.</p>
<p>&quot;In this talk we&#39;ll review a case study, conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere, that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.&quot;</p>
