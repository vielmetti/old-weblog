<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/" target="_self">Global Tuners</a> is a worldwide project for people to share their shortwave radio receivers. There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Global-tuners-perth-australia" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-500wi" alt="Global-tuners-perth-australia" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. That&rsquo;s been successful up to a point, but compared to the last time I was following this world (20 years ago) there&rsquo;s a lot less in the English language and more in Chinese. Getting access to tuners around the world, especially to ones that have better antenna setups than I do, is remarkably handy.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can use a shortwave set for most of the time is listening to AM and FM stations that are aimed at a local audience. Here is where some of the most unusual listening comes in - it&rsquo;s just plain fun to tune in an Australian FM station (via a tuner in Australia) and listen to what ordinary radio sounds like there.</p>
<p>For best results, you&rsquo;ll want to pair this with some lookup tools that help you figure out what&rsquo;s on the air at that time that&rsquo;s likely to be heard in that part of the world. <a href="http://short-wave.info" target="_self">Short-wave.info</a> has a nice real time database of broadcast schedules, so that if you are tuning around the dial on shortwave you can see which stations are likely to be broadcasting. &nbsp;<a href="http://fmscan.org/index.php" target="_self">FMSCAN</a> has global listings of AM and FM stations, and <a href="http://www.mwlist.org/ul_login.php?sprache=en" target="_self">MWLIST</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;longwave, mediumwave, tropical bands and a shortwave radio database. It&rsquo;s the kind of information that I recall from sorting through the back pages of the World Radio and TV Handbook, except that it&rsquo;s all linked together (and more up to date than my 1980s copy).</p>

      <p>When you notice <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak.html" target="_self">a big LinkedIn password breach</a> one day, and then several other sites also announce problems in subsequent days, there seems to be a pattern worth noticing. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed of late.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/" target="_self">Flame virus uses a previously undiscovered attack on the MD5 cryptographic hash</a> in order to carry out some of its devious work.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flame is the first known example of an MD5 collision attack being used maliciously in a real-world environment. It wielded the esoteric technique to digitally sign malicious code with a fraudulent certificate that&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-malware-was-signed-by-rogue-microsoft-certificate/">appeared to originate with Microsoft</a>. By deploying fake servers on networks that hosted machines already infected by Flame—and using the certificates to sign Flame modules—the malware was able to&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flames-god-mode-cheat-code-wielded-to-hijack-windows-7-server-2008/">hijack the Windows Update mechanism</a>&#0160;Microsoft uses to distribute patches to hundreds of millions of customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking over Windows Update is game over for a compromised system, and of course it&#39;s also an efficient way to keep your bugged system up to date with the latest bugs. Flame is thus suspected of being created by a powerful nation-state, since the crypto needed to do this is beyond the grasp of but a few skilled mathematicians.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bricklink.com" target="_self">Bricklink</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/messageThread.asp?ID=133899&amp;amp;nID=642624" target="_self">their admin user id was stolen</a>, and a number of accounts were fraudulently merged together. No word yet on how the attacker(s) got access to the key account on the system, and I haven&#39;t seen any other reporting about problems at this LEGO trading site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a few people noticed, a number of major accounts were merged fraudulently&#0160;around 12:15 pm EDT today. As a merge is almost impossible to undo, the solution&#0160;was to do a database rollback to 12:00 PM EDT today. This breach was due to the&#0160;Admin user ID being stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>TheNextWeb writes about <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/06/07/change-your-last-fm-password-now-there-may-have-been-another-security-breach/" target="_self">problems at last.fm which is reporting a big password leak</a> on the scale of LinkedIn. The <a href="http://www.last.fm/passwordsecurity" target="_self">last.fm notice</a> reads in part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently investigating the leak of some Last.fm user passwords. This follows recent password leaks on other sites, as well as information posted online. As a precautionary measure, we’re asking all our users to change their passwords immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Passwords are a weak link in many online systems, and password database security gets short shrift in some growing startups. Perhaps these two tweets from Pinboard&#39;s founder&#0160;Maciej Ceglowski are worth noting to round out the report.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>Proud to reassure my users that&#0160;<strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;passwords are not only hashed and salted, but pan-seared and dusted with a saffron quince reduction</div>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>(rightly) exasperated security person asks me to admit that Pinboard uses bcrypt. But there is no known way to make a bcrypt tweet funny</div>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-washing-machine-hose-leak-repair/">Washing machine has a hose leak? How to repair it.</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!</p>
<p>I used the <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Home-Repair/Appliance-Repair/how-to-repair-a-leaking-washing-machine/View-All" target="_self">Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine</a>&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. The repair was made with <a href="http://www.duckbrand.com/Products/diy-products/diy-specialties/self-fusing-repair-tape.aspx" target="_self">Duck Brand Wrap-Fix Tape</a>, a self-fusing silicone tape that says it&#39;s good to 100 PSI.&#0160;And <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Stadium_Hardware" target="_self">Stadium Hardware</a>&#0160;(Arborwiki link) is a marvelous store, with helpful folks and a seemingly infinite supply of parts for every hardware need.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s just hope the repair holds! The next step, if it doesn&#39;t, is to replace that hose entirely. Repair Clinic has <a href="http://www.repairclinic.com/GE-Washing-Machine-Hose-Tube-Or-Fittings-Parts?z=100" target="_self">about 70 different GE washing machine hose parts available</a>; I haven&#39;t yet identified the exact part.&#0160;</p>
<p>Please note that the repair for the high-pressure supply hose would be very different, as noted in the comment below. The Family Handyman guide referenced above suggests getting a metallic no-burst supply hose <a href="http://www.fluidmaster.com/washing-machine-connectors.html/" target="_self">similar to this one from Fluidmaster</a> to replace any worn, corroded, or leaky supply hoses. Supply lines run at much higher pressure than drain lines.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Change your LinkedIn password.</p>
<p>News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. LinkedIn, for its part, has promised to strengthen its internal controls and introduce a &quot;salt&quot; into its password storage system.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/" target="_self">An update from LinkedIn</a>&#0160;acknowledges the leak. The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/06/technology/linkedin-password-hack/index.htm" target="_self">reporting from CNN</a> is unusually detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Countless passwords on the list contain the word &quot;linkedin.&quot; On a&#0160;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">popular hacker forum</a>, many reported finding passwords such as &quot;linkedout,&quot; &quot;recruiter,&quot; &quot;googlerecruiter,&quot; &quot;toprecruiter,&quot; &quot;superrecruiter,&quot; &quot;humanresources&quot; and &quot;hiring.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leak was complicated by LinkedIn&#39;s use of SHA-1 as its encryption scheme for passwords without using a &quot;salt&quot; to improve password security. <a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/06/06/a-salt-free-diet-is-bad-for-your-security/" target="_self">AgileBits has a good discussion of how salting works</a>, and why you should use it; in short, it adds a little more randomness to even bad passwords so that an attacker can&#39;t pre-compute the hashed stored passwords directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Bot and Alice use the same password (and so have the same hash of their passwords) they don’t have to worry about each other. Who they need to worry about is Charlie the Cracker. Charlie may have spent months running software that picks passwords and generates the hashes of those passwords. He will store those millions of passwords and their hashes in a database called a “Rainbow Table.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without a rainbow table, modern password cracking hardware is mighty fast. How fast? <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2012/06/confirmed-linkedin-6mil-password-dump.html" target="_self">Robert Graham from Errata Security lays it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;How fast can hackers crack passwords? The answer &quot;2 billion per second&quot; using the Radeon HD 7970 (the latest top-of-the-line graphics processor). Each letter of a password has 100 combinations (UPPER, lower, d1g1ts, $ymbols). A 5 letter password therefore has&#0160;<tt>100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100</tt>&#0160;or 10 billion combinations, meaning it can be cracked in 5 seconds. A 6 letter password has 100 times that, or 500 seconds. A 7 letter password has 100 times that, or 50,000 seconds, or 13 hours. An 8 character password is roughly 57 days. A 9 character password is 100 times that, about 15 years. In other words, if your password was 7 letters, the hacker has already cracked it, but if it&#39;s 9 letters, it&#39;s too difficult to crack with brute force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, &quot;too difficult&quot; for one computer is not the same as &quot;too difficult&quot; for a network of computing resources. Thomas Roth in 2010 on <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/15/cracking-in-the-cloud-amazons-new-ec2-gpu-instances/" target="_self">Cracking Passwords in the Cloud</a>&#0160;on Amazon&#39;s EC2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the CUDA-Multiforce, I was able to crack all hashes from&#0160;<a href="http://stacksmashing.net/blogfiles/2010_11_15/sha1_hashes.txt">this</a>&#0160;file with a password length from 1-6 in only 49 Minutes (1 hour costs 2.10$ by the way.):</p>
<div>
<div>Compute done: Reference time 2950.1 seconds<br />Stepping rate: 249.2M MD4/s<br />Search rate: 3488.4M NTLM/s</div>
</div>
<p>This just shows one more time that SHA1 for password hashing is deprecated – You really don’t want to use it anymore! Instead, use something like scrypt or PBKDF2! Just imagine a whole cluster of these machines (which is now easily available to anybody thanks to Amazon) cracking passwords for you. Pretty comfortable, large-scale password cracking for everybody!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 6 character SHA-1 hashes would cost about $2 to crack in 2010 computer-dollars; 7 characters, $200; 8 characters, $20,000; and 9 characters, &quot;only&quot; $2 million. <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/20/cracking-passwords-in-the-cloud-getting-the-facts-straight/" target="_self">Roth further concludes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that was new is that, due to the new Amazon offering, everyone is able to spawn a 100-or-more node cluster in the cloud and distribute the task of cracking passwords onto these nodes. The task of cracking hashes is especially suitable for massive parallelization! An attacker could easily spawn a gigantic cluster of nodes using stolen credit card information, and it would be no problem for him to crack 8-character passwords in a nice timeframe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, &quot;recruiter&quot;, step up your game (and change your password, and your password algorithm).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do.</p>
<p>Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The maddening part of the network that doesn&#39;t work is that instead of working with the network you end up working to repair the network, and its unreliablity neither gives you access nor downtime.  In other words, spotty wifi is bad, worse than no wifi at all.</p>
<p>(Posted on the occasion of the repair of my MacBook&#39;s wifi card, which had been flaky for months.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My Mac is in the shop. It&#39;s getting a new wifi card, and while they are at it they&#39;ll replace the chipped case. The chip fixing means that labor is free for the wifi fixing so it&#39;s a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The last time I had any kind of extended computer downtime I remember it being a strain, since I then had so much of my personal computing stuff actually on my computer. Now more than ever that&#39;s not the case, and I get along just fine with occasional logins from library computer systems or even the ultra-basic stripped down version of apps that I get on my not-very-smart Blackberry.</p>
<p>At some point, everything that you care enough about is also in the cloud somewhere. That might be for backups, so that if you lose a system you can carry on with minimum restore time. It might be to increase the power of whatever web-enabled terminal you log into, so that whatever public system you connect to has most of your stuff even if that stuff is private. Mostly though things go into the cloud and stay there because all physical media are fragile. The consequences of relying on anything in your own possession - especially something that gets knocked around a bit - are too great, and it&#39;s better to have those things also or primarily somewhere else that feels safe.</p>

<p>SEMOLINA PUDDING<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 cup milk<br />4 cups water<br />grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)<br />1 cup semolina flour<br />cinnamon<br />raspberries or other berries<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. Remove from heat and pour into bowl, mold, or cupcake pan. Refrigerate for at least two hours. Pudding should be somewhat firmer than chocolate pudding, but less firm than jello.<br /><br />When ready to serve, unmold pudding or leave in bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon. Top with raspberries or other fruit. Sugared raspberries are particularly nice when a little bit of sauce is formed and can be poured over the pudding.<br /><br />The pudding has a texture that is somehow both agreeably grainy and smooth and is very cooling in the summertime. You can vary the milk:water ratio in the recipe, even to the point of omitting one or the other entirely.<br /><br />(thanks to puddingmeister Deb for the recipe)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. It makes me want to start something brand new of my own - but then - you end up being captured by all of the tools you have to learn to bring it online.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing to think through this is that all new shiny online services have a lifespan. Some of them grow quickly and then die (remember Pownce? I thought not), some of them grow slowly and still live on somehow (remember Plurk?), others never get off the ground (a dozen tiny spam-overrun Twitter clones), and a tiny handful make it to Twitter size. You generally don&#39;t know when you&#39;re starting to talk to people through some new online system whether you are going to treat it as a long-term commitment to learning a complex system, or just some hands-on experimentation in something to be ignored and forgotten in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So you are a hamster, and you see a wheel. Do you get on to try it out, give yourself some exercise, or do you go to your workshop and build a better wheel?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge.</p>
<p>Github is mostly about software, but there are lots of other things that lend themselves to incremental parallel development - development that doesn&#39;t have to follow the wiki model of last one in gets to edit. If you think of github (the hosting service) combined with some shared recipe archive (a la grouprecipes, the Usenet Cookbook, or whatever your favorite recipe starting place is) you&#39;re thinking about what I&#39;m thinking.</p>
<p>Lots of people cook the way you&#39;d expect, starting off from a given recipe and then branching out to accomodate the seasons, ingredients on hand, their own tastes and the tastes (picky) of their family. If I&#39;m doing a cookbook, I want to acknowledge that someone else&#39;s mac and cheese recipe was the starter of my own but I don&#39;t want to actually edit their cookbook in writing mine.</p>
<p>Besides, &quot;fork&quot; is such an obvious name for a cookbook tool.</p>

      <p>Some sources for information on the Duck Lake Fire, which started on Wednesday, May 23, 2012 and is burning rapidly in <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_County%2C_Michigan" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Luce County, Michigan">Luce County</a>, north of Newberry, MI. The fire is dangerous and has caused evacuations; if you are reading this and you are in the area, seek authoritative and current information from official sources.</p>
<p>The fire brings to mind the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/08/fire-maps-for-t.html" target="_self">2007 Sleeper Lake Fire</a>&#0160;which burned over 18,000 acres in Luce County.&#0160;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Duck Lake Fire team really needs to hear from people who have property located within the fire area (especially those property owners that may be out of state). U.P. residents call 211; all others call 800-338-1119. Please give your name, fire number and road, and contact info so we can provide updates as damage assessments are completed. (Folks who&#39;ve already called and provided fire number and road name do NOT need to call again.)&#0160;<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/AtGoogleTalks" rel="youtube" target="_blank" title="Andrew Keen">Andrew Keen</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Vertigo-Revolution-Diminishing-Disorienting/dp/0312624980" target="_self">Digital Vertigo</a> is a follow-on to his earlier <a title="The Cult of the Amateur: How Today&#39;s Internet is Killing Our Culture">The Cult of the Amateur</a>. Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">Facebook</a> and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful.</p></p>

<p>With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo. With a hefty 40 plus pages of end notes and indexing, there was hardly a page of the work that didn&#39;t echo someone else&#39;s thoughts.</p>

<p>With everything so carefully indexed and footnoted, I thought I&#39;d skip to the chase and see if the earliest arguments against technology in thought and human relations were also there. In The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phaedrus-Plato/dp/0872202208%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dsuperpatron-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0872202208" rel="amazon" target="_blank" title="Phaedrus">Phaedrus</a>, Plato relates argument the argument of Socrates that writing is a technology which leads to a diminishing of intelligence and of understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soc. I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately
like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude
of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn
silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine
that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and
put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying
answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled
about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and
know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are
maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they
cannot protect or defend themselves. (<a
href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm"
target="_self">Plato, The Phaedrus</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keen doesn&#39;t quote from Plato, but he does credit himself a &quot;celebrated public speaker&quot;. It&#39;s important that someone have a reasonable criticism of today&#39;s social networks, just so we can understand them better <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">when they inevitably change or fail</a>. This particular text probably reads better as an ebook, with all of its carefully collected citations linked; it might, like the example of Phaedrus, be even better in person delivered by the speaker who can vary his answer to incorporate the changes of the day and defend his thoughts.</p>

<p>A good book for an airplane ride, or a good ebook for a contrarian romp through modern social networks hype or to congratulate yourself for missing the Facebook IPO.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m in the midst of a job hunt, and so I expect that people I talk to who don&#39;t know me very well will take a look at this weblog as part of the things they look for when trying to assess who I am or to help prepare them to make small talk as a part of discussion. This is a good and useful reason to write in a weblog, to make yourself easy to strike up a conversation with.</p>
<p>As blogs go, Vacuum is relatively old school in that it deals with everything and nothing - you&#39;ll find dozens of categories, ranging from strawberry picking to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/power-outage-mapping.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="Power Outage Mapping">power outages</a> to seasonal holidays to technical discussions in a variety of fields. If it looks like a somewhat eclectic notebook, that&#39;s because it is. At various times when the need has arisen I&#39;ve pulled out separate weblogs to corral related information together. Superpatron, for innovation in library systems, was the one that really took off to have a life of its own for a while. When I wrote for AnnArbor.com, a weekly column on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/foia-jobs-looking-for-all-of-your-ideas-on-foiachat.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="FOIA jobs: looking for all of your ideas on #FOIAchat">FOIA</a> had enough cohesion to look like a body of work and not just a collection of ephemeral interests.</p>
<p>When you create a resume crafted for a particular job, you emphasize the particular skills and abilities you have and by keeping it brief you remove a whole set of other things. When you blog voraciously over a decade, you collect a whole lot of things that look temporarily interesting but sometimes - perhaps more than sometimes - just turn out to be interesting of the moment.</p>
<p>So, hi. You&#39;re reading this. There&#39;s a lot here, if you search. If you ask about anything, there&#39;s probably more to be said. I assume that you&#39;ll understand if there&#39;s some things here that look unfinished, because that&#39;s by design.&#0160;</p>
