<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Sandy hit the US East Coast earlier this week, knocking out power to more than 8 million subscribers. The damage to the infrastructure was so severe that it&#39;s expected to take more than a week to bring service back.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.</p>
<p><strong>NY Times</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/30/nyregion/new-york-power-outages.html" target="_self">tracking power outages and restoration for the Con Edison service</a>. They&#39;re pulling county by county data from the utility company web site and tracking and visualizing it over time. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/31/nyregion/where-the-power-is-out-and-returning.html" target="_self">More detailed reporting also covers surrounding states</a>, including hard-hit New Jersey and Long Island. Sample graphic:</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 57" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 57" /></a><br /><strong>Con Edison Charts</strong></p>
<p>Another tracker for Con Edison outage information has been done by Cameron Cundiff (@<a href="http://twitter.com/ckundo" target="_self">ckundo</a>) from Pivotal Labs. This one features <a href="https://github.com/ckundo/coned_charts" target="_self">source code on Github</a>&#0160;and a chart on <a href="http://stormpox.com/" target="_self">stormpox.com</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 59" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 59" /></a><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>iFactor’s Storm Center</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Storm Center&quot; application from iFactor powers the web sites for a number of the larger utilities affected by Hurricane Sandy. In&#0160;<a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com/storm-center-put-to-the-test-during-sandy/">Storm Center put to the test during Sandy</a>, they discuss how the systems held up in the storm. Some&#0160;3,500,000 visits were logged to the mapping pages, and of those 20-50% were from mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>NYC Power Status</strong></p>
<p>Does NYC have power? A simple page shows current restoration status by borough. &quot;Con Edison is working on it.&quot; See <a href="http://www.nycpowerstatus.com" target="_self">nycpowerstatus.com</a>.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c33071a54970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 61" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c33071a54970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c33071a54970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 61" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Google Crisis Map</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2012-sandy" target="_self">Google Crisis Map for Superstorm Sandy</a> has an overlay showing utility company outage sites, shown here in orange.</p>

<p><strong>The trouble with utility outage tracking</strong></p>
<p>The hardest part about tracking utility outages across a broad area is that there&#39;s wide variety in how each utility reports outages. It would be useful to a lot of organizations to have a single map covering the whole storm area, but instead we have little pieces of a big picture.</p>

      <p>My twitter feed is blowing up with people discussing Hurricane Sandy and its likely impact on the East Coast. In the interests of having somewhere useful to drop things that come up along the way, here&#39;s a live blog of sorts of the event. I&#39;ll put all of my Sandy stuff here, rather than have it go over multiple other entries. The top of this is collected info; the bottom is the blog collecting things without much sorting except chronological.

<p>My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage map collection</a> is a good point of reference. It&#39;s organized by state, with phone numbers and twitter feeds for utility company news and information. It loads relatively slowly because of all of the graphics, so you&#39;ll want to bookmark your utility&#39;s pages and save their phone number before the storm hits.</p>
<p>On Twitter, I&#39;m following a list @<a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/poweroutage" target="_self">vielmetti/poweroutage</a> with about 40 utility company feeds all in one place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m at Lou Rosenfeld&#39;s talk at the Michigan Union, with the title &quot;Beyond user research: Building an organizational brain&quot;. Notes below.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;You are not your user.&quot; The importance of talking to your users. The book &quot;Design of Everyday Things&quot;, 1986 as a watershed event. Everyone understands this now, so &quot;we won&quot;. But what does victory look like?</p>
<p>&#0160;Less of an information architect, more of an information therapist.</p>
<p>Reports from the user research group; information about site search analytics (in another group); logs from the call center (yet another group); reports from web analytics applications (yet another group); also &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; (survey research); CRM applications like Salesforce; papers from a research center; papers from the net; a &quot;mental model&quot; diagram; brand architecture research; net promoter score (survey research).</p>
<p>The problem: where&#39;s the insight in a situation that&#39;s completely siloed. Risk to &quot;user research&quot; work is that it&#39;s siloed away. If you collaborate you&#39;re &quot;the brain for the organization&quot;.</p>
<p>1. What vs. why.&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Quantitative vs qualitiative.</p>
<p>3. Organizational goals vs user goals.</p>
<p>4. Measure what you know vs. explore what you don&#39;t know. (Look for outliers, surprises, patterns.)</p>
<p>5. Statistical data vs. descriptive data.</p>
<p>How to succeed in getting user research to cooperate? Use data from other siloes. Examples: site search data from search logs; match persona with search log analysis; use analytics tools to frame questions about user behavior; field study + analytics combined.&#0160;</p>
<p>Example: query search for &quot;lost&quot; on Netflix.</p>
<p>How to get out of your silo: get out of your (physical) space; eat in the other cafeteria.</p>
<p>Boundary object: things that are common to a couple of fields. Linkages are connective areas of shared interest.</p>
<p>(The preso will be up in slideshare....these notes are incomplete of course)</p>
<p>Build a map - put the various interests on the map to generate the space that you can evaluate the various options.&#0160;</p>
<p>Stop using words - &quot;useless, misunderstood terms impede progress&quot;. Meaningless buzzwords, none of which involve solving problems.</p>
<p>Build a dashboard (a failed metaphor) which incorporates information across a number of separate siloes.&#0160;</p>

      <p><p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/24/weather-journal-storm-could-make-next-week-a-mess/" target="_self">Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name</a>.</p>

Most of the storm traffic is on #<a href="http://twitter.com/#sandy" target="_self">sandy</a>. </p>
<p>The other name for the storm is &quot;Frankenstorm&quot;, from the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd&amp;version=0&amp;fmt=reg" target="_self">Hydrometeorological Prediction Center</a>&#0160;extended forecast for Thursday, October 25, 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] These models are predicting that Sandy will get caught up by the trough approaching the Eastern U.S., which will inject a large amount of energy into the storm, converting it to a powerful subtropical storm with a central pressure below 960 mb and sustained winds of 60 - 70 mph. Winds of this strength would likely cause massive power outages, as trees still in leaf take out power lines. Also of great concern are Sandy&#39;s rains. Given that ocean temperatures along the Northeast U.S. coast are about&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at">5°F above average</a>, there will be an unusually large amount of water vapor available to make heavy rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy is now a category 1 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and central pressure of 970 hPa (see picture).&#0160; My community is all aflutter about this storm, particularly since our forecast models are&#0160;<strong>not&#0160;</strong>in agreement&ndash;some suggest the storm will intensify and head straight in to the Middle Atlantic coastline, some take it out to sea, and others move it out to sea before swinging it westward to hit New England or the Canadian maritimes.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?</p>
<p>I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;<a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-October/date.html" target="_self">outages</a>&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. One report of call failures listed the following cities:</p>
<pre>Cedar Rapids
Springfield, IL
Madison, WI
Green Bay, WI
Minneapolis
Sioux Falls
Omaha
Des Moines
Dubuque
Fargo
St. Louis
Davenport
Kansas City
Detroit

      </h3>
      <p>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.</p>
<p>2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</p>
<p>3. Cast 4 votes, leaving none behind, and choosing one of the candidates you are opposed to to round out the ballot.</p>
<p>The strategy is called &quot;bullet voting&quot;, and it has some pros and cons which are neatly spelled out in this <a href="http://larrydavidson.blogspot.com/2005/09/bullet-voting-pro-and-con.html" target="_self">2005 blog post from Larry Davidson</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, to bullet-vote or not? The choice depends entirely on which scenario you think is more probable. If the race for fourth place is between your two favorite candidates, you should bullet-vote. If the race for fourth place is between your second choice and someone you strongly dislike, you should not bullet-vote. Maybe it’s not how they would handle it on&#0160;<em>Numb3rs,&#0160;</em>but math can’t give you a definite answer here.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullet voting is also known as &quot;plunking&quot;. The general case of voting systems being gamed by strategic voters is more common than you&#39;d expect, since it can give a coordinated minority the ability to decide an election over a disorganized majority.</p>

The one copy we have is falling apart because it&#39;s been so heavily used. We had to photocopy it.&quot;</p>
<p>Creason was also enthralled by the discovery of several &quot;Mapfox&quot; Los Angeles street guides published in 1944. Creason said in his 32-year library career he had never seen one.</p>

      <p>I had my first chance to sit at the new Elixir Vitae cafe on East Liberty today. The store is one of two with that name, after the Cafe Ambrosia store on Maynard Street changed its name. (Same ownership, just a new name, because of conflicts with too many other coffee businesses called Ambrosia).</p>
<p>Some impressions:</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more sunshine in the new cafe than there ever was in the old one. Maynard is shaded by the parking structure and by Tower Plaza, but East Liberty has a nice south-facing window and light coming in.</p>
<p>The general ambiance is about the same, but not as many people have discovered the new cafe just yet. I&#39;m expecting it to eventually get something between a Main Street and a State Street sense to it, but for now, I was mostly alone in using the place for an extended typing session.</p>
<p>The local events bulletin board has a good selection to look at - it&#39;s not quite as big as the Maynard location, which has in my opinion one of the finest bulletin boards in town.</p>
<p>All in all a solid showing and a good new place to go.</p>

<p>While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=typd" target="_self">a2council</a>&#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience. The running cmmentary made it easier to follow what was going on, and it served as a back channel to help make sense of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The council was working from an agenda that&#39;s in the <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com" target="_self">Legistar system</a>, and from time to time I&#39;d go back to that to see what the text of an agenda item was, to look at supporting materials, and see the detail.</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Chronicle does near-real-time news coverage as a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/category/civic-news-ticker/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker</a>, reporting out results from key votes and decisions during the meeting. This is brief coverage but important, and it sets the stage for their 10,000 word meeting reports that come out a week or so later.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a window open to <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a>, which has a local encyclopedia of information about what is going on in the city and the surrounding area. As council considered various options, I looked up what Arborwiki had to say about the current state of affairs, and updated it as best I could to reflect the meeting results and the news that was happening.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that watching this multi-connected stream was different from the experience of being in the same room as council. You miss the non-verbal communications, the body language, the hallway conversations that take place during breaks, and all sorts of in-person nuance. But for what it was, I&#39;m pretty happy with the experience. It felt like I was engaged with the meeting and could have a sense that I was part of the civic process.</p>

      <p>What we got:</p>
<p>Tomatoes - &quot;last tomatoes of the year&quot;, the vendor said.</p>
<p>Yellow beans - &quot;one more week of these&quot;</p>
<p>1/2 peck Rome apples. &quot;We lost 80% of the crop, only have 5 varieties instead of 20&quot;</p>
<p>Flat leaf parsley</p>
<p>Radishes</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes</p>
<p>Sweet red peppers</p>
<p>The market was busy and there was a full set of vendors under the covered awnings, but no one in the sand lot.</p>
<p>Afterwards I ran into Kim Bayer who is working with <a href="http://arborwiki.org/The_Brinery" target="_self">The Brinery</a> to support their goal of upping their capacity to make sauerkraut.

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> is a local encyclopedia about the Ann Arbor area that anyone can edit. Up til now, it&#39;s been running on the same Mediawiki software that powers Wikipedia, but we&#39;re in the process of moving it to a new Localwiki instance.</p>
<p><a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a> is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California. The Localwiki software is especially good at handling maps, and so it should be that much easier to map out the streets and roads of Ann Arbor and surrounding Washtenaw County.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now also a new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/" target="_self">Facebook group</a> to discuss Arborwiki, which has been handy for sorting through restart visuals. I&#39;ll make sure to invite everyone who has touched the project so far to it.</p>
<p>In response to some questions:</p>
<p>The migration process has been relatively smooth so far, with about 10,000 pages moved in without much in the way of hand-editing things to patch them up. There&#39;s an importer for Mediawiki pages into Localwiki that handles a lot of the heavy lifting. We had to redesign the home page to take advantage of the new include file syntax, and there are some Mediawiki templates that I used for automatically generating links to news clippings that I&#39;ll have to reimagine. Localwiki founder Philip Neustrom has been a big help, and we&#39;re running on a Ubuntu instance that Ryan Eby at the Ann Arbor District Library spun up for us.</p>
<p>Not a lot of the Arborwiki pages had maps on them, so Philip wrote a little bit of custom code to make that happen more frequently by automatically recognizing some pages with addresses on them.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>
<p>In Lincoln, Nebraska, the library system is looking at spending $43 million on a new main downtown library. &quot;The study envisions a “21st century main library” with a café, 250-seat auditorium with green rooms, a black box theater, kitchen, Internet stations and larger adult, children and teen areas.

<p><strong>Teachers</strong></p>
<p>Chicago teachers start their seventh day of a teachers strike Tuesday, as the city goes to court to try to end the strike on the grounds that it is illegal.

<p><strong>Sidewalks</strong></p>
<p>In 1888, an Ann Arbor City Council meeting was dominated by petitions from citizens for the city to put in sidewalks. In one case, a resident asked that a neighbor&#39;s dilapidated barn be torn down to make way for a sidewalk. [<a href="http://oldnews.aadl.org/node/93778" target="_self">Ann Arbor Argus</a> / Old News]</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Ann Arbor City Council meeting had an extended discussion of filling in the gaps in the city&#39;s sidewalk network. Council members noted several locations in their wards where students did not have a safe way to walk to school on sidewalks or a safe place to cross busy streets; others on council noted that the existing non-motorized transportation plan already addressed this and other issues. When it came to a vote, the proposal to study sidewalk gaps was turned down 6-5.

      </h3>
      <p>As I listen to a plane go overhead today, I remember how quiet it was here in Ann Arbor after 9/11 when the entire US airspace was shut down. You could hear the birds a lot more easily, and the sky was clear.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/the-day-after-what-9122001-was-like.html" target="_self">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/june04/geophen.html" target="_self">Geotimes, 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The empty skies also allowed David Travis of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and his co-workers to determine how contrails might be changing local temperature. Their results, first published in&#0160;<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/418601a.html" target="_self"><em>Nature</em>&#0160;in August 2002</a> and further elucidated last March in the&#0160;<em>Journal of Climate</em>, showed that during the days when jets were grounded in September 2001, sunshine increased the temperature at ground level instead of being reflected by contrails. At night, the researchers found, the absence of an insulating layer of contrails meant greater ground level cooling.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s hard to think that this happened more than a decade ago.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve always written better when there has been a deadline. Here&#39;s what I have on top of my mind on a chilly September morning, written over the span of about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago teachers are on strike</strong>. The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-strike-updates-pickets-up-as-more-talks-scheduled-20120910,0,4173856.story" target="_self">Chicago Tribune&#39;s live blog of the strike</a>&#0160;notes that 144 locations are open to handle kids that get free lunches and breakfasts, and that the CTA is offering free fares to students to get to those schools. Teachers are on the picket lines, chanting&#0160;&quot;What do we want? Fair contract. When do we want it? Now!&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Cuba had a power outage</strong> yesterday. An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/cuba-power-failure_n_1869373.html?utm_hp_ref=world" target="_self">AP story (via Huffington Post)</a>&#0160;says that &quot;millions&quot; were affected, for up to five hours. No explanation was given for the outage, and the <a href="http://radiohc.cu/ing/" target="_self">English language page of Radio Havana</a>&#0160;had no mention of the incident.</p>
<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong>: A crew from Beal is <strong>demolishing a house</strong> at Kingsley and First.

<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong>: <strong>Road construction</strong> continues all over town. The corner of Packard and Stadium is down to one lane in each direction, causing delays.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong>: Gas prices in the area range from $3.82 (Costco) to $4.25 (BP, Exit 169) according to <a href="http://www.annarborgasprices.com/" target="_self">AnnArborGasPrices.com</a>, a service of GasBuddy.</p>
<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong>: See the Arborwiki <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Unbuilt_Developments" target="_self">Unbuilt Developments</a> page for a look at proposed development and construction in Ann Arbor that never made it past the planning stage.</p>
<p><strong>University of Michigan</strong>: The Wolverines beat Air Force at Michigan Stadium, despite an overwhelming show of air power by Air Force in the pregame. [<a href="http://mgoblog.com/mgoboard/b2-flyover-michigan-airforce" target="_self">video of B-2 bomber</a>] (via MGoBlog). Parking prices were $50 at Pioneer High School as rain the night before forced parts of the golf courses to be closed. We parked 3 cars at $15. Next week: Massachusetts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>906 day (September 6) celebrates the area code of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. First I&#39;ve heard of this holiday, but I heartily approve.</p>
<p>In honor of this day a couple of nice photos of Marquette, MI came via Shorpy. The photos of the <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12492" target="_self">harbor and ore docks</a>, <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12489" target="_self">Front Street</a>, and a <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12493" target="_self">panorama of downtown Marquette</a>&#0160;date from 1908 and 1909 and are from glass negatives from the Detroit Publishing Company.</p>
<p>A detail below shows the Hotel Janzen, with a train&#39;s smoke just to the left of it and a piece of City Hall at the far left.</p>

<p>Update: I checked with USGS to make sure that the gauges were working fine, and got back this result:</p>
<blockquote>We&#39;re pretty certain everything is working just fine there. I believe we have a hydrologic technician there today making a streamflow measurement and he&#39;ll verify the operation of the equipment at the same time. Tom&#0160;</blockquote></p>
