<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>Kai Petainen writes that the downtown "Library Lot" parking structure so full on New Years Eve that when everyone went to leave it at once, the lines were so long that people's paid tickets ran out of time. This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay.</p>

<p>I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events. I look forward to a postmortem on this at the next <a href="http://www.a2dda.org">Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority</a> board meeting, January 8, 2014 at noon.</p>

<p>As always with a disaster like this, if you are in the affected area, you want to get information from a media source that is likely to be more up to date than this weblog.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_in_Fargo%E2%80%93Moorhead">news sources from nearby</a>, then any links that make sense to tell the story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emergency and fire-fighting crews are respond-ing to the derailment, which Amy McBeth, a spokeswoman for BNSF, said occurred at around 2:10 p.m. McBeth said no crew members on the train were injured during the acci-dent. The train was 106 cars long and headed east-bound, she said.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy
of something I've already written and published somewhere else.
That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by
googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into
the ether too quickly (including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ourfounder/posts/10152097845036826">this thread</a> which will die quietly
when we are all done with it).</p>

<p>Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really
provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic
discussion. Rather, they bias towards the moderator's interests,
because only the posts from the moderator are visible for long
enough to get any traffic.</p>

<p>The problem of how to build forum software is old and solved. The
MTS Confer system and others that followed it like Picospan and <a href="http://www.caucus.com">Caucus</a>
lived in a world where you could create a long-running discussion
that focused on one topic and where you could keep that topic mostly
on-topic over an extended period of time. Facebook, in contrast, 
feels more like a big chat room, where yesterday's posts scroll off
into nothingness and where you can't get back to any discussion you
once had - no matter how good it was.</p>

<p>Twitter doesn't give you the paragraph-sized chunks of discussion that
you need to actually have an intelligent conversation, but it does 
have long-lived hashtags that enable a community of interest to form
and (with scheduled chats) thrive. It's possible to find people who
you don't know who share an interest and to communicate with them in
such a way that a simple enough search brings back something useful.
Nothing on Facebook behaves that way.</p>

and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting
outages as well as citizens would have them do. </p>

<p>The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL,
the <a href="http://www.lbwl.com/">Lansing Board of Water and Light</a>. Even though the surrounding
area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly
encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing,
LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively 
unusual in this day and age.</p>

<p>The map below is a crowd-sourced tracking of outages and
restorations in the Lansing area. It's been put together
under the lead of @<a href="http://twitter.com/jsiarto">jsiarto</a> (Jeff Siarto) with the help of
other Lansing area residents and with data pulled in part from
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LansingBWL">LBWL Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lbwl.com/">Lansing Board of Water and Light</a> is a municipally owned public utility,
governed by a Board of Commissioners. The board is made up of eight
Lansing residents, each appointed for a four-year term on the board
by the Mayor and confirmed by City Council.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike Consumers Energy and DTE, Lansing Board of Water and Light doesn't have a real time outage map for customers, but it's something the company is currently developing, according to company spokesperson Steve Serkaian.</p>
  
  <p>"We're working on a "smart grid" system that's similar to what other utilities offer, but it's something that costs a significant amount of money to implement," he said. "But we have heard our customers loud and clear and we're committed to working on communicating with them better."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(BWL General Manager J. Peter Lark) said BWL is running at “optimum” staffing levels. On Friday, he said, 30 crews were on the ground, a figure that includes 12 line crews and five tree-trimming crews. Crews are made up of two or three people, with most line crews using three.
  The utility to date has brought in outside help from five other municipally owned utilities, but Lark said Friday he doesn’t plan to bring in more — at least one BWL employee would have to ride with the outside crew, and that would reduce the number of BWL crews in operation.</p>

  <p>Most of those still without power are customers of Lansing’s public utility. Angry customers showed up at a company press conference yesterday to complain about the slow repairs. The number of Lansing Board of Water and Light customers without power actually increased yesterday as melting ice from tree limbs damaged more power lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The press conference confirmed communication failures on the part of the officials involved. But when will that get better? Why not now? When will the outages be over? When will the community return to normal? When will the powers-that-be get their act together so people can make wise choices? Temperatures are expected to plunge into single digits tonight. What should people whose power is out do now? Move their families, especially the elderly and infirm, to other locations? Can people with pets still take them to the Ingham County Animal Shelter? When will those who should have the answers start communicating effectively?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This delicious lentil, feta, and olive pasta salad is adapted from the cookbook <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/best-125-meatless-pasta-dishes/oclc/24375167">The Best 125 Meatless Pasta Dishes</a> by <a href="http://mindycooks.blogspot.com/">Mindy Toomay</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/author/geiskopfhadlersusann">Susann Geiskopf-Hadler</a>, published by <a href="http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/article/setting-the-pace-prima-publishing-12266/1">Prima Publishing</a> in 1992.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of water to 1.5 cups of lentils in a saucepan on the stove. Add 2 bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then cook 25-35 minutes until the lentils are done. Rinse under cold water and drain. Note: you'll want lentils that hold their shape in cooking; look for French lentils or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/855532">lentils du Puy</a> in the bulk section of your favorite grocer.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, chop vegetables. Note that all vegetables are to be chopped small, so that they are not that much bigger than the lentils. For the vegetables:</p>

<ul>
<li>one bell pepper, green or red</li>
<li>1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted of course</li>
</ul>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, wash a bunch of parsley, and run it through the food processor until it is chopped very fine.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, make a salad dressing, which is a nice garlicky vinaigrette.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
<li>2 medium cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced fine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Near the end of the lentil cooking time, put on pasta to cook. </p>

<p>Just before serving, dice or crumble some feta and put it into a separate bowl, in the case that you have dinner guests who don't care for feta.</p>

<p>Get a large bowl, and mix the lentils, vegetables, parsley, and dressing together in it.</p>

<p>Very delicious. Serve at room temperature.</p>

<p>Prep time - 45 to 60 minutes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.</p>

<p>In the winter months it's harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it's warm. That all said, there's no less need to be mindful of how much exercise you are getting when it's cold out.</p>

<p>In days past, I was able to predict my mood rather accurately by checking how many steps I got on my pedometer. If the number was below 5000 you could count on me to be grouchy, and those rare days when the count exceeded 20000 were days when I couldn't concentrate on much of anything except moving. There's a seasonally adjusted optimum of approximately 10000 steps - minus a few in winter, plus a few in summer - that I think of as a target that if I happen to move that much in a day that everything else works out OK.</p>

<p>I've used <a href="http://www.walkertracker.com">Walker Tracker</a> on and off since 2006, or so the stats tell me, and in that time I've logged over 7 million steps. Though the site interface has changed a little bit and my old crowd of fellow pedestrians has mostly moved on from the site, there are still a few familiar faces of people more industrious than I am in logging their activity. I'm looking forward to revisiting it and being a bit more diligent about getting out and about in the winter time.</p>

<p>Note to self: buy new mittens, ideally ones that let me have at least one index finger free to work my phone.</p>

<p>Note to self 2: the battery is said to last 6 months, whether you use the system or not, so be prepared to change it on the summer solstice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite".</p>

<p>The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. Because the Twitter writing environment is so spare, it's relatively easy to produce something or react to something in a way that doesn't require a fully formed idea or any of the other agonies that accompany longer format writing.</p>

<p>Here is a recipe for writing more in this blog. Don't worry about how much you tweet, because you are treating those tweets as the short form of your work. When the muse is silent, go back to your own tweets and see which ones of them deserve to be longer. Even the stereotypical "eating a sandwich" tweet can be stretched into 200 words if you want, by turning that throwaway observation into a recipe. Almost anything worth visiting in 140 characters is worth revisiting in longer form; take advantage of the short form as a stockpile of ideas to pull from when it's time to write longer.</p>

<p>Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It's distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!</p>

<p>Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated. Case in point, a <a href="http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html">hack of Dogewallet</a> caused several people's stash of Dogecoins to vanish into the hands of an as of yet unknown person who managed to get to the file system of the Dogewallet "secure" system and change the destination address for Dogecoin transfers. About 30 million coins were stolen.</p>

<p>Details are on the the <a href="http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html">Dogecoin forum</a>, and I found out about this via Clay Shirky.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious).</p>

<p>The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 lbs sweet potatoes, boiled 7 minutes, peeled, cut into 1" chunks</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 lime</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 orange</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>2 tsp chipotle chili powder</li>
<li>2 cans (15 oz each) of black beans, rinsed well and drained</li>
<li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a dressing of the olive oil, lime juice, orange juice, cumin, chipotle powder; mix well.</p>

<p>Combine the ingredients in a large bowl. I put half the sweet potatoes at the bottom, then one can of beans, then more sweet potatoes, then more beans, with green onions and cilantro at the top. Pour the dressing over and mix.</p>

<p>This works well the next day as leftovers, if you have any!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.</p>

<p>Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers.</p>

<p>A useful mechanism of self-guidance for me is to ensure that every post fits into at least one existing category. It doesn't help that I have to date created <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/archives.html">two hundred and thirty eight categories</a> into which something might fit. That at least is honest; this weblog doesn't have one narrow focus, and it's been running for ten years, so some divergence of interests is not just anticipated but expected.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" title="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The map shows intensity of the ice storm on a scale from 0 (little impact) to 5 (catastrophic damage). The index incorporates measures of rainfall (as ice), wind, and temperatures to come up with an aggregate measure. Washtenaw County's forecast is a 0, but to the north (Livingston) and west (Jackson) counties there are chances for more severe icing. The forecast gives the worst hit to upstate New York along Lake Ontario; alas this map does not show Canadian forecasts, but <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/21/severe-weather-warnings-sweep-across-all-of-central-and-eastern-canada-travel-threatened/">news accounts</a> predict severe weather in Toronto as well.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.</p>

<p>For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. That's why when a proper obituary is written I like to cut and paste it out of wherever it has been and post it here. It seems that unless you do that the words so carefully and lovingly written disappear, either into the unsearchable maw of Facebook or into the tattered yellow clippings of a typical newspaper obituary site. You'll see a few of them in the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/obituaries">obituaries</a> category here.</p>

<p>I've written previously about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/07/facebook-and-obituaries.html">Facebook and obituaries</a>, so this is more a reminder and a capture of a few thoughts than something earth-shakingly new. I have to wonder how the net will evolve over time and whether some hip new service of the moment will transform into something that people use to share their time of grief.</p>

<p>No, I don't know either why Jackson Road is labelled as US-12. More details of the City of Ann Arbor plowing program at <a href="http://a2gov.org/snow">http://a2gov.org/snow</a>.</p>

<p>How much snow did we get? The National Weather Service map says about 6 inches in Ann Arbor.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I use <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> (see: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html">previously</a>) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the projects pile up, and I forget what I was doing but still don't know what to focus on. The mindfulness project then is to go methodically through each of the tabs, dealing with whatever is on that page and then closing the tab instead of saving it. This has been a good way to feel like I don't have an infinite set of half-done efforts.</p>

<p>This map (one of many on the site) shows the overlap of what people map out when they say they are from Detroit. The densest is the downtown region only; the most generous encompasses a 9-county region. From Alex B. Hill, <a href="http://detroitography.com/2013/11/29/100-maps-of-detroit/">100 Maps of Detroit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I chose to look at the first 100 images that appeared in a Google image search for “map of Detroit” and overlay the results. Many corporations based in Southfield, Warren, or Dearborn choose to say they are based in “Detroit,” Likewise, most regional organizations (Detroit Chamber, Detroit Water &amp; Sewage, SEMCOG, etc.) represent Detroit with boundaries that extend into surrounding municipalities, most commonly the tri-counties (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb). A number of the 100 maps show urban sprawl to varying degrees while some maps categorize municipalities around the city as “Detroit.” Some maps even included parts of Windsor, Ontario in the “metro Detroit” area. The larger boundaries match the Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as outlined by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which represent “Detroit” as either a 6 county area (MSA) or a 9 county area (CSA).</p>
