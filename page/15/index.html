<h2 id="things-yet-to-do-in-this-weblog-setup:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Things yet to do in this weblog setup:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs etc</li>
</ul>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-21-contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager/">Contactually, an early review of this contact manager</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m on a 30 day trial of <a href="http://www.contactually.com"
target="_self">Contactually</a>, a contact manager that seems to
handle one important function only: reminding you to follow up
periodically with people who are important to you.</p>

<p>On the plus side, it does a good job of importing data from my
Google account and from a handful of social media sites, and by
doing so the amount of manual labor needed to do something with it
is kept to a minimum. New contacts are created by it watching your
inbox.</p>

<p>On the minus side, its sense of creating reminders depends on
creating buckets of similar contacts to be reminded on a similar
schedule, and the process of putting a living, breathing, complex
human being into exactly one bucket is difficult if not impossible
to do completely. They try to make a game of it, which at least
lets you speed through decisions, but it&rsquo;s still a difficult
task.</p>

<p>Once you have someone in a bucket it pulls a few of
them out of that bucket every so often and reminds you to follow
up with them. You can mark someone as followed up via email or
through some other method, so it will keep track of phone calls or
in-person meetings or whatever if you need to.</p>

<p>When I used to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_ACT!" target="_self">ACT</a>!, once upon a long time ago, I was better at following up with people because I kept track of when I last contacted people. I&#39;m always surprised that native contact managers don&#39;t have a field that they keep updated for &quot;last contacted&quot; that can easily be sorted and will automatically be populated from other things that the system knows. ACT! never made it into my Internet world successfully, but I still remember its ideas.&#0160;</p>

<p>Contactually is interesting, in the way that every single new contact manager is interesting. The price point is $0/mo (for a cut-down version), $20/mo (for what I have now), and $99/mo/user (for an enterprise version that I have no interest in). At $20/mo I had better be able to point to $1000/mo in new value coming from this, and based on the experience to date, I can&#39;t say yet that it&#39;s worthwhile to me at that price point. But I like the idea - hey, let your computer unearth some long-lost friends to remind you to chat with from time to time! I&#39;m just not sure that I couldn&#39;t get the same results by taking my contact list, putting it in a file, and then generating a <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools/blob/master/randomline" target="_self">random line in the file</a> to inspire me.</p>

<p>In this lecture on &quot;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Syndicate,&quot; speaker Jon Udell will review a case study — conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere — that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.</p>
<p>Udell is an author, information architect, software developer, and new media innovator. In 2007 Udell joined Microsoft Research as a writer, interviewer, speaker, and experimental software developer. Currently he is building and explaining a calendar network that&#39;s based on open standards and runs in the Windows Azure cloud.</p>
<p>His 1999 book,&#0160;<em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>, helped lay the foundation for what we now call social software. Udell was formerly a software developer at Lotus,&#0160;<em>BYTE</em>&#0160;magazine&#39;s executive editor and Web maven, and an independent consultant.</p>
<p>A hands-on thinker, Udell&#39;s analysis of industry trends has always been informed by his own ongoing experiments with software, information architecture, and new media.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2006 he was&#0160;<em>InfoWorld&#39;s</em>&#0160;lead analyst, author of the weekly Strategic Developer column, and blogger-in-chief. During his&#0160;<em>InfoWorld</em>&#0160;tenure he also pioneered the medium now known as screencasting and produced an audio show, Interviews with Innovators.</p>
<p>Udell provided the following abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;In&#0160;<em>Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read</em>&#0160;(1955), Rudolf Flesch ranted that &#39;horrible, stupid, emasculated, pointless, tasteless little readers&#39; were depriving kids of &#39;<em>Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>The Arabian Nights</em>&#0160;and Mark Twain, and anything interesting and worthwhile.&#39; He&#0160; argued: &#39;If you equip kids with the right conceptual tools they can read anything.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;As we colonize the cloud we can read — and write — in important new ways. But we&#39;re failing to equip most people with the right conceptual tools for these emerging modes of literacy. A web of connected information systems entails such concepts as authority over data, indirection, standard ways to structure and exchange data, controlled vocabularies, publish-and-subscribe networks, and use and recombination of services.</p>
<p>&quot;Students of the computer and information sciences learn and apply these principles. Others can too, but because they mostly don&#39;t they remain stuck at a &#39;Fun with Dick and Jane&#39; level of Web literacy.</p>
<p>&quot;In this talk we&#39;ll review a case study, conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere, that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013.</p>
<p>From NPR, the FAA is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/16/169555027/faa-grounds-all-787-planes-in-the-u-s-to-seek-a-fix-for-battery-issue" target="_self">grounding 787s because of battery problems</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston.</em></p>
<p>What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020149011_787batterydamagexml.html" target="_self">according to the Seattle Times</a>:</p>
<p><em>Hot chemicals sprayed out of the battery on the 787 Dreamliner in this week’s emergency landing in Japan, leaving a gooey dark residue and suggesting a different malfunction than last week’s 787 battery fire in Boston, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21054089" target="_self">BBC</a>&#0160;gives the detail in a timeline:</p>
<p><em><strong>15 January:</strong>&#0160;ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube is forced to land shortly after take-off due to battery problems. The airline grounds all its 17 Dreamliners. Japan Airlines follows suit, grounding its fleet of seven 787s</em></p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.piersystem.com/external/content/document/1914/1683411/1/SJC%20ANA%20update.pdf" target="_self">more detail from the San Jose airport</a>, which has flights affected by the cancellations:</p>
<p>Statement from ANA released 1/16/13: <br />ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube to Haneda made an emergency landing at Takamatsu <br />Airport at 8.47am on Wednesday, 16 January due to a technical problem. The aircraft’s <br />instruments registered a problem related to a battery and crew also detected an unusual smell in <br />the cabin and the cockpit. All 137 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft. The <br />event was registered as a serious incident by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and <br />Tourism (MLIT). ANA will cooperate fully with the Japan Transport Safety Board, relevant <br />authorities, and Boeing to investigate the cause of the incident. All ANA flights operated by <br />Boeing 787 have been cancelled on 16 January 2013. <br />January 16, 2013<br />All Nippon Airways, Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Reuters notes that <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS_Yuasa" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="GS Yuasa">GS Yuasa</a> makes the battery, and its stock took a hit. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-boeing-dreamliner-gsyuasabre90g01h-20130116,0,6174042.story" target="_self">Reuters via Chicago Tribune</a>:</p>
<p><em>TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of GS Yuasa Corp shed 5.9 percent to 302 yen on Thursday after All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said the main battery on the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BA" rel="googlefinance" target="_blank" title="NYSE: BA">Boeing</a>&#39;s 787 Dreamliner that made an emergency landing on Wednesday was discolored and there were signs of leakage.</em></p>
<p>In happier times, here was the press release about the Lithium ion batteries from GS Yuasa:</p>
<p><em>June 12, 2005, Thales will incorporate the latest lithium-ion technology from Japan’s leading battery manufacturer, GS Yuasa, in the Electrical Power Conversion System of Boeing’s next generation commercial airliner, the 787 Dreamliner. The multi-year, multi-million dollar contract is a historic first as it marks the first commercial aviation application of Li-ion technology anywhere in the world.</em></p>
<p>And, after a bunch of digging, here&#39;s a really good analysis of <a href="http://www.avweb.com/blogs/insider/AVwebInsider_DreamlinerFire_207979-1.html" target="_self">The Dreamliner&#39;s Battery Fire</a>, by Paul Bertorelli on AVweb. Worth reading through the whole thing for an insight into why this is a big issue for Boeing. Emphasis added.</p>
<p><em>This is serious stuff for Boeing and could put a significant dent in the airplane&#39;s certification basis if they can&#39;t figure out a solution. When Boeing proposed the Dreamliner a decade ago, it spec&#39;d lithium-ion batteries for the airplane&#39;s innovative electrical power conversion system, which is made by Thales, with batteries from Yuasa. The airplane can also use conventional NiCad cells but either way, batteries provide starting energy for the APU and back-up power for other systems. At the time, the hazards of Li-ion were known, but Boeing wanted the weight savings and power density that only Li-ion can offer. Working with the FAA, it developed new certification standards for batteries under so-called special conditions. That required sophisticated electronics to provide overcharge and charge imbalance protection and physical thermal containment. Taken together and on paper, those precautions look more than robust enough to meet the stringent safety requirements of a modern airliner.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Well, maybe not</strong>. When I was researching Li-ion batteries for aircraft last year, I heard real concerns that the Li-ion main ship/starting battery risk wasn&#39;t yet well understood.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-15-storing-something-somewhere-you-can-remember-it/">storing something somewhere you can remember it</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p>Not so much &quot;where did I put my glasses&quot;, but &quot;how do I make sure that I find something the next time I&#39;m looking for it online&quot;. A piece of it is also &quot;how do other people find it when they&#39;re looking for it&quot;, but for this exercise it&#39;s the personal search pattern and not the global search pattern that matters.</p>
<p>My current workflow admits multiple patterns for doing this, and I suspect that the answer to my question is to do more than one save, depending on how important it is to save something. I&#39;ll take them in order.</p>
<p>1. Write something down in my blog. There&#39;s only about 2000 posts here, which is much smaller than the size of the net, and so I should be able to refind it if I&#39;ve blogged about it. The corresponding search is either a keyword search through Google with the refinement &quot;site:vielmetti.typepad.com&quot; or a search through the Typepad dashboard back end.</p>
<p>2. Save it to Pinboard. (Previously, this would have been save it to Delicious). I have about 18000 bookmarks there, mostly from a couple of years ago, and many of them have good tags and good text to search through. Pinboard is a rich source of the sort of stuff I like, but retrieval depends on carefully grooming the tags you apply every time you get back a search.</p>
<p>3. Post to Twitter. Twitter&#39;s searching tools are lousy, but I have about 3000 followers, and if I send out anything good chances are someone else will remember it. Twitter is promising a personal search and when they get it the system will seem less write-mostly and will help me figure out which sandwiches I like and which buses have squeaky brakes. As a bonus, my Twitter posts are being archived to Pinboard so there&#39;s a fighting chance I can look it up again there.</p>
<p>4. Post to Facebook. Facebook seems to be write-mostly, read-little, but again there&#39;s the ever-promising search improvements that will support unlikely syntaxes like &quot;people who like sandwiches who live near Oshkosh&quot;. If I ever need to do a search like that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find it.</p>
<p>5. Save to Evernote. I only have a tiny amount of stuff there, but it&#39;s saving full text of things more so than just pointers, and so the search experience is richer. I wonder if I can coerce Pinboard to do more things so that I&#39;m less tempted by Evernote.</p>
<p>6. Write on Arborwiki, or some other narrowly focused wiki. This works best for things you want to remember that don&#39;t have to have your name attached to it. If I&#39;m salting away details about the local environment, Arborwiki has about 10000 existing pages to add to, and that&#39;s enough to make it worthwhile to make incremental improvements to.</p>
<p>The common elements here seem to be scale - a system is appealing when it has at least a few thousand elements already in it, but not so huge like Wikipedia where any individual contribution is washed out by the enormity of the whole. It&#39;s nice to have non-Google places to put things where the search language and syntax has a bit more finesse, especially if there&#39;s a backup plan to use Google as well.&#0160;</p>

<p>I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labelled.</p>
<p>Then, when you want to surprise someone with a plausible association, or bring someone to mind who had been lost to mind, you shuffle the rolodex and unearth the connections that had disappeared but that because of your graph will reappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course &quot;rolodex&quot; will never show up in a Facebook press release, and the fact that I even mention it makes me look old.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR (January 13, 2013, 11:06 pm) - A fire at a 6 unit apartment building at 1310 Packard in Ann Arbor sent 6 people to the hospital, all in stable condition, <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290656100750073856" target="_self">according to a report</a> from Michigan Daily reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam" target="_self">Sam Gringlas</a> who is on the scene and who spoke with Huron Valley Ambulance spokeswoman Joyce Williams. A <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290646279883718656/photo/1" target="_self">photograph</a> from the reporter shows smoke billowing out of a window.</p>
<p>At 9:13 p.m. the fire was reportedly &quot;fully involved&quot;, and fire dispatch (monitored via scanner) called for mutual aid assistance. Units from multiple neighboring jurisdictions including Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township came to the scene.</p>
<p>Packard is blocked between Wells and Brooklyn, and motorists should seek alternative routes.</p>
<p>The building was <a href="http://www.commercialiq.com/listing/2378234" target="_self">listed for sale</a>, with an asking price of $550,000, on CommercialIQ.</p>
<p>The building is owned by The High-way Company Interational LLC,&#0160;Bashar J Abdulsattar as registered agent.</p>
<p>For further information, see a more complete <a href="http://www.michigandaily.com/news/apartment-complex-engulfed-flames-packard" target="_self">story from the Michigan Daily</a>, which has filed their report at of 1:10 a.m. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system.</p>
<p>Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &quot;item&quot;) and the subsequent responses. Items and responses have numbers, so that you can refer unambiguously to 6:23 and someone can go back and read that. Conferences have names, and membership in a conference is controlled down to the individual level if the organizer so desires.</p>
<p>A typical Confer conference either had a very narrow, focused point of view with a set of people trying to tackle some specific issue, or a general point of view open to all comers with very little restriction on the topics. A conference might be open ended, or it could be shut down after a decided on period of time when the work was concluded.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use weblogs like Confer, sorta kinda, but they give relatively too much power to the blog owner (the person who authors posts, or &quot;items&quot;) in shaping the discussion. My words are always at the top of the page, which doesn&#39;t always make for good dialog. Group blogs help somewhat, though there&#39;s still an editorial focus that doesn&#39;t feel like a conference.</p>
<p>Private Facebook groups, especially those that are carefully tended, come closer to Confer behavior. You have the same item and response structure, and a similar level of control over who participates. The biggest issue is that old Facebook posts scroll off into the mists of time, and it&#39;s hard to have a lot of conversations going on at once without overwhelming the board. This contrasts with Confer where judicious use of the &quot;forget&quot; command could keep one noisy item from overwhelming the whole thing.</p>
<p>Finally, of all things, the Github &quot;issues&quot; board has a very similar structure to Confer, with items (&quot;issues&quot;) and responses neatly threaded. It has some of the less-used abilities of Confer to categorize and organize items, plus a well thought-out cross reference facility so that a link to another issue is easy to turn into something that you can click through.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve gone from an era of computing scarcity to an era of embarrassing plenty.&#0160;What&#39;s missing from everything is the sense that this mainframe that you were typing at was the only thing that was absorbing everyone&#39;s online attention, and that there really wasn&#39;t anything else that had the same density of local contacts and connections. The Internet is chockablock with online discussion and sharing systems looking to capture a piece of your daily energy, with more coming all the time. The era of the centralized mainframe with the centralized discussion board is over, no matter how compelling the features of its time seemed to be.&#0160;</p>

      <p>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)</p>
<p>This week&#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college. The answers ranged from selling pots and pans door to door to selling ice cream in Manhattan to running a student bus company to programming PDP-8 computers. One person was there who was in college now and he talked about his startup that connects bands with bars.</p>
<p>The technology of the week was the notice that <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michiganterminalsystem/discussions/mts-today/6mtsrunningonaraspberrypi" target="_self">the Michigan Terminal System has been made to work on the ultra-small Raspberry Pi system</a>. A photo shows the setup.</p>

<p>Organizing an event that happens every week is easy, especially when the venue is open. All you have to do is show up every single week, invite anyone you can find, and make sure that if someone arrives twice that you remember their name. It helps if you happen to be part of a community where people have learned to communicate online for a long time, and where the online community and the in-person community dovetail nicely.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Connecting William Street is a redevelopment project that the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is working on to make better use of properties which are currently surface parking lots. The grand plan envisions relatively dense development on these lots.</p>
<p>For background reading see the <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/current_projects/a2p5_/" target="_self">DDA site for Connecting William Street</a>, the <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/tag/Connecting%20William%20Street/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com coverage of Connecting William Street</a>, and &#0160;the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/tag/connecting-william-street/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle coverage of Connecting William Street</a>. If you&#39;re coming at it from scratch, expect to spend about an hour chewing on the debates to date. Or, you could be like most people and not really care to read every excruciating detail of every minor functionary&#39;s opinions on the project, and every excruciating opinion from the pseudonymous commenter crowd. </p>
<p>William Street is not a fun street to walk down, especially compared to Liberty Street one block over. There&#39;s not a density of retail that makes window shopping appealing, and two entire blocks are given over to parking. The question is whether municipal intervention in the planning process can enliven this area and at the same time generate a return on the investment in the land that&#39;s better than what parking can provide.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with William Street, and one that no easy planning process can address, is the horrible car-pedestrian interface at the Fourth and William parking structure. Cars enter and exit to the sidewalk without much in the way of sight lines to help avoid collisions, and it&#39;s a busy enough structure that if you go from Main to Fourth past the structure you&#39;re bound to have to make a quick step to preserve your good health. No matter what else you do with all of the other properties, there&#39;s still going to be a barrier that separates Main Street from points to the east, and anyone with a choice as to where to walk is going to detour towards Liberty.</p>
<p>Build all you want, but the giant hulk of a parking structure smack in the middle of your development effort is going to overshadow any attempts you make to build a pleasant streetscape.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m irritated when so-called newspapers fill their pages by rewriting stories from other newspapers. It&#39;s worst when the rewrite is as long as the original and contains no new reporting, just regurgitage.</p>
<p>A typical example:</p>
<p><a href="http://dexter.patch.com/articles/dexter-township-permanent-fire-station-on-hold-while-board-discusses-alternate-land-option" target="_self">Dexter Patch writes a story</a> about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station. <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/dexter/plans-for-permanent-fire-substation-on-hold-in-dexter-township-after-property-sold/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com follows up with the same story</a>, too lazy even to call any of the officials named in the story to get its own quote.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not an unusual day to see fully half of the &quot;news&quot; in AnnArbor.com being cribbed from some other source.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet/">What is the goal of the Internet?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that the Internet is a very large, elaborate, multi-player game. What are its winning conditions?
<p>
0. Make money fast. That proves to be difficult, but it&#39;s been pitched so many times that it should go up front first. If you can&#39;t make money quickly, then at least make the promise that you are growing something that will eventually make money even if it&#39;s not making money now.</p>
<p>
1. Increase the n. Find something of desire, and add to it. Games built into social network services (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) behave this way, all in somewhat different details but all measured by simple increases in how many things you collect. Lots of systems have naive but effective ways of prompting you to continue simply by helping you count how much you have played so far.</p>
<p>
2. Reduce the hop count. This is a network game players point of view, most easily visible to those with experience playing in the UUCP and Internet routing networks, but also to a certain degree on high-degree social networks. Find something far away of desire, and work systematically to bring it closer. For an added bonus, make the online equivalent of a back stage pass that quickly gets you access to a sense of intimacy that you would otherwise have to earn.</p>
<p>
3. Decrease the n. Like Sisyphus, we work to reduce the size of our inbox daily. The seasonal holiday of Discardia is a good time to do a purge of whatever we no longer treasure, to make room for the things that are awesome. Good writing includes good editing, which means omitting needless words. At a social extreme are the deletionist Wikipedians, who believe that a better encyclopedia doesn&#39;t include marginal and unimportant articles.</p>
<p>
4. Reduce mean time to response. A well developed network gets a prompt, smart, generous response to queries. That&#39;s hard to keep up 24x7, but when you are on you can be exceptional in your ability to gain trust. &quot;The courtesy of a prompt response is appreciated.&quot;</p>
<p>
5. Increase bandwidth. It&#39;s always better to have more bits streaming in, even if you aren&#39;t using them all at once. The same goes for screen size and screen resolution - you can never have enough.</p>
<p>
6. Reduce latency and lag. From first-person shooters to international video chat, lag and latency are your enemy. Work as hard as possible to trim milliseconds from your enviroment so that you can enjoy it in real time.</p>
<p>
7. Increase the size of the lunch table. If you are having lunch with friends, you want the size of the table to fill the venue without overflowing. The restaurant will love you if you keep it full, and you&#39;ll have that many more people to appreciate and think of.</p>
<p>
8. Collect badges and prizes. Amassing credentials is a part of any good game, whether it be Foursquare mayorships at the local cafe or college degrees or professional certificates. Play the game until you prove that you have won it.</p>
<p>9. Be the first to experience something. Whether it&#39;s making the first comment on a post, writing the first review of a new product, or going to a restaurant on opening night, the person who has the quick draw on the hot new item wins. There&#39;s a benefit for novelty and being part of the in crowd that knows what&#39;s new.</p>
<p>10. Outlast your rivals. Slow, plodding diligence is enough to win some races, where you simply wait for your counterparts to give up on the game that you&#39;re playing. Your ability to keep at a task year upon year means that eventually your gray hair will be a mark of your genius, just because there&#39;s no one else around to challenge your version of the story.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It doesn&#39;t run on 10.5.8, so I&#39;m holding this review until after I upgrade to 10.6.</p>
<p>It didn&#39;t work on 10.6.8 either, just coming up with a &quot;Loading&quot; screen that hangs their seemingly forever. I&#39;m on an early 2008 MacBook, certainly not the fastest computer in the world, but one that is usually adequate to the task of running most software.</p>
<p>After prompt help from Bluestacks tech support, I tried again, this time first closing my Chrome browser windows before starting. Lo and behold, it fired up promptly. The diagnosis &#0160;was &quot;not enough memory&quot;, and sure enough once I turned off my browser there was enough memory left to get it to start.</p>
<p>From all I could tell of using the system with one app loaded (Twitter), it was a faithful emulation of the Android environment. There&#39;s an app store or two so that you can get new stuff. But once I started to load more than one app at a time, the system started to bog down again, and the output from &quot;top&quot; showed a load average of 7+ and no free system memory.</p>
<p>I&#39;m willing concede that it might work on some computers, but it&#39;s not working well enough on mine to be anything but a curiousity. It certainly can&#39;t run on this system at the same time as my browser. There is hope that a future release will be more sparing of memory, in which case I&#39;ll give it another try.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-deletionism-or-the-grim-reaper/">Deletionism, or the grim reaper</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There is a tremendous appeal to the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/06/15/Deletionist-Morons">deletionist</a> point of view.
<p>
I spent some time this evening improving Wikipedia by suggesting that some of its less well written articles be removed. The task was relatively simple; hit the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">random page</a>&quot; button, read the article, decide if it is so horrible as to be unencyclopedic, and if it is then paste in the &quot;please delete this&quot; template and hope for the best.
</p>
<p>
Combing through a series of random pages on Wikipedia is more grim than I had expected. Many of the articles were very short, to the typical tune of &quot;X is a village with 42 inhabitants&quot; or &quot;Y was an indifferent soccer player on a minor league team&quot;. A surprising number of articles were years old and read &quot;Z will be a television series on a minor television network&quot; with no one bothering to follow up to see whether the series was kept or cancelled.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t always been a deletionist. There was a time when you&#39;d find me in Wikipedia more often than not improving some minor but notable page to make it incrementally better in the hopes that it would not be deleted, or arguing to keep some minimally important article from being deleted. The experience of working through random pages was sufficiently enlightening about the general quality of the work there that it seemed more productive to argue instead to wipe out some of the less well considered contributions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com">My weblog</a> is similarly full of indifferent contributions, posts which seem to have been a good idea at the time but which don&#39;t have much to argue for themselves now. For a long time I had a habit of writing very short and poorly edited posts just in order to get something out quickly, and I&#39;d love to revisit those and improve them by taking them offline.
</p>
<p>
A help to solid improvement of a large body of work is some way to randomly index your way through the system and work on the next random piece that comes up in front of you. The standard Typepad system does not have any sort of &quot;random post&quot; structure, so I&#39;ll need to somehow improvise. What I think I can do is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/import_export.html">export the entire contents of my blog</a>, write a script to pull out just the titles and URLs of the posts, then generate something that pulls a random line from that list. If I can do that then I can go back randomly and be ruthless in pruning out things that don&#39;t belong any more.
</p>
<p>
Ideally there&#39;s some basis for the notion that rather than writing new words all the time, I should be looking at ways of improving some of the old ones instead. That germ of a good idea, half explored in 150 words 5 years ago, might make a good 750 word essay now. That poorly executed quick post of 7 years ago might be deleted to make room for a better issue now. No one will miss the old words, and I might be able to free up space in my memory for something more positive.
</p>
<p>
The deletionist point of view, when applied too aggressively, can also be pretty grim. The grim reaper decides that one person&#39;s hard work is unworthy of inclusion and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers">attacks everything they do</a> until that contributor goes away. If you get hit by a deletionist of that type, your only best approach is to move your contributions to some other medium where you can contribute without attracting undue attention.
</p>
<p>
My randomized approach to editorial review is much more like the &quot;<a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html">chaos monkey</a>&quot; used by some cloud-based online services to ensure that their carefully constructed and complicated system is resilient in the case of failure. The chaos monkey takes down parts of a redundant system at random, forcing it to respond in the way that systems designers had planned for an outage. Because you are exercising the failures in a controlled way you can be prepared for uncontrolled failure at some future time.
</p>
<p>
I was able to download the entire blog corpus, and to write <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools/blob/master/randomline">the little script that pulled out a random title from the total</a>. It&#39;s now also time to start doing other textual analysis on this word-hoard, looking for words that are used unusually frequently, or subjects that come up more often than I had imagined. With the right tool set there should be lots of good meta-information that I can reuse and turn into new ideas. After all, there&#39;s more than a decade worth of stuff buried in almost 10 megabytes of text, and I&#39;m sure that at least 10% of it is deletable without the slightest loss to anyone.

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-01-a-salute-to-oulipo-providing-inspiration-since-my-keyboard-is-missing-a-key-and-i-wonder-if-anyone-w/">A salute to Oulipo, providing inspiration since my keyboard is missing a key and I wonder if anyone will notice if I don&#39;t use it</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A France-based school of writing called &quot;<a href="http://www.nous.org.uk/oulipo.html" target="_self">Oulipo</a>&quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/as-easy-as-abc-georges-perec-once-wrote-a-whole-novel-without-the-letter-e-kevin-jackson-summarises-an-oulipian-life-in-26-sentences-1420994.html" target="_self">an entire novel </a>written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format.
<p>
A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. A little nubbin under a <a href="http://www.thebookyard.com/apple_keycaps.php" target="_self">keycap</a> still works, so I can use an &quot;h&quot; regardless, albeit a bit more slowly and self-consciously. Imagine writing, every time you use a particular letter your finger got a tactile reminder of a letter you were using is special, and you&#39;re pretty close to my result.
</p>
<p>
If I were in an Oulipoean mood, I&#39;d write exclusively omitting a letter from my text, and compose words only missing it. Absent a definite article, my efforts will refer only to one of many possible versions of a work, and never pin it down to a particular one. It&#39;s not so difficult, so long as you are willing to investigate synonyms as you run into words requiring a forbidden letter.
</p>
<p>
A style of Oulipo allows a writer to be self aware of a constraint, and to comment on it as one goes about doing work of writing. Formal restrictions on your work force you into creative patterns omitting or adding certain types of typical constructions. It also slows you down quite a bit, since a forbidden letter at a center of a keyboard is always a tempting target, and a large void to be avoided.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad for a task of needing to do some interesting avoidance of a key. It is a distraction from a temporary and transient annoyance, sure to be solved by a trip to a nearby <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/briarwood/" target="_self">Genius Bar</a>, a place of keycap magic. I was careful to save all parts lost in my endeavor to do a self repair, alas at least one of my magic bits of plastic may be broken. I&#39;m certain a fine Apple employee will be able to set it back to its original state.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to keep your own voice as you try to write and always skip a missing key?  Writing is like talking to a page, and if you are required to omit a fraction of your vocabulary as you do it, a great bit of easy spontaneity is lost. Surprisingly, a key in question albeit a frequently used one is not difficult to type around. A real obstacle is a need to be indefinite about objects referred to, but it is not impossible, just strange.
</p>
<p>
In general, a world we live in always admits a possibility of doing well by not always possessing precisely an item we are used to. If a car is not working, it&#39;s easier to take a bus, walk, or bicycle. If power goes out, we visit our friends from next door more easily. Dietary restrictions like a ban on milk products spur creation of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/04/vegan_chocolate.html" target="_self">delicious vegan treats</a>. It&#39;s not always easy to make a transition away from routines, but new routines fall into place as backups to our usual well trodden ways.
</p>
<p>
I am writing in <a href="http://750words.com" target="_self">750 words</a>, a clever tool in its way of keeping track of not just words being typed but also sentiment and tone of a piece of prose. Seven score more words to write, and it&#39;s starting to feel like a burden just to get out words to make sense. So far a difficulty is a feeling of disjointedness, not so difficult to come to decisions on individual words, but connecting words are strangely missing and require odd constructions to work around. In a way, it&#39;s a struggle just to make sense at all. Of course it&#39;s also a bit late, and I&#39;m tired, and it&#39;s a new year of its own.
</p>
<p>
My struggle is not a unique one in our family, as one additional keyboard is also missing keys. I believe a &quot;c&quot; and an &quot;x&quot; are missing from said keyboard, again posing compositional difficulties of late as I am led to believe. Working your way around a void is at first a struggle, until you obtain a pattern and meter allowing you to carry on regardless. I&#39;ll feel quite a bit better as soon as a new &quot;h&quot; key is put into place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details.
<p>
I&#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&#39;s stumped me before. I&#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked.
</p>
<p>
The key bit which I didn&#39;t use before was a screwdriver. The particular tub in question has an overflow hatch which holds the drain plug lifter, and by using a screwdriver I was able to disassemble that hatch and remove a gizmo and then, once all the pieces were apart, I could use the plastic drain snake to get at the hair clog. (Ew.) About ten minutes after starting work on the project today, the drain ran free. Hooray!
</p>
<p>
How hard can it be to clear a drain? Well, the challenge is to have the right combination of the time to work on it, the necessary tools, the insight as to what all you might try new that you hadn&#39;t tried before, and a determination not to allow a temporary setback to slow you down. Don&#39;t have a screwdriver? A quarter and a vise grip make an adequate substitute. That fancy drain snake you tried before didn&#39;t work out so well? Visit the hardware store and see what other designs there are.
</p>
<p>
What makes this project different from most is that it had been waiting months to complete, months where I stood in the shower with the water accumulating wondering how I was going to fix the problem, months where various other attempts to fix didn&#39;t work out so well.
</p>
<p>
I suppose that a lot of problems we run into look like this. The head on approach with a simple set of tools fails to fix the problem, we&#39;re frustrated by the results, and then the situation languishes for a long time without any headway. Some day you look at the problem with fresh eyes and get an aha! insight that transforms the issue from one thing into something completely different, and the fresh attack hits the transformed problem and it clears up quickly.
</p>
<p>
The unsuccessful problem-solving of the day was a friend&#39;s snow blower, which had sat for an entire winter last year unused and thus we think has bad gas in the tank. The obvious approaches of trying the electric starter and the pull starter failed to result in the motor catching, and so the best guess is that draining the gas tank and refilling with fresh fuel will be the right way to solve the problem. This of course transforms the problem from &quot;start the snowblower&quot; to &quot;refill the gas tank of the snowblower&quot; and assumes that all of the starter motors work just fine and they do seem to.
</p>
<p>
I really should be able to tackle more straightforward tasks head on. There&#39;s a temptation to write down the task before addressing it, and then turning the written down task into something which is a subject of some endless refinement. So often it would be easier just to decide to tackle something and do it than to sort through an infinite list of possible tasks saying &quot;no, not now, later&quot; over and over again. It is not always obvious which things are straightforward and which will take hours or weeks of work.
</p>
<p>
Often the best way to get something done is to simply say that you&#39;re not going to stop until it&#39;s complete, sit down, get comfortable in working on it, and then grind through the problem until it has reached a single satisfactory answer. Deciding which one thing to do can be harder than getting that one thing done.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-30-some-reflection-on-use-of-github-as-an-issue-tracker-two-weeks-in/">Some reflection on use of Github as an issue tracker, two weeks in</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Two weeks ago, I started <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">using Github as an issue tracker</a> to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&#39;s some reflection on that use.
<p>
I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order. I&#39;ve tried <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/noguchi_filing_.html" target="_self">systems on paper</a>, a bunch of electronic systems, various gizmos, you name it I&#39;ve probably either done it or considered it. There&#39;s a piece of me that expects that this is a temporary enthusiasm and that I&#39;ll be printing out some of this before I close my Github account down. But while that temporary enthusiasm lasts, it&#39;s been a pretty good run.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried to work the process in parallel with an &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/getting_to_inbo.html" target="_self">inbox zero</a>&quot; approach of getting tasks out of my inbox and into my issue tracker. At the moment the inbox is down to five, and it&#39;s probably ten minutes work to get it back to zero. It&#39;s been nice not having an infinite inbox to plow through, and often that has meant that when there&#39;s a quick answer to something that I can dash it off and get back to zero status for a while. That feels good.
</p>
<p>
As I&#39;ve used the system what has evolved into a routine is labeling each task, so that everything has a proper color code. &quot;Housekeeping&quot; is bright yellow, &quot;finance&quot; is green, &quot;connect&quot; is blue, and so forth. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/04/radial-categorization-and-the-trouble-with-tags.html" target="_self">Obtaining sensible and non-overlapping categories is a challenge</a>, and that will probably continue to evolve slowly over time. An item can be in more than one category and it&#39;s easy to switch categories so there&#39;s no burden of getting it wrong permanently.
</p>
<p>
The goal in these categories is to identify some kind of balance among all of the various things I&#39;m trying to take on and not to let any one part of my efforts get out of line with the others. For example, earlier this week I noticed that the &quot;finance&quot; category had 11 outstanding tasks and 2 completed tasks, whereas the &quot;connect&quot; category had twice as many completed tasks as outstanding. If things are going to pile up in my life, I want them to pile up evenly, and it&#39;s always reasonable to look at the category with the most tasks and do a quick review and see if there&#39;s anything easy to lop off.
</p>
<p>
A memorable success in this ongoing struggle to keep things in order is the ongoing task of cleaning the basement, which somehow went from being tidy to being a mess over the last few years, and which is inhabited by way too much in the way of dead electronics. A whole string of tech support tasks were gated behind being able to get a good backup of my Mac, and in the process of cleaning the basement I realized that I had a Firewire cable entangled in amongst dozens of old and useless power adapters. A bit of cable unsnagging and I was able to plow through <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/technology-upgrades-are-a-tedious-but-necessary-task.html" target="_self">half a dozen system upgrade issues</a> that had piled up, all dependent on one another.
</p>
<p>
Github has a remote access application to its issue tracker from mobile devices, so at least in theory I should be able to manage the list from my smart phone. Alas, issue #1 is &quot;get a new smart phone&quot;, since my elderly Blackberry is more of a dumb phone than anything these days. The Android app is serviceable if a bit clunky feeling, and I&#39;ll see how the iPhone/iPad app compares. In practice it&#39;s not 100% necessary to sync up with tasks the instant they come to mind or are completed, and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2012/08/planning-ahead-as-far-as-you-can-brainstorm-story-ideas.html" target="_self">paper still comes in handy</a> when compiling the short list of things to do next or brainstorming new ideas that might eventually get done.
</p>
<p>
Of course I haven&#39;t done everything I set out to do; no one could. What I figure is that there&#39;s some happy number somewhere more than 100 and less than 150 of things that I might want to do or need to do soonish, and that if I set my mind to it I can write down enough stuff so that there&#39;s always something easy to pick from that is useful. The harder tasks (that new phone, and all of the choices around it) gravitate to the bottom of the list, and you can sort through the bottom just as easily as you can sort through the top. I&#39;m not convinced that this is the only way or even the best way to feel like I&#39;m staying on top of the world, but it&#39;s really nice and reassuring that I can look at the &quot;closed issues&quot; list and say &quot;yes, I did that&quot;.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-29-technology-upgrades-are-a-tedious-but-necessary-task/">Technology upgrades are a tedious but necessary task</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Technology upgrades are a tedious but necessary task.
<p>
I&#39;m going through this now, with an upgrade from Mac OS 10.5.8 to Mac OS 10.6.8 on my black MacBook. The world decided in its infinite wisdom that <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2599452">10.5 was too old to keep supporting</a>, and so quite a bit of software was starting to break. The promise is that 10.6.x will last a bit longer and keep my old 2008 vintage system running for a while longer.
</p>
<p>
Upgrades are always fraught with peril. In this case, it involved sticking a DVD in the drive, clicking a few times, and then waiting 45 minutes for the system to emerge in newly upgraded status. When you do something like that there&#39;s a lot of faith you have to have that the people who put together the shiny DVD got every last thing right, that they didn&#39;t forget to check some bit somewhere which in your case would turn your computer into a puddle of slag. I know that at some level it&#39;s an irrational fear, yet I&#39;ve bricked my share of hardware in my time and I&#39;ve known the process of operating system upgrades to involve long late-night patching sessions to get everything to work.
</p>
<p>
There was no puddle of slag at the end of my upgrade, just a computer that looked about the same as it did before with no huge obvious changes, just a few cosmetic bits and the promise of future compatibility.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m told that the typical Android phone that&#39;s sold never gets an operating system upgrade from the vendor, and that the usual upgrade path is either to install a completely unsupported hacked up new software load or to scrap the phone and start afresh with new hardware. I haven&#39;t lived in that world yet so I don&#39;t have the experience of others to go through, just the general sense that unless you&#39;re willing to delve into the details of <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">Cyanogenmod</a> that you should be prepared to get a new phone every time your contract runs out.
</p>
<p>
Compared to operating system upgrades, application upgrades are relatively easy and low worry. With most consumer software that&#39;s going through a rev cycle, these days you select &quot;upgrade&quot; from within the app and it magically replaces itself with a slightly newer version. This time I needed to update Chrome, and <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1367288">I had to descend to the operating system and delete one file</a> to make the automated process work just fine.
</p>
<p>
The other task in my grand system upgrade effort has been to try to get <a href="http://bluestacks.com/">BlueStacks</a> running. This is an app that runs Android apps on Mac OS X. It&#39;s in beta, so I have some reason to understand when things don&#39;t go instantly right, but I tried it out anyway and the install failed to come up with a working system within the amount of time I was willing to throw at it.
</p>
<p>
Just because I have part of a 10.6 upgrade done doesn&#39;t mean that the whole thing is ready. The CD ships with 10.6.3, and you have to download a gigabyte-plus combo update to get to 10.6.8. The first time I did this the download was corrupted (?) so I tried  again with success. I don&#39;t understand why, just enough to hit the &quot;yes&quot; button, and to type the error message exactly into Google when the error happens in the hopes that someone else has seen exactly the same problem.
</p>
<p>
What did we do before error messages could be looked up with such precision? Well, for one thing, there was usually some source code lying around so that you could read just what the context was for the error. If there was no source code to be had, then Usenet was sure to have someone who had seen the same failure mode. Google searching for failures just distributes out the task to a broader audience than ever, but there&#39;s still the basic issue that when something goes wrong you have to rely on the goodness of people who are willing to air their systems difficulties in public in the hopes of righting them again.
</p>
<p>
Keeping a system running with current software is an ongoing job. I ended up only being able to do it after digging through a rats-nest tangle of cables in my basement, emerging victorious with a Firewire cable that allowed me to back up the Mac to the point where I was confident enough that I could insert the DVD, click &quot;Yes&quot;, and hope that someone in Cupertino tested every combination of equipment that one single updater was supposed to work on.

This is very similar to the kinds of other daily projects I have been involved in like various <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/walker_tracker_.html" target="_self">pedometer games</a> with goals of daily walking activity or language learning that prompts you for daily use.
<p>
Working on something every single day is hard. There are only so many hours in a day, and the commitment to do one thing at the exclusion of something else is a big one. This gives system designers an extra challenge - they need not only to engage you while you&#39;re working on the system, but also to give you enough fond memories of the system while you&#39;re away from it that you&#39;ll voluntarily come back to it day after day.
</p>
<p>
Part of the challenge is to minimize the friction involved in getting back to something day after day. If you have to go through an elaborate login sequence, it will be all that much harder to want to get involved. Any time wasted in the process is not just a few extra seconds one time but a daily commitment to spend that time, over and over again. Good daily systems have a minimum of rough edges and very little to get in the way of that habit.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an element of gaming in 750 words, the process of accumulating a score and badges that reflect progress that can only be achieved over a long period of daily commitment. Until you get three days in a row in, your system icon is an unformed egg, and the number of people who stay in egg state and never graduate to the next level (a turkey) is substantial. As you grow through the effort of daily activity there are opportunities to decorate your account with more and more bling, status markers that give everyone else a chance to recognize you and distinguish your account from all of the others.
</p>

Naturally, one good way to get added status is to pay for it. Gaming a system quickly leads to monetizing it, since you have a social feedback mechanism that allows people to recognize not just diligence as a sign of their specialness but also the willingness to shake loose some coin in appreciation. So the pattern is simple: build a game that you play for a few minutes each day, reward frequent players with visible signs of their progress, and encourage the devoted ones to add an additional reward that&#39;s easy to purchase and distinctively visible.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been motivated by online games before, but then got to the point where I had to give up on them because the time commitment wasn&#39;t worth the effort spent getting bits of online flair. I appreciated the feedback and liked leveling up but just couldn&#39;t commit beyond a certain level to care more about the whole thing. <a href="http://duolingo.com/#!/vielmetti" target="_self">DuoLingo</a>, for instance, was great for a while (and I got to level 11 in German, woo) but at some point it got to be too much.</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/07/23/mooc-drop-out/" target="_self">dropout</a> in massively online open courses (MOOCs, as they are called). Hundreds of thousands of people will start something, but only a few thousand will finish. It&#39;s very easy to start a multi-day project, but the commitment to come back day after day to finish it is an order of magnitude more exceptional.
</p>
<p>
The alternative to games within systems as a method for reinforcement is to use external rewards from other people. Linda Diane Feldt has talked about how wonderful it is to have used the Android app <a href="http://www.noom.com/cardiotrainer/about.php" target="_self">CardioTrainer</a> to log her workouts. It simply keeps a record of what you have done and records it to Facebook, and doesn&#39;t appear to have an internally exceptional set of elaborate games to prompt you along. What the Facebook connection offers is an opportunity for other people to provide intermittent reinforcement, the random and unexpected &quot;yay&quot; for a good workout that isn&#39;t pre-programmed into the system but comes heartfelt from other people.
</p>
<p>
This is only my second day into 750 words, and I&#39;m not yet at a point to judge it. I like accumulating points as much as anyone, and I like that I can spend a small chunk of time writing instead of playing some other online game and that the result of the effort will be tracked and calculated and commented on favorably, at least by a machine. From time to time I expect to cut and paste these lovely long essays into my weblog after they get a round of edits, and it&#39;s from that effort that I look for the intermittent reinforcement that will most likely keep me going - not that the &quot;turkey&quot; badge isn&#39;t motivating to get through the first week, just that in the long haul the real rewards come from other people.</p>

  <h3>28 December 2012</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-28-750wordscom-a-writing-environment-for-a-daily-writing-exercise/">750words.com - a writing environment for a daily writing exercise</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://750words.com">This system has you writing 750 words each day.
</a>
<p>
I&#39;ve already written 750 words today, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750-words-on-blogging-memory-and-forgetting-ive-been-blogging-for-a-long-time-and-writing-online-for-longer-than-that-27.html" target="_self">a long essay on blogging, forgetting, and remembrance</a>. It was pretty good, and I was pretty happy with it. At one point it was 830 words but I cut it down to size, removing a paragraph and tightening up a few phrases.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the 750 words site is to get you into a habit of writing that many words each and every day. It&#39;s not necessary to publish them, but simply to get them down onto the screen. The technique is similar to the &quot;<a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/" target="_self">morning pages</a>&quot; of The Artist&#39;s Way, but instead of pen and paper you type. By typing for long enough you get over the initial hurdle of getting anything down and instead start to get into a groove of reflection, introspection, creativity and insight. Or so that&#39;s the thought.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not certain that I can keep up with this over the long haul, but it&#39;s an appealing construct to have a simple-minded goal that&#39;s more productive than the alternative of playing solitaire, Flood It, or Sudoku. A Sudoku game eats up 20 minutes, which should be enough time to crank out most of a 750 word essay.
</p>
<p>
Hitting a precise word count improves my prose. I write something that&#39;s too long, and then use some extra time to omit needless words until the total is the correct size. &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/01/fill_the_input_.html" target="_self">Fill the input box exactly</a>&quot; is the mantra, and it serves two masters. First, it allows you to write quickly knowing full well that there will be words to cut when you&#39;re done. Second, it keeps the editorial role in abeyance until the whole piece has been worked to the end. It&#39;s better to cut words only when there are too many of them.
</p>
<p>
The 750 Words writing environment is spare. There&#39;s no formatting, no linking, no permalinks to worry about and no readers. It&#39;s just you on the page, typing away madly with the word count goal at the bottom right hand corner. Writer&#39;s block is the only barrier, and since there&#39;s no expectation of publication it doesn&#39;t even have to come out precisely right. Just keep typing until you are done with filling up the box.
</p>
<p>
I started to try to write an index to Vacuum as an exercise in organization, and what I found was that the tools I have for rereading the that text are too weak. What I really want to do is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/back_up.html" target="_self">download the whole stinking mess</a> and put it into some kind of file system that I can grep through. What words did I use, and when? Have I usefully repeated myself? Is there some clever phrase that gets used too much? All of that is easy enough to construct with the right text analysis environment, but very hard with just Google&#39;s searching tools at my disposal.
</p>
<p>
Organizing a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a>, especially an exceptionally varied one, is very hard work. I have a shelf full of paper notebooks dating back to the 1990s with words in them that perhaps deserve to be unearthed and reanimated for the net, but it&#39;s so hard to know without a very laborious process of reading through them one page at a time, puzzling out the inscriptions and deciding which would have been better forgotten. I know there&#39;s interesting work there mixed in with the sketches and the odd lists of people to call.</p>
<p>Twenty words to go.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, <a href="http://750words.com" target="_self">750 words</a> is a system which encourages you to write 750 words of disposable throwaway prose every day. If it turns out that you can reuse some of it, so much the better! I think this essay might have about 400 useful words in it, and I&#39;ll try to pull them out for Vacuum.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I ended up throwing away two whole paragraphs from the original edit of this essay, so the word count is only about 650. The time to edit the whole thing was almost as long as the time to write it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>750 words on blogging, memory and forgetting</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently.</p>
<p>With over 2,000 posts in this Typepad installation I started to try to do an index. My writing here was ranged from recipes for semolina pudding to weather maps of Australia to accounts of a peanut processing plant in Texas. No single index is going to make any sense for all of that.</p>
<p>Even though I&#39;ve read a lot, and written a lot, I&#39;ve most likely forgetten most of what I&#39;ve ever written down. The temporary focus on a temporary enthusiasm carries through for a while and then gets discarded, saved but not readily at hand. After years of cumulative writing, what&#39;s there is not a single coherent whole ready to be sculpted into a neat linear narrative, but instead the sometimes interesting and sometimes fragmentary open notebook of a life lived near the keyboard.</p>
<p>Does writing help the memory? Certainly by writing things down you can cause them to be pinned down into a single tangible format that can be referred to later, and if you refer back to them often enough the transient interest becomes something concrete. There&#39;s a lot to be said for putting words down on paper so that they can be edited and refined so that there&#39;s something very particular that they say.</p>
<p>What is our memory these days? With the ubiquity of the Google and its all-seeing maw fed with the writings of our time, the strategy to memorize something may simply be to write it down in a place where it can be Googled and then search to refer back to it when it&#39;s needed.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Google’s maw is infinite and it will undoubtedly attempt someday to put every book ever written in every language into its digital coffers. - <a href="http://warrenadler.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-to-rescue.html" target="_self">Warren Adler</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeding Google is hardly a part-time task, and I feel a need to feed Twitter which is equally hungry to capture the short form version of contemporary accounts of our existence. Twitter is threatening to disgorge for our own personal use the collected record of our Twitter stream - every sandwich you ever ate, every time you complained about squeaky brakes on the bus, every poorly edited grumpy text mashed into the input box - and somehow certainly that will enter our personal memory space as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Forgetting is as important as remembering&quot; - <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/vacuum-0.html" target="_self">Brian Eno</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process of accumulating digital reminders of what we once experienced is occasionally punctuated by digital loss. There&#39;s the sudden catastrophic loss of the online system that dies with your words left stranded on it, or the hard drive that craters before all of the backups are done. There&#39;s also the slow loss of unfindability where the words or pictures still are somewhere, but you&#39;ve forgotten the magic incantation that will bring them onto the screen. I&#39;ve stranded some text of my own creation, hidden in the grand archives of the University, inaccessible to me or to anyone else because they are student records and thus off limits because of FERPA. No matter, I have remembered a few of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pop tarts and auto parts. - Michael Joyce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every once in a long time, the words that you wrote long ago resurface. I wrote to Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 asking about home page design, and our correspondence was recently <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/home-page-design-advice-from-october-1991-3-months-after-the-webs-public-debut/266380/" target="_self">quoted in The Atlantic online.</a>&#0160;Aside from proving that I was there way back when, it reminded me that finding things online is an ongoing struggle, and that our puny screens and keyboards routinely fail us when looking for the answer to a complicated problem or to give us access to what we know is not very far away. The particular question was on home page design, and I know little more about it now than I did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>By writing I remember, and I throw a few more words into the big soup that try to draw on from time to time to recall what I am and what I know. I&#39;ve forgetten more than I&#39;ve ever remembered, and it&#39;s good to go rummaging through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a> to see what can be unearthed.</p>

  <h3>27 December 2012</h3>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-27-ubiquity-focus-and-isolation-as-success-factors-for-internet-socialiability/">Ubiquity, focus, and isolation as success factors for Internet socialiability</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private <a class="zem_slink" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people.</p>
<p>In addition to ubiquity and focus, I&#39;d like to suggest a third axis of utility for social media - &quot;isolation&quot;. It&#39;s the notion that you can go somewhere online and do something special that&#39;s unlike anything else on the net, and that because of this the rules that have accreted over time about expected behavior are different.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[2]" />As an example, I have an account on <a class="zem_slink" href="http://pinterest.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Pinterest">Pinterest</a> that I use nearly exclusively for collecting maps. I don&#39;t follow all of my friends there, and I don&#39;t expect that people will follow me just because they are my friends. Similarly, a few friends have Plurk accounts in a little circle where no one expects that anyone else will read what they write and where there is a decided element of silliness that would not play on Facebook.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[5]" />I think we all need a little corner of the net to call our own. Facebook ranks very low on the isolation scale and so it will not appeal to those who are looking for a quiet corner to express themselves. A lightly trafficked wiki, your own blog, or the carefully walled off corner of an interest-specific forum can all have that isolation factor that lets us be sociable but not to the entire world all at once.</p>

Part of the news that gets circulated is information about power outages, in the form of calls for linemen to work at utility companies. In the current storm (&quot;Euclid&quot; as the Weather Channel dubs it) one item has a litany of places that people are either heading to or working from. Happily, they linked to my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage map collection</a> and I&#39;m getting some hits from that.</p>

      <p>I'm struggling with the single user nature of this Android tablet. </p>

<p>My kids are complaining that they don't want all of the interruptions and notifications from the apps that I have installed. Frankly I agree with them, a Facebook window just popped up when I was writing this. </p>

<p>It would be easier if the front unlock screen was a real login screen.</p>

<p>The boys got D2 pads (<a href="http://d2pad.info" target="_self"><a href="http://d2pad.info">http://d2pad.info</a></a>) for Hanukah. Here&rsquo;s a 250 word long review of this 7&rdquo; Android tablet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&rsquo;t have much to compare against. The experience so far recommends it as a handy adjunct to a full-size computer for some tasks, and it makes me more confident in my hunch that an Android phone is going to be my next phone.</p>
<p>We ran into problems charging one of the devices, but helpful tech support fixed it. The D2 pad would not charge with the provided wall adapter, but it did charge just fine using a USB cable. I can&rsquo;t explain why.</p>
<p>The devices don&rsquo;t support the Google Play store. I find myself mostly using the Amazon App Store, which appears to be a credible alternative. I&rsquo;m sticking to free apps for the moment; the favorite so far is Swype, an alternative keyboard.</p>
<p>The camera on the device grainy even in good light, and it takes crappy photos in low light. It would be fine for a low resolution video chat.</p>
<p>The touch screen is surprisingly good for such an inexpensive device. On one of the two units, we found that there was a small defect where it appeared that one corner of the screen was being pressed down on continuously; that seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>I wish the device allowed true multiple user operations. #2 son is getting tired of having my Google calendar alerts show up on his screen.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>One of the pads now has a cracked screen, after someone got a bit frustrated with it. It still functions just fine. The funky defect on the corner of the screen never really did go away.</p>
<p>The Android operating system environment gets an enthusiastic thumbs up from the more vigorous user of the system, who is looking forward to the day when he gets better hardware to work with. He&rsquo;s showed me all sorts of fun things including an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ytremote" target="_self">Android based remote control for Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The boys are getting used to seeing Papa&rsquo;s Twitter show up from time to time on their screens, and #1 son is looking forward to the day when he&rsquo;s old enough to get his own Twitter account.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.</p>
<p>The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.</p>
<p>Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. The Canton District Library does have an installation of LibraryThing for Libraries, their OPAC integration product, which lets you check availability of a book straight from LibraryThing. The lack of a direct link means that to find a book in the AADL that I have on my screen in LibraryThing I have to click a few more times. I suppose that&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to tag and categorize books that you don&#39;t own yourself, but only have collected them from the library? There was a time when I tagged things everywhere I found them - photos on Flickr, web sites on Delicious - but these days that doesn&#39;t seem so important. I like seeing other people&#39;s tags, especially for works that are unfamiliar, but it hardly seems essential to do it for my own use unless there&#39;s some list I&#39;m trying to put together. When did tagging cease being fun?</p>
<p>I&#39;m spending some of my time on the site deleting books that I no longer even remember having read or that I no longer wish to remember. That should result in better recommendations, and maybe a chance to reread something that would have been worth remembering. My use of the site peaked in 2008 so there&#39;s not as much recent coverage as I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>The recommendations from LibraryThing are really quite good, and they are even better for reflecting which of the books you&#39;ve already read. The site generates ten recommendations based on other people&#39;s reading patterns, and it reminds you that you&#39;ve read some of the ones on that list with a checkmark.</p>
<p>I wish I read more books and fewer web pages.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. </p>
<p>I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way.</p>
<p>I weary of scanning the net looking for the next space to insert a little bit of pithy commentary. Write long to find some free space to wander around in and write on and then edit before it is launched out into the world. If there are pithy bits buried inside, so much the better - but the goal is not to string together a sequence of quips and quotes but instead to explore a possibility space and bump up against some creative edges.</p>
<p>Writing long is a contemplative activity. Sort through the main theme and find other related ideas to explore. A short paragraph invites adding an extra sentence in the middle to clarify, expound, or to share some added insight. Allow space to type in to allow for some wandering through the world of ideas without necessarily having to come&#0160;to the point right away.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the wandering in your own thought-space that is appealing, even if you decide for the sake of the reader that you need to eventually trim a paragraph that doesn&#39;t fit. Write that extra paragraph in order to get to the good paragraph that awaits after it&#39;s been written. Write some extra words so that your inner editor has something to improve at the end of the effort. Adding in more words lets you explore a variety of turns of a phrase, and the slow process of selecting from multiple alternatives may suggest additional lines of reasoning. &#0160;Surplus words are there for a purpose, even though their purpose may only be to be removed.</p>
<p>The careful slow process of editing works better when there&#39;s a lot to start from. It&#39;s not enough to have the right words; they have to be in the right order. Collecting lots of words give you a chance to sift through them with a clear eye after the original collection is made, and pull out the better ones and leave some others for a later time. In the process of doing this, you might end up rewriting the same phrase multiple times. Keep trying until the suitable phrase emerges, and then collect up the debris that remains around it to see if there&#39;s one more thing you wanted to say.</p>
<p>Editing is a process of adding or deleting words to meet a set of constraints. If you have too many words in a sentence, too many sentences in a paragraph, or too many paragraphs on the page, the constraint leads you to omit needless words. If the page is empty and you have a goal to fill it up, the need is to expand, augment, and add to the words on the page - even if you have some eventual hope of hitting a word limit which will motivate you to trim back the extra verbiage. Once you have hit your word count, there&#39;s a balance point where every extra word demands that another word be removed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been ruminating over the phrase &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, which stems from Stuart Kauffman who useds it to think about the world of evolutionary biology. The world builds on what it has, and the more aware we are of all of the possibilities in our world the more adjacent opportunities can present themselves. From the perspective of writing, the adjacent possible word is every word that could be added or subtracted from a partially finished work to make it better.&#0160;</p>
<p>This lends itself to thinking about writing via the adjacent possible. Get some words out on the page, and then use that as your raw materials to remix, rework, or rearrange until you have something better than the original. In your first draft, don&#39;t obsess about getting every sentence perfect. Use the initial writing effort as a chance to explorate some phrases and to try out a few unfamiliar terms of art. Write some extra words, so that you can delete them later.&#0160;</p>
<p>If I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you a thousand times: repetition is the very soul of the net. If you have a good idea, why say it only once? Repeat it over and over again in different guises until your reader is thoroughly struck through with the notion. Say it, change a word, and say it once again. Delete words to make room for others that are better.</p>
<p>The slow process of accumulating words takes time. If you are fortunate, you start out with a set of ideas that allows for exploration of a variety of perspectives and alternatives, and a structure that gives you some guidance for what comes first and what happens next. Even a mechanical exploration of that possibility space can generate the necessary length of a first draft that works to reach the distance, with a few extra words to spare that can be trimmed later. Keep writing until you discover what it is that you should have been focusing on from the first, so that you can go back later and carve out the good parts for more prominent display.</p>
<p>At some point, the page is full, and it&#39;s time to bring the exploration to an end. You have more than your fair allotment of words, and it&#39;s time to cut, not add. The extra words that you drop out are scaffolding, the extra space that you built in order to find the permanent space that you really wanted. Even if the total is over what you had originally planned to write, count on the process of addition by subtraction and carve out the good words from the big pile that you have built.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means.</p>
<p>The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that.</p>
<p>What I think it might mean is working with my todo list - <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">which is currently in a github issue tracker</a> - and approaching it in an associative fashion rather than going strictly linearly through it. The goal is to make progress on a variety of things, but not necessarily to work down one long deterministic ordered list. I&#39;ve organized my github list so that pretty much everything has a tag or two, and thus I can turn a 100-long list into a 10-long list and crunch through it without it feeling infinite.</p>
<p>
Ideally you find yourself in a situation where there are a few easy things that have been languishing for a while that right now you just know that you can do, so you get up from your computer and you do them. This works especially well when you&#39;ve salted away some easy, but not for now tasks into the list so that they can get done at some impromptu opportune moment.</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that this approach to self-tasking is related to the concept of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/04/marginally_usef.html" target="_self">structured procrastination</a>. My 2005 self had the idea that it was good to write things down that you weren&#39;t ready to do just yet, so that you could randomly (!) generate suggestions that would be productive when you had some down time that you weren&#39;t ready to focus on the big things.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&#39;s trip.</p>
<p>I asked Cindy DePetro from MAHS about the calendar and the responses they&#39;ve gotten from it. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to get praised over the quality of the photos, but our biggest praise is that most people feel like they receive a little piece of home when they see our calendars. We get many repeat customers, and our calendars travel all over the world. Thus far, we know they are being sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany and China.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while I try to organize my life. Usually the effort is temporary, with one system working really well as I download all of my tasks out of my inbox and into it, and then slowly languishing until it fails for some mysterious reason to actually get me to do things more efficiently.</p>
<p>You only need to look at my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/productivity/" target="_self">productivity</a> category here to marvel at how ideas come and go.</p>
<p>The latest approach to this, with a test time of all of three days before I write about how wonderful it is, is to use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_self">github</a> as an issue tracker. Now it helps that I&#39;m also using github as an issue tracker for a couple of other projects, so it&#39;s not a big learning curve, and the more familiar I get with the tool the better off I suspect I&#39;ll be.</p>
<p>Issues in github look more or less like items in a conferencing system that has single threaded conversations. The title of the issue is the most searchable part of it, so it pays to have good titles. Each issue can refer to other issues by number (e.g. #4) so you don&#39;t have to worry that renaming an issue forces you to update links. Issues can be in exactly one milestone, and milestones have due dates which you are reminded about. Issues also have one or more categories and the categories are color coded.</p>
<p>I&#39;m approaching this along the lines that the traditional &quot;inbox zero&quot; or &quot;get things done&quot; approach wants to have it work - your inboxes, all of them, stay as empty as they can all of the time, and the big long issue tracker list is the semi-infinite comprehensive list of everything there is to do. You work your way through that list using some subset of it to prompt activity, and you tick off tasks as completed when they&#39;re eventually done. Anything that comes into an empty inbox gets dispatched promptly so that the inbox stays empty, but you don&#39;t and can&#39;t do everything on your todo list at once.</p>
<p>So far so good? The cost is non-zero, which means that if I decide to give up on this I have the motivating force of a few dollars a month to either prod me into action or use as a budget for some other tool. At worst I get better at using github for a while.</p>

      <p><p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.</p>
<p>The examples that come to mind share some common traits.</p>
<ol>
<li>there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other</li>
<li>for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least.</li>
<li>the successful communicator is good at more than one network and can move between them, pulling ideas and people along for the ride.</li>
<li>somewhere at the center of the network there&#39;s a culturally appropriate publication process that generates an external memory of what has been communicated, whether that&#39;s a ritual behavior, a database, something like a wiki, or some book or printed artifact.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that if you can manage to satisfy all four of these factors that you can get alongwith a wide range of technologies. The working amateur radio clubs that I know fit the bill,&#0160;as do some networks that are coordinated by prolific bloggers or that have sprung up&#0160;around civic wikis.</p>
<p>The thing that emerged from writing this was realizing that ritual behavior could be the&#0160;external memory that you get from community leadership, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily&#0160;need to be written down. Just knowing that there&#39;s some component of a community that&#0160;gathers in an orderly way regularly and that follows a pattern that&#39;s not much different&#0160;from the time before, that&#39;s a powerful synchronizing pulse that can feed all sorts of&#0160;other informal collaboration.</p>
Thanks to Kevin Doyle Jones for the conversation that led to this.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I just got done reading Francis Spufford&#39;s &quot;Red Plenty&quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.</p>
<p>Some other reviews of the work, so that I don&#39;t miss them:</p>
<p>Jo Walton: <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/the-glorious-terrible-strange-ussr-francis-spuffords-red-plenty" target="_self">The Glorious, Terrible, Strange USSR: Francis Spufford’s&#0160;<em>Red Plenty</em></a></p>
<p><em>It’s not SF. It’s not really&#0160;<em>fiction</em>, though it’s not non-fiction either. It’s something strangely between the two, a fictionalised non-fiction book about the Soviet Dream. Reading it partakes of some of the pleasures of reading especially geeky SF, and some of the pleasure of reading solid well-written nonfiction on a fascinating subject. It’s about history, economics, how technology and ideology interact, and how theory and practice are different, with examples. What it’s most like is reading an extended version of one of Neal Stephenson’s more adorable infodumps, only with footnotes and a proper end.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>Crooked Timber put together a <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RedPlenty.pdf" target="_self">Red Plenty reader</a> with about a dozen essays.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2010/08/red_plenty_by_f.shtml" target="_self">Adam Roberts writes in Strange Horizons</a>, a science fiction review:</p>
<p><em>To take the first first. When people talk about &quot;science fiction&quot; the science they are thinking of (as it might be) physics, or chemistry, or perhaps biology. But that&#39;s a narrow way of taking things. The science in&#0160;<cite>Red Plenty</cite>&#0160;is economics, and reading the book will teach you a tremendous amount about the logic (and illogic) of running a planned economy on the Soviet scale. The speculative portion of the science here is the striking attempt by Vitalevich and Nemchinov to modify the catastrophically inflexible Soviet economic model with a mechanism—&quot;shadow prices&quot;—better able to match supply to demand without simply instituting Capitalist &quot;free&quot; markets. Perhaps it sounds dry, but I found it fascinating, and precisely as science-fictional as a proposed new spaceship drive or cloning technology.</em></p>

      <p>See <a href="http://www.toledowiki.net" target="_self">toledowiki.net</a>&#0160;for a city wiki for Toledo, Ohio. As of this writing it has 113 users, who have created 362 pages about the city.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Coffee_Shops" target="_self">coffee shops</a> that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Flyers" target="_self">flyers</a> collection lets you see what&#39;s on the bulletin boards around town.</p>
<p>My working knowledge of Toledo is bounded by the few places that I routinely visit - the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Museum_of_Art" target="_self">art museum</a>, the ball field where the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Mud_Hens" target="_self">Mud Hens</a> play, and a few routine stops along the freeway near the turnpike exit. It&#39;s incredibly helpful to have a local guide to the whole rest of the town to make it possible to think about alternative destinations the next time I visit.</p>

A suggestion was Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of<br />measurement, mathematics, and librarianship, known for her&#0160;seven-pointed headdress and leopardskin dress.<br /><br />&lt;<a href="http://www.egyptianmyths.net/seshat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.egyptianmyths.net/seshat.htm</a>&gt;<br />&quot;Seshat carried many titles, such as &quot;Lady of Builders&quot;, &quot;Mistress of&#0160;the House of Books&quot;, and &quot;Foremost in the Library&quot;.&quot;<br />&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seshat.svg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seshat.svg</a>&gt;<br /><br />Also mentioned was a recommendation for the book, &quot;War of Art.&quot;<br />&lt;<a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/" target="_blank">http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/</a>&gt;<br /><br />Main question focused on upcoming events, where to have events, and&#0160;&quot;December-y-type stuff&quot;.<br /><br />Upcoming Events:<br /><br />- Ed&#39;s birthday (see y&#39;all next week!)<br />- Kiwanis sale Fri-Sat 9-12<br />- Workantile makers fest - January; Show and tell for makers<br />- Xmas movies at Michigan Theater free on ...

      <p>My friend Dan <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/" target="_self">KB6NU</a>&#0160;was network control for the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umarc/net/net.html" target="_self">W8UM net</a> tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern&#0160;(145.230 MHz, -600 kHz shift, 100 Hz PL). This was my first try at being on for the net, and so I waited patiently until my radio started making noises other than static.</p>
<p>After most everyone else checked in, I hit the transmit button and gave my call sign (KD8OQG) and was acknowledged by Dan.&#0160;</p>
<p>Among other things discussed tonight:</p>
<p>The Amateur Radio Relay League&#39;s <a href="http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world" target="_self">Logbook of the World</a>;<br />Where to get amateur radio gear in Hawaii, for someone traveling there;<br />The Monday, November 19 2012 performance of the <a href="http://www.music.umich.edu/special_programs/youth/mye/MYEsymphonyorch.htm" target="_self">Michigan Youth Symphony Orchestra</a> at Hill Auditorium.&#0160;</p>
<p>I mostly listened, but it was an enjoyable hour spent, and it&#39;s always good to tune in to a good discussion.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The new Consumers Energy Power Outage map is at&#0160;<a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap" target="_self">http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap</a>. Here&#39;s a map with the service territory marked - there are no outages to speak of on the map right now. The page automatically switches to a mobile web view if you are coming from a smart mobile device (IOS and Android; not so much Blackberry). There are three views: one for individual detailed outages, one at a city level, and one at a county level. According to the webinar I&#39;m listening to now, the detailed outages are running in real time, and the city/county overview is delayed up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>For the media, this augments but does not replace the existing direct contacts to Consumers Energy public relations representatives who can answer questions.</p>
<p>For storms in Michigan that come from west to east, it will be useful to watch to see how badly the storm affects Consumers before it gets to Detroit Edison territory.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards.</p>
<p>I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month.
</p>

<p><blockquote>I am responding to your request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act received November 6, 2012 for a copy of monthly logs of confiscated signs for 2012. Your request is granted.  The number of confiscated signs for the 2012 year to date is 285.  The number if signs collected each month of this year is as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>January - 37 <br />February - 41 <br />March - 23 <br />April - 55 <br />May - 65 <br />June - 82 <br />July - 63 <br />August - 114 <br />September - 34 <br />October - 206 <br />November to date - 105</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s certainly a followup request that tries to go deeper into detail for each of these sign confiscations, but what I thought was interesting was the definite connection between the political season and the number of signs taken down.</p></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wcbn.org" target="_self">WCBN</a> is an amazing student-run radio station at the University of Michigan, founded in 1972 and broadcasting from the basement of the Student Activities Building. Listen live to WCBN at 88.3 FM (all the way to the left on your dial) or <a href="http://www.wcbn.org/listen.html" target="_self">online</a>. You might need to go online to enjoy it if you live outside the transmission area - this map from the FCC shows an approximate radius of where the station can best be enjoyed, though I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve heard it from further away.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll all be glad that the detours that made our west side neighbors seem like they were far, far away will be gone, and as an added surprise bonus the bridge will be ready for the final football game vs. Iowa.</p>
