<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<blockquote>
FERGUSON • An uneasy peace has again settled over the Ferguson apartment complex where a recent Normandy High School graduate was shot dead Saturday afternoon by a Ferguson police officer.

Tensions had flared briefly as darkness settled over the shooting site on Canfield Drive.

But the scene is again calm, according to eyewitnesses.

      </h3>
      <p>The 6 year run of the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> is coming to a close. The end date will be Septmeber 2, 2014, which happens to be an Ann Arbor City Council night as well.</p>

<p>The Chronicle was noted for its relentless and exhausting coverage of civic meetings. You could get the feeling that you too had sat on the hard benches for hours as you read through a 15,000 word account of what transpired. Hey, you could even read 6,000 words from time to time about meetings that never got a quorum.</p>

<p>I'll miss the Chronicle, which was one beacon of honest (if quirky) journalism in a town that hasn't always had a newspaper that I've looked forward to reading. It will become just a little harder to keep up with municipal government, and more people in government will get a free pass because they don't have a critical eye focused on what they do. I completely understand that six years of two people's lives is a lot to give for the cause of local journalism, and I wish Dave and Mary the best.</p>

<blockquote>
Note: The annual Bezonki award festivities will still take place – on Friday, Aug. 15  – and you’re invited. The open house will run from 6-8 p.m. at Zingerman’s Events on Fourth in Kerrytown. There will be teeter-tottering and general merriment. Publisher Mary Morgan will follow up with a final word on Sept. 2, after the city council meeting ends. That will be our final report filed from the hard benches of city hall.

      </h3>
      <p>Avoid the long lines and sit down quickly with these tips at Zingerman's Deli.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the bread counter in the deli. After you taste the samples, get a bagel. Ask them to slice it. (Or ask for one of their yummy bialys which I did last time I was there.)</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to the deli counter or the fish counter, if you're hungry for same. Ask for something you'd like to put on that bagel.</p></li>
<li><p>Go ahead to the head of the line! You don't need to wait for the long lines at the sandwich ordering counter. If you want something to drink, you can get it at checkout. Assemble the sandwich yourself when you get to your seat.</p></li>
<li><p>Interested in a more substantial sandwich? You can get premade sandwiches that are delicious (but smaller than the big Zingerman's sandwiches) at Zingerman's Next Door.</p></li>
<li><p>Call ahead! You can phone in your order ahead of time and have it ready when you get there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's not really a secret menu, but it does let you walk in, grab something delicious, and go sit down and take in the scene. It also lets you get through the line in only a few minutes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This map from <a href="http://lightningmaps.org">LightningMaps.ORG</a> shows lightning over Lake Michigan and into Ottawa County, Michigan at about 11:15 p.m on 22 July 2014. Note the strong line of storms crossing the lake.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a511e73a00970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a511e73a00970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Lightning-map-22-july-2014-2321-est" title="Lightning-map-22-july-2014-2321-est" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a511e73a00970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The corresponding power outage map is from <a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap">Consumers Energy</a>. Outage reporting generally lags behind realtime by 15-30 minutes, and of course not every lightning strike turns into a power problem (though sometimes it seems like it does).</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>ANN ARBOR, July 1, 2014: The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission is considering the Glendale Condominiums, a proposed development at 312 Glendale Place. Neighbors came out in force to oppose the development, citing among other things the impact that the proposed new impervious surface would exacerbate the existing flooding events that have affected the nearby neighborhoods. The developer has proposed an above ground storm water retention system, using a pond to capture the runoff and retain water on site so that the water from the parking lots doesn't rush into neighbor basements.</p>

<p>A number of homeowners downstream from the development are already using sump pumps to keep their basements dry. Having a sump pump running in your basement continuously for hours or even days is not something that homeowners look forward to managing. Since the water flow through the entire system (Allen Creek) can make its way into basements anywhere downstream, the residents from the whole watershed have an interest in the issue.</p>

<p>The internet of sump pumps, if it were to exist, would give some overall understanding for city planners and water resources managers. It would let you know not only whether your sump pump is running, but also whether your neighbors pumps are running, and maybe also the total flows and total energy consumed by the pumping systems. If it existed - and it doesn't yet, not to my knowledge - we could make decisions about developments like this based on actual stormwater data and not anecdotes and stories.</p>

<p>There have been a number of attempts made by individual homeowners around the world to control their sump pumps or monitor their sump pumps with the current set of small internet devices like the Raspberry Pi. Expensive industrial pumps come with network interfaces like MODBUS that offer site managers control and integration into SCADA systems. To make this work you need level sensors, controllable pumps, moisture sensors, and other sensor and control infrastructure just to make the system work. Beyond that, you'd want remote monitoring of the various sensor so that you could tell whether it's working or not and also generate pretty graphs and reports and urgent pages to your favorite plumber to bring the system back online if it fails.</p>

<p>The internet of sump pumps is in its infancy. You'll find home made systems like Greg's Sump Pump, aka Sumpy McPumperton, which tweets out its current status. You'll also find top-of-the-line systems with built-in hardwired internet connections and some kind of artificial intelligence. (Sumpy is pretty smart, though.)</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-27-the-internet-of-power-outages/">The internet of power outages</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The single most popular page on this web site is the power outage tracking map collection page. It has static copies of samples of power outage maps from utilities around the country, and it gets bunches of hits every single time there's bad weather - to the extent that I can pretty much tell where there's bad weather by the outbound clicks on the page.</p>

<p>The page, however, is not fed with live data; it only has static instances of previous maps. It in and of itself doesn't alert when there's trouble, and it doesn't let you know that the storm coming your way might be severe.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of automation in the utility outage map space is the diversity of vendors for power company outage maps and the utter lack of any standard interface. To dig out how many people have lost their power in 48104 under program control, you actually have to work at it, and to rely on undocumented interfaces that could change at any time. For all of the user-friendly efforts out there, there's a lot of systems that are hard to pull raw data from.</p>

<p>I've started a very tiny version of what I suspect could be a complete project, namely to automate the alerting when a few zip codes around me have outages. The code, written in Node-RED, runs periodically to poll the DTE Energy outage map site and to ask for outage data for a few specific zip codes. It then parses that data in a Javascript/node.js node which returns it to a switch that decides whether to alert (in my case, when there are more than 250 outages in any given monitored zipcode). Alerts go out via Twitter on the @vielmetti account and via SMS to me.</p>

<p>The monitoring task for the adjacent utility company, Consumers Energy, is a bit different. I haven't completed this effort yet, but again a poll of their site will pull a report which in this case has a list of counties and an outage count in each county. There's a few counties that I'm monitoring, and I'll figure out the threshold for alerts there.</p>

<p>Node-RED is a nice programming environment for this, since it's flexible in many ways about how data gets into it and how and when alerts are done. I'm still sorting through the new "trigger" alert node in 0.8.0 which makes it possible to buffer up things so you don't get an overflow of messages all at once, and there's some subtle alarm-management logic that I want to get right so that this system can be used for real alerting and not just curiosity.</p>

<p>When Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast, there was a long delay between the time that power went out and when it was restored, and there was some innovation in outage tracking and holding public utilities accountable for restoration performance. Similarly, when a storm hit the East Lansing, MI area there were furious municipal power consumers outraged that their utility company didn't have an accurate tracking map.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this starts to look like an architecture for outage tracking that can be refined over time, and I'd be super happy if utility companies started to post outage information in any reasonable easy to parse JSON or XML format files (really, it just has to be published, standards can occur as we get experience). I'll poll regularly enough to get some kind of timeline as to when the lights went out and how long it took for them to return.</p>

<p>I have found myself thinking about things, and how to connect things to the net, quite a bit recently. I'll be blogging more about it here and elsewhere.</p>

<p>By "things" I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can't connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do. In the middle of this network there are message routing systems, and at the human edge there are various points where people need to make decisions about what should happen next.</p>

<p>Things are fascinating in many places that the web is not. Treating web site visitors like so many pinballs through a funnel dehumanizes them, but that's a lot of what makes people focus on user behavior. </p>

<p>I've been building things out of smaller things, learning how to plumb them together, understanding message flows and designing out behaviors. It's transformative in the way that making web pages never will be transformative.  The task now is to write some of this stuff up, the late night experiments and the discovery of new hardware and the task of plugging things together and making them work. </p>

It's a hacker space in a basement on E Liberty St in downtown Ann Arbor (at Maynard Street), where Dawn Treader was once upon a time and later Digital Ops.</p>

<p>I decided a few weeks ago to become a member, so that I'd have a workshop that was well stocked with equipment and so that I could start working on projects in a place that not only had cool stuff but also that had smart people and was convenient to downtown.</p>

<p>What's the project for summer 2014? Certainly a piece of it is getting a new Raspberry Pi hooked up and running and getting some blinking lights attached to it. The next order of business past that is unclear. I'm interested in short-haul digital radios for remote monitoring and control systems, and there are some Arduino based kits (the <a href="http://moderndevice.com/product/jeenode-smd/">Jeenode</a>, for instance) that look like they would be useful for radio-based efforts. </p>

<p>At some point I'll want to learn how to solder, if only because there's some things you can only build when you know how to do more than plug cables together!</p>

<p>What do you do with the Internet of Cats? You have a cat with a collar, and some number of grams of electronics that can be affixed to the collar. What kind of interesting internet stuff can go there?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was productive this morning, cranking out about 1500 words in the span of a couple of hours without much in the way of distractions. It was a timely day to be productive, and the morning's activity resulted in a further productive afternoon meeting. It was a good day. (Not every day is always a good day for writing.)</p>

<p>How do I get away from distractions? The key was to find an unusual place in this world: a location with good enough coffee, enough power outlets, broken wifi and no cell service. (It was the Scio Township Panera, if you're wondering.) The lack of T-Mobile service, and the downtime on the Panera wifi, meant that I could easily ignore the dozens of email messages that I might answer and the infinite stream of things to read online and instead open up a terminal window, open up vim, and start typing until the screen filled up and then some.</p>

<p>The problem with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/the-problem-with-unreliablenetworks-is-that-you-have-to-engineer-extra-hard-to-be-able-to-make-use-of-them-and-you-still-ca.html">unreliable networks</a> is that you have to work extra hard to get any value out of them, enough to distract you entirely from their use. When the Internet is completely down, though, it's much easier. I have good enough writing tools to create prose without an Internet necessary for looking things up, and the notes I was working from were all on paper. Any research I needed to do during the course of the writing got marked with an XXX, and when the Panera wifi came back online, I was able to fill in a few gaps.</p>

<p>It takes either a little bit of good luck or a great deal of self discipline to go off the net. Modern computing systems assume that always-on is the normal case, and that offline behavior is anomalous. Indeed there are systems like the Chromebook that are completely crippled without a network there to make them happy, but no one I know sells a laptop that doesn't have wifi built in.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Did you ever wake up from a long session online and discover that you had very little to show for it? </p>

<p>There's a pattern of internet use that's simple and very disturbingly unproductive. Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn't produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you've visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there's something new.</p>

<p>It's a wonderful way to consume content, and since you're always looking at new things it's a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty. Subscribe to enough people, join enough networks, and you could fill your hours with new things indefinitely.</p>

<p>What this doesn't provide you with is a chance to create your own thing. Sure, you can share, retweet, bookmark, comment, or favorite, but that's not the same as picking an idea that's fresh and spending a few minutes from scratch presenting something new - not just new to you, but new to the world.</p>

<p>Creating something from nothing is much more difficult work than reading or looking what what other people have done. It takes time, and more importantly it forces you to risk making something that other people will judge. I heartily recommend getting off the social network refresh treadmill from time to time and writing something longer, even if it's not perfect.</p>

  <p>One of our key values at Buffer is to work smarter, not harder. Personal improvement is a big part of that, so giving employees a tool that can help improve their sleep patterns is a no-brainer.</p>
  
  <p>A few weeks in it's already had an incredible effect. Browsing everyone's sleep patterns and talking about how to get more deep sleep has an amazing effect on productivity.</p>

<p>It's good when companies give off a clear "this is not for me" signal.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here's a latest try.</p>

<p>There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban:
1. Visualize your work
2. Limit your work-in-progress</p>

<p>I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/personal-kanban-from-jim-benson-and-modus-cooperandi.html">wrote about Personal Kanban before</a> back in 2010, but I didn't try to put it into practice as such.</p>

<p>Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There's a <a href="http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/boardthing/">review of Boardthing</a> from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it's a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board. The little rectangles each have some text or an image in them, and they can be nested so you can move them around in groups. There's really not much more than that, and it runs in a browser.</p>

<p>This infrastructure is enough to create a Personal Kanban board. Create little rectangles at minimum for "Things to do", "Doing", and "Done", and type into the little rectangles to move them around until you figure out what to do, stop typing, and get something done. I recommend a "Things not to do" rectangle as an added productivity boost.</p>

<p>How does this work in the long term? The system is pretty light weight, and it saves your state between sessions. I suppose if your page gets too cluttered you can start a new one that is more focused. Having a smallish screen forces you to limit your work in progress, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave Gray and Jim Benson have a set of approaches that should work well together, this is mostly written for the both of them as an introduction of sorts.</p>
