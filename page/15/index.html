<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The weekly a2b3 lunch met at Madras Masala on this the third Thursday of March. It's been our habit to meet at Madras on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays. The dining room is large and could seat a large party, but our typical lunch has rarely less than 6 and rarely more than 8 people there, which is just about perfect.</p>

<p>This week's tally was 6, which is just barely big enough to justify a formal round of introductions, but we did it anyway. The discussion, minus the introductions, ranged widely from the workings of lathes to the scene at Community High School to the everyday objects that we carry with us each day. I won't even try to summarize, there was just so much to say that we talked non-stop for 90 minutes and were still chatting at the end.</p>

<p>As always the food at Madras was good, and just spicy enough that some people who had been regulars aren't likely to come because the diet does not agree with them. To this end we are planning a west side visit to Chela's on March 27, 2014. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/events/168490202/">See the details on Meetup</a>, and hope to see you there.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang'an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online.</p>

<p>Notes from a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/finn-brunton-the-accidental-archive-notes-on-a-talk-monday-january-28-2013.html">2013 talk by Finn Brunton on The Accidental Archive</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Notes from the talk follow here. I kept a running log with Twitter, and I'm writing this from my Pinboard <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:bitcoin">bitcoin bookmarks</a>; these links are to the bookmarks for ease of linking for the most park. I'm not trying to reconstruct the talk, just to give context for my bookmarks!</p>

<p>The talk started off with a discussion of the Audrey Hepburn film <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:charade">Charade</a>, in which the mystery of what happened to the wealth of a family is only resolved when it's realized that rather than searching for lost money that they should be trying to make sense of the tail of rare stamps. This was the kickoff to an extended and wide-ranging discussion of the various roles and purposes of money throughout history and how very odd things that don't look like currency at all still functioned as stores of value, units of account, or mediums of exchange.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has peculiar mathematical properties that make it unusually suited for use as a store of value. Bitcoins are mined through a process that's NP-hard, which means for practical purposes that it's difficult to create them but easy to prove that they are real. Bitcoin is a "proof of work"; someone did something hard, consuming scarce computing power and copious amounts of energy, in order to accomplish a task that's easy to confirm. </p>

<p>Finn talked about other coin systems (usually lumped under the term "altcoin") that are based on Bitcoin but that are run separately and have their own twists. There's <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:allahcoin">Allahcoin</a>, which donates a percentage of each transaction to the Muslim Brotherhood; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:aphroditecoin">Aphroditecoin</a>, which is doing an "air drop" to give citizens of Cyprus their own money; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:mazacoin">Mazacoin</a>, from the Oglala Lakota Nation; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:freicoin">Freicoin</a>, which depreciates through "demurrage" if you don't spend it; and most notably <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin">Dogecoin</a>, a joke of a currency that nevertheless raised enough money through the <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogesled">Dogesled</a> fundraiser to help send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics.</p>

<p><a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin">Dogecoin</a> was noted as an exemplary virtual currency, in part because unlike Bitcoin it's not worth very much and in part because the Dogecoin community is willing to spend it rather than hoard it. So people give Dogecoin tips readily - a few Dogecoin for posting a funny picture of a dog - and are generous in sharing.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not even the first of the efforts to create alternative currencies on the internet. I worked at First Virtual Holdings in the 90s, which is one of the payment mechanisms discussed in a Jeff Mackie-Mason paper on digital payments. Not all of these enterprises ended up well, e.g the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">E-Gold</a> system which saw its owner convicted of a conspiracy to engage in money laundering.</p>

<p>Finn talked about some of the crazy things you can do with Dogecoin, and described the <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/02/paste-goes-to-the-worlds-first-dogecoin-meetup.html">first Dogecoin meetup</a> in New York City where he noted that kombucha was for sale - payable only in Dogecoin. The conclusion I draw is that cryptocurrencies are equal parts community and technology, and that you get radically different social results when you keep the technology basically the same but change the initial conditions of community formation.</p>

<p>This over-simplifies and leaves out some really good and funny bits, but should give you some flavor for the talk. </p>

      <p>I'm not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port
the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and
start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen
in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on
a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network
connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the 
new comment stream into Disqus.</p>

<p>As I understand it it's a one-way switch with no turning back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a
responsive design for this blog. Their new "Snap"
theme gives you one design that works well on devices
of various sizes. I'm liking it so far.</p>

<p>The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of
the "blockquote" font size and weight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I'd prefer to make
  it quite a bit less bold since I don't use it so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A somewhat trickier problem is that I'm using "Markdown"
as my composition tool within Typepad instead of HTML,
and that works only somewhat well with the new automated
summary system. If I use Markdown punctuation in the first
paragraph or so of the text it shows up as punctuation rather
than HTML rendered text in the summary body on the home page.
That's a minor enough issue and one easy enough to fix if I
had to that I'm letting that slide.</p>

<p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and <a href="http://www.orgnet.com/divided.html">book-buying habits show a schism</a> between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.</p>

<p><a href="http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/index.html">Wayne Baker</a>'s new book <a href="http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/united-america.html">United America</a> looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. He has identified 10 beliefs that are widely held across political boundaries and uses this survey information to tell a story of how an shared American identity emerges from this study.</p>

<p>I talked with Dr. Baker the other day after having read the book. We discussed in more depth some of the survey techniques as well as our shared surprise at the results. What was most interesting was a discussion of which shared values did not make the cut. For example, he identifies "symbolic patriotism", an emotional connection to the country triggered by the flag or the national anthem, as a shared value. What didn't make the cut was "blind patriotism", an "our country right or wrong" point of view. That type of patriotic fervor showed a wide variety of responses across the American spectrum, whereas the symbolic and emotional response to national icons was much more uniform and common.</p>

<p>The book is based on survey results that are in the publication process. More information about the survey and its surprising results are at <a href="http://www.OurValues.org">www.OurValues.org</a>.</p>

      <p>In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a container holding radioactive materials was reported to be leaking after it was dropped. Subsequent investigation showed that there was no contamination and there were no injuries reported.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later, the Halifax Fire Department confirmed that four cylanders containing uranium hexafluoride fell from a container, but there was no leak of radioactive material. The fire department also said no one had been injured or contaminated as a result of the incident. Emergency officials were not expecting to have to evacuate anyone. It is believed the container was being loaded onto the deck of the Swedish-built Atlantic Companion when it dropped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier, there had been fears of elevated radiation levels, per this CBC News story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leak began when a container being loaded onto the deck of the Atlantic Companion dropped. The incident happened around 10 p.m. Thursday. The fire department went to test for radioactivity at the Ceres terminal. The first team found nothing, but a second test picked up higher than normal levels of radioactivity. The Atlantic Companion is a Swedish-built ship owned by Atlantic Container Line ACL.</p>

      <p>The challenge of being an expert is that it is hard to be one in
your own home town.</p>

<p>Expertise is valued when it comes from far away. The traveling
scholar is special for their pure understanding of a difficult
field, and they don&rsquo;t incur the baggage of being a neighbor or even
a friend. The distinguished visitor can be an exemplar of their
craft, not distracted by any complicated local entanglements.</p>

<p>If you want to be recognized as an expert you need to be prepared
to travel beyond where you are well understood out to the parts of
the world where you are known solely for your expertise. Go beyond
your narrow orbit and strike out to a place where your reputation
is solid and where you are an example of the thing you call your
own. Leave your own neighborhood behind, even if only to be seen
elsewhere as an expert on neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Expertise is a funny thing. You don&rsquo;t always get a chance to pick
what you are good at, because that can come from the views of others.
The further away those others are, the more likely they have some
essential insight into your character that your close neighbors
will never have. Look at yourself through the eyes of someone far
away and see what special characteristics appear.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was up late the other night when the news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</a> was missing came out. There was a flurry of speculation as to its whereabouts, but no hard news. I went to bed figuring that by morning the mystery would be resolved.</p>

<p>That was four days ago, and the plane is still missing and the mystery has only deepened. </p>

<p>Short of going on a search and rescue mission yourself, the closest that anyone can do to chip in on the search is to join in on <a href="http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014">Tomnod</a> which has a crowd-sourced digital image recognition system.

<blockquote>
  <p>Tomnod, a Mongolian word that translates to “Big Eye,” is owned by Colorado-based satellite company Digital Globe. The company trained five satellites on the region of the Gulf of Thailand, the plane’s last known location. The satellites transmit data and photos of the area on the Tomnod website. It is hoped that through millions of crowdsourcing volunteers acting as a large virtual search party, signs of the missing plane will be found.</p>

<p>Until the disappearance of the jet has been explained, my heart goes out to the families of those who were on board.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>First, a very lovely image from Getty Images showing the construction on North Quad. Photo by Bill White of Arbor Photography.</p>

<iframe src="//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/97708448?et=awbL4Vl0sEq1449Xk1AP9A&amp;sig=uEn5wYf7D0nc7ArpI2xdZxZ92IXJs3Co667KgCIJa3U=" width="524" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>Next, an account of the restrictions and limitations of this free embedding tool, from the weblog <a href="http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2014/03/getty-images-goes-free-is-embedding.html">The IPKat</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brand new free-to-use model, however, is not for all. In the mind of Getty Images, contents will be freely available for non-commercial usages only ["embedded images may not be used for commercial purposes", the embedding panel warns], while anyone who intends to use contents within professional activities must still ask for a classic copyright licence. Remarkably, Getty Images adopts a notion of “commercial usage” that is far more user-friendly than that adopted by some Courts in Europe. Indeed, according to what Mr Peters declared to the British Journal of Photography, Getty Images considers websites using Google-Ads a non-commercial: “the fact today that a website is generating revenue would not limit the use of the embed. What would limit that use is if they used our imagery to promote a service, a product or their business. They would need to get a license.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, even if the imagery is "free", it comes with attachments. Getty can decide to retract their license for free use at any time, leaving your blog with an empty hole where the image once was. They can collect usage information from your site, presumably extracting more information out of big data that they can use for some purpose. The commentary on The IPKat is not enthusiastic on behalf of photographers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As someone who has grown old and weary fighting Getty's 'licence first and clear the rights later, if at all' business model on behalf of impecunious photographers it is difficult to view this development with unalloyed enthusiasm</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I couldn’t verify that Sunday’s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the “lying” that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox’s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins–that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.</p>
  
  <p>But as Bitcoin experts pore over the hacked files, they may yet offer clues to the mystery around Mt. Gox’s fate. The Bitcoin community has been puzzled by the apparent lack of movement of Mt. Gox’s bitcoins since the company declared bankruptcy last month. Despite stating that it lost 850,000 bitcoins in total in its bankruptcy filing, Bitcoin experts haven’t seen the movement of those coins in the Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>SXSW is "spring break for geeks". Every year the nerd bird flies hundreds of people from San Francisco to Austin (and to be fair other airplanes fly other people from other places to Austin). There's a good solid week of product demos, parties, music, film, etc. </p>

<p>It sounds like fun, and I've never gone. I'm wondering what my alternate history would have been if I would have been a regular there - who would I know that I don't know now, what connections I'd make, etc. </p>

<p>There are people who seem to exist solely to go to conferences. I'm not one of them. My peak conference-going era was that of Usenix annual conferences and occasional NSF workshops around the NSFnet. It's fun, but exhausting, and it's hard to square up being out and about with the simple requirements of taking care of family at home.</p>

<p>So enjoy SXSW 2014! Twitter all about it! Tell us what interesting new companies are going to have a breakout moment (or not), and save a seat for me next year (which I probably won't go to). I'm reminded that I didn't go in 2012 either.</p>

<p>A review of <a href="http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/\">Social Physics</a>: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.</p>

<p>Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. Quite evidently the populations they study live routine, predictable lives. (Perhaps we all do.)</p>

<p>My biggest criticism (&amp; thus the non-recommendation for the book) is that the technologies for making these monitoring of human behavior that Pentland describes are dehumanizing and a grave insult to personal privacy. The authors vague promises of a personal data store that would broker our most personal information are unrealistic. If these plans pan out, we will always be watched over by machines that seek only to predict our patterns of behavior and exploit them. An <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/welcome-to-algorithmic-prison/283985/">algorithmic prison</a> awaits us.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the author describes unexpected behavior by individuals thus modeled, and betrays an element of surprise that we might step out of our everyday paths into something his system doesn't contain. It's a glimmer of hope in a dystopian world that we might surprise our ever-present overseers and do something that their social physics does not anticipate.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> has had a series of bad days. Their site has been under a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for a number of days. To mitigate the problem, they are using the <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> service, but even that has not been working great.</p>

<p>The net effect is that sometimes the Meetup.com site is unavailable, making it hard to sign up or schedule or reschedule events. The Meetup periodic announcements about the problem emphasize how hard they are working to fix it and how user credit cards are not at risk.</p>

<p>I've been happily using Meetup to organize the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">A2B3 weekly Thursday lunch series</a> that I run, as well as a monthly <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">Ann Arbor civic technology meetup</a> and a monthly Web Analtyics Wednesday meetup.

      </h3>
      <p>The latest in the Bitcoin saga is a crisis at Mt Gox, one of the major Bitcoin exchanges in the world. A few judicious news clippings will give you a sense of the chaos.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Bitcoinity-mt-gox-crash" title="Bitcoinity-mt-gox-crash" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/26/us-mtgox-website-idUSBREA1O07920140226">Reuters</a>: Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox goes dark in blow to virtual currency</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The website of Mt. Gox suddenly went dark on Tuesday with no explanation, and the company's Tokyo office was empty - the only activity was outside, where a handful of protesters said they had lost money investing in the virtual currency.</p>
  
  <p>Hours later, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told Reuters in an email: "We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell much more for now as this also involves other parties." He did not elaborate on the details or give his location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/business/apparent-theft-at-mt-gox-shakes-bitcoin-world.html?_r=0">New York Times</a>: Apparent Theft at Mt. Gox Shakes Bitcoin World</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday night, a number of leading Bitcoin companies jointly announced that Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for most of Bitcoin’s existence, was planning to file for bankruptcy after months of technological problems and what appeared to have been a major theft. A document circulating widely in the Bitcoin world said the company had lost 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft that had gone unnoticed for years. That would be about 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document circulating widely is this <a href="http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/77760399932/update-on-mt-gox-this-document-appears-to-be">crisis plan</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that “transaction malleability” caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it. Gox’s own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years. The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The underlying problem is "transaction malleability", and how Mt Gox's software didn't account for it when approving trades. From Ed Felten's <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/understanding-bitcoins-transaction-malleability-problem/">Freedom to Tinker</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been known since roughly 2011 that signed transactions are slightly “malleable” in the sense that it is possible to modify a signed transaction in certain minor ways, without invalidating the signature. The critical details about payment—who is paying how much, and to whom—can’t be changed, but certain peripheral information can be modified in a way that causes the transaction ID to change. [Technical detail for crypto nerds: This happens because the transaction ID is computed by hashing a set of fields that is a superset of the fields covered by the signature.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mostly dormant crypto nerd in me rolls my eyes, but of course this was not an obvious problem to those first looking at Bitcoin. I don't know off hand if other cryptocoins like Dogecoin have the same transaction malleability flaw.</p>

<p>Obituary: Richard "Rich" Walker Wiggins (February 28, 1956 - February 8, 2014) </p>

<p>Passed away February 8, 2014 in Holt, MI. Born Feb. 28th, 1956, in Chicago, IL, and raised in Decatur, AL, Rich was a proud son of a chief engineer of NASA's Skylab Space Station. A high achiever throughout his life, Rich attended <a href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>, where he worked later for many years as a systems programmer and manager, retiring as a Senior Information Technologist in 2010. Always a visionary, Rich will be remembered primarily as a champion of the Internet -- speaking, teaching, and publishing about its potential. An outstanding communicator, he wrote one of the earliest books about the Internet -- "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Internet-Everyone-Providers-Workstation/dp/0070670196">The Internet for Everyone: A Guide for Users and Providers</a>", published by McGraw-Hill in 1994. The vanity plate on his car? "INTRNET".</p>

<p>Rich was consulted by and featured in numerous national media venues, including The New York Times (his beloved, must-read newspaper). Local TV and radio stations called upon him frequently for appearances and commentary. With his good friend Charles Severance, he appeared regularly on a popular segment of <a href="http://wkar.org/">WKAR</a>'s AM 870 NewsTalk radio program, debating contemporary technology topics and giving computer advice to callers. Rich and Chuck also co-hosted a national television program -- "<a href="http://vimeo.com/3776888">Internet: TCI</a>", from 1994-1997. An enthusiastic team leader, Rich played a significant role in moving Michigan State University forward into the new world of the Internet.</p>

<p>Rich was a brilliant, charming and complicated man who made friends everywhere. He was eager to debate politics and discuss the latest news with anyone, and was known as a relentless punster. Warm weather was one of his passions; he could be seen wearing shorts and sandals well into November, adamantly refusing to acknowledge the end of summer. He loved Lake Michigan, Key West, Canada, MSU's Summer Circle plays, the Moody Blues, Wendy's iced tea, and El Azteco. Rich treasured all of his friends, relatives, and colleagues. He is gone from us far too soon.</p>

<p>Rich was preceded in death by his parents, Herbert H. Wiggins, Sr. and Ethel Gardiner Wiggins; and his brothers, David and Herbert Jr. He is survived by numerous cousins.</p>

<p>A Memorial Service will be held Saturday, March 1, 2014 at Palmer, Bush &amp; Jensen Family Funeral Homes Holt-Delhi Chapel, Holt, MI. Visitation will begin at 12:00PM, followed by a 1:00PM service. Friends are invited to gather afterwards for refreshments. In lieu of flowers, Rich requested specifically that donations be made to the Michigan State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Condolences can be made at <a href="http://www.palmerbush.com">www.palmerbush.com</a>.</p>

<p>I'm trying out <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. Here are some first impressions.</p>

<p>The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks. For the ubergeeks, it also has a very competent IRC client support.</p>

<p>The experience of the system varies tremendously depending on who you have on your team. If they have somewhere else to talk, then you might never get the critical mass you need to have a real conversation online. About a third of the people I'm inviting actually start to use the system, and most of those have some IRC channel time in their background.</p>

<p>The web client and the Android client for Slack are both very capably executed and feel like sound, solid pieces of engineering. It adds a lot of confidence to using the system to have such nice tools to work with.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">integrations</a> configured for RSS feeds, for Github (issues and commits), and for Google Hangouts. There's a rich API, or so it seems, and lots of other systems that have had integrations built for them. I have ambitions but no infrastructure yet to write my own code or better yet borrow other people's code to extend the system. I'm not much more advanced yet than getting the "hello world" style post-to-Slack-from-the-command-line capability going, but it did work, so I have high hopes.</p>

<p>The slack server I have set up is running on their free trial, which has a limited number of integration slots. I think that by cleverly enabling and disabling services that I can try enough of them to build up some experience with the system, but not necessarily run everything in production. I get 5 for free, and Github, Hangouts, RSS, Twitter, and the incoming webhook make up that 5.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what I've built and join in, drop me a line and I can send you an invite.</p>

<p>The Atlanta area is expecting severe weather and ice the week of February 12, 2014, according to the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/winters-storm-warnings-advisories-and-watches-fore/ndJgM/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this time, it’s not just the snow. It’s the ice that has forecasters and government leaders most concerned. And the worst of the storm may not roll through until Wednesday, according to chief meteorologist Glenn Burns with Channel 2 Action News.</p>
  
  <p>“Do be prepared for massive power outages as this is likely to be a massive weather event,” Burns said Monday evening.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Depending on the source you get a slightly different story, but the results are the same: there is a lot of volatility in Bitcoin pricing in early February 2014 because of problems at the Mt. Gox exchange. So much for a technologically pristine, mathematically pure, decentralized currency; when your "foreign exchange" depends on a very small number of businesses, it can have systematic vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Coindesk, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/mt-gox-first-bitcoin-exchange-dead/">Why Mt. Gox, the World’s First Bitcoin Exchange, is Dying</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mt. Gox, the world’s original and once-largest bitcoin exchange, appears to be in a state of disarray after it suspended bitcoin withdrawals to work on what it said were technical issues. Meanwhile, the clamour of angry customer voices is growing.</p>
  
  <p>The exchange’s moves have had a negative impact on the bitcoin markets. The price of 1 BTC plunged from $850 at the start of the week to $681, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, in the wake of the Gox announcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business Insider quotes the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mtgox-halts-withdrawals-2014-2">Mt Gox letter to customers</a> on the freeze in withdrawals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We apologize for the sudden short notice. All bitcoin withdrawal requests will be on pause, and the withdrawals in the system will be returned to your MtGox wallet and can be reinitiated once the issue is resolved. The trading platform will perform as usual for the needs of our customers.   </p>
  
  <p>Our team will resolve this problem as soon as possible and will provide an update on Monday, February 10, 2014 (JST).  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to "listen" to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Fldigi-HB9ERN" title="Fldigi-HB9ERN" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. Here's what I have:</p>

<p><a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">WebSDR</a> from http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/ . This is a software-defined radio tuning  to the radio airwaves at the University of Twente in the Netherlands; it runs in your browser. There are 87 of these systems running around the world, listed at <a href="http://websdr.org/">websdr.org</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html">fldigi</a> from http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html . This software for Windows, Linux and OS X, runs on your local system and takes an audio signal and decodes it in one of many digital modes.</p>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/">Soundflower</a> from https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/ . This is a Mac system extension that allows you to redirect the audio output of one program (e.g. your browser) into the audio input of another program (e.g. fldigi). Not strictly necessary because the fldigi can also just decode whatever it hears through the computer's built in microphone. I picked up the recommendation from an article on <a href="http://www.hamradioandvision.com/websdr-digital-modes/">HamRadioAndVision</a>.</p>

<p>A number of people have done Youtube videos describing what they are doing to make this work. For example, <a href="http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/component/content/article/63-sdr/290-fun-with-websdr-and-fldigi">OZ9AEC</a> has a 6 minute Youtube from 2009 shows reception in single channel and multichannel mode. He doesn't use Soundflower, just the built in mic of his Mac.</p>

<p>Not described here - and probably what I need to figure out next - are two key bits of information. Where do you tune to pick up digital signals? And, more importantly, which decoder do you use? It's not hard to pick out which modulation is being used if you have some practice, but as of this writing I couldn't readily tell you what WEFAX sounds like compared to RTTY. Still sorting through those details before I can claim to have mastered this.</p>

<p>Note also that this should work with a local software-defined radio as well, or even with a "hardware-defined radio" placed near your mic or patched in with a mic cable.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Because it's that time of year when sidewalks are full of snow and ice.</p>

<h3>4:60. Snow and ice.</h3>

<p>All snow and ice which has accumulated prior to 6:00 a.m. on a public sidewalk adjacent to property not zoned residentially shall be removed by the owner or occupant by noon. Immediately after the accumulation of ice on such sidewalk it shall be treated with sand, salt or other substance to prevent it from being slippery and the ice shall be removed within the time limits of this paragraph.</p>

<p>Except for sidewalks defined by section 4:51(1)(b) and (c), within 24 hours after the end of each accumulation of snow greater than 1 inch, the owner or occupant of every residentially zoned property shall remove the accumulation from the adjacent public sidewalk and walks and ramps leading to a crosswalk. The accumulation may be from any source including precipitation and drifting. Immediately after the accumulation of ice on such sidewalk, it shall be treated with sand, salt or other substance to prevent it from being slippery and the ice shall be removed within 24 hours after accumulation.</p>

<p>All property zoned PL (public land) shall have snow and ice removed as if it held the same zoning classification as the adjacent property. The removal of snow and ice shall mean free of snow and ice for the entire constructed width and length of the sidewalk, including walks and ramps leading to a crosswalk.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 1, 12-21-92; Ord. No. 49-01, § 3, 10-15-01; Ord. No. 13-15, § 1, 10-21-13)</p>

<h3>4:61. Removal by city.</h3>

<p>If snow or ice is not removed or treated as required section 4:60, the city may notify the owner or occupant of the violation of section 4:60. This notification may be made in person, by telephone, by mail or by written notice left at the property. If the owner or occupant fails to remove snow or ice within 24 hours of the notification of violation of section 4:60, the city may cause such snow or ice to be removed. The owner (as indicated by the records of the assessor) of the adjacent property shall then be charged the actual cost of the sidewalk clearance, plus an administrative fee of $50.00. If that charge is not paid within 45 days, it may be assessed against the parcel under section 1:292 of this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 83-70, 10-13-70; Ord. No. 46-77, 1-23-78; Ord. No. 81-81, 12-7-81; Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 2, 12-21-92)</p>

<h3>4:62. Financial hardship.</h3>

<p>Upon proof of financial hardship the Administrator may authorize charges under section 4:61 to be paid in installments, to be reduced, or to be cancelled and will be subject to Council approval.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 11-75, 2-10-75; Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86)</p>

<h3>4:63. Penalty.</h3>

<p>The owner (as shown on the assessor's records) of the property with adjacent sidewalks which do not comply with section 4:60, who fails to comply with the notice given in section 4:61, shall be responsible for a civil infraction, which shall be punishable by a civil fine of not less than $100.00 for the first offense, not less than $250.00 and up to $500.00 for the second offense, and not less than $500.00 and up to $1,000.00 for each additional or subsequent offense within a 2-year time period, plus costs and all other remedies available by statute.. The maximum fine for any offense shall not exceed $1,000.00. If the penalty is not paid within 45 days, it may be assessed against the parcel under section 1:292 of this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 3, 12-21-92; Ord. No. 25-04, § 4, 8-2-04)</p>
