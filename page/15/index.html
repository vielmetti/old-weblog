<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/news/sick-of-web-comments-us-too-heres-what-were-doing-about-it/">Chicago Sun-Times</a> has given up on publishing reader comments on its stories, at least for now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting this weekend, the Chicago Sun-Times and the other titles in the Sun-Times Media group will temporarily cease to run comments with our articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? If you've read newspaper comments, you'll know why already: they are awful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world of Internet commenting offers a marvelous opportunity for discussion and the exchange of ideas. But as anyone who has ever ventured into a comment thread can attest, these forums too often turn into a morass of negativity, racism, hate speech and general trollish behaviors that detract from the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes time, effort, energy, and love to engage with readers enough to make the stream of their comments to be anywhere near as worthwhile to read as the professionally produced stories that sit at the top of the page. Too often the news organization treats comments as an afterthought, or if they do think about it they are woefully unprepared to handle the burden.</p>

<p>It hasn't always been the case, of course. Once upon a time (he says, shaking his cane) the letter to the editor was carefully edited, double checked for identity, and only run with some consideration. For the most part, newspapers have given up on their opportunity to corral the best of public discussion into their own pages, leaving it instead for the idiots on parade.</p>

<p>More about the Sun-Times decision:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fark.com/comments/8218801/Chicago-Sun-Times-will-not-let-readers-comment-on-articles-because-according-to-managing-editor-internet-comments-are-a-morass-of-negativity-racism-hate-speech-Good-thing-hes-never-visited-Fark-Politics-tab">Fark</a> says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As frank as FARK comments can be, the worst seen here excel far beyond the idiocy seen on newspapers. At least Farkers have brains</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/247525/sun-times-kills-comments-until-it-can-fix-morass-of-negativity-racism-and-hate-speech/">Poynter</a> reviews other news organizations that gave up on comments, including Popular Science.</p>

<p><a href="http://chicagoist.com/2014/04/12/the_sun-times_temporarily_shuts_dow.php">Chicagoist</a> gives sage advice: "A sage piece of Internet advice is often a simple one: don't read the comments."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/April-2014/Turning-Internet-Comments-into-Dialogue-Isnt-Easy-or-Cheap/">Chicago Magazine</a> understands the cost of turning reader contributions into something useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turning readers’ invective into smart dialogue is not a new challenge—but now, it’s a bigger problem than ever. Solving it takes a lot of manpower, and some well-designed software.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook is changing; in this particualr case it's a reorganization of the messaging functions into their own app. From <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/facebook-messenger-or-the-highway/">Techcrunch</a>, the predictable cries of frustration from people who are used to what they have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still, a unilateral forced migration is the exact kind of change Facebook users hate, and this will only breed more paranoia that their social network could change without their consent. Taking a slower “We’re switching everyone eventually, so you might as well do it now” approach might have gone over better than “Your familiar chat interface will be destroyed in two weeks whether you like it or not”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't like it when our telescreen is changed.</p>

<p>The telescreen is from George Orwell's 1984. An <a href="http://www.theorwellreader.com/excerpt.shtml">excerpt</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plate commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You have to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. </p>

      <p>I am trying to write something about the sad state of local news, but it's pretty discouraging. A bad mix of unfiltered PR, unedited political invective, endless stenography, and tedium is par for the course. Why oh why don't we have a better press corps?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every day, read the email. Answer, as best you can, yesterday's email. The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today.html">yesterbox</a> technique helps out, though it's not perfect.</p>

<p>Follow interesting people on Twitter, but not too many interesting people. Manage the tricky relationship of "friending" people on Facebook, knowing full well once you have befriended someone it's a huge social transgression to unfriend them, even if you don't care for their particular brand of cat videos or politics. Post something clever enough frequently enough.</p>

<p>Attend to the matter of staying in touch with people who are a long ways away, hoping that they will come to town during travel season. I have been using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager.html">Contactually</a> to help me sort through making sure that people don't completely drop off the map. Every day I could reanimate a half dozen old relationships; I'm lucky to do that once a week. </p>

<p>Somewhere all in here, post to this blog. I think I've reached the era of peak blogging. This site has steady state traffic that's not overwhelming, and if I want to get comments on something it's easier to post to Facebook. I keep posting out of a sense of diligence, because I've been doing it for a long time, and because there are some things that you need to be diligent about even if there is no obvious reason why.</p>


  <h3>7 April 2014</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-07-how-are-you-going-to-keep-them-down-on-the-farm-after-theyve-seen-5d/">How are you going to keep them down on the farm, after they&#39;ve seen 5D?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game "2048". (No, I won't link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating <a href="http://cesarkawakami.github.io/2048-5D/">2048 5D</a> I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. </p>

<p>5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it. You use the arrow keys to navigate in small steps, AWSD to navigate in larger steps, and QE for the largest steps. Of course the steps aren't really larger when you consider the full dimensions of the space, but based on how the cells are laid down on a flat screen that's a reasonable approximation.</p>

<p>After successfully navigating a 5D space, the traditional presentation of a list as a scrolling 1-dimensional space, or even a web browser's narrow navigational confines, seems impossibly small. I can page up and down in a browser, but what would it mean to page left and right? Or to page in and out, or hither and yon? (Pick some more navigational opposites.) Tabs help a little bit for the left-right navigation, and windows perhaps are the in-out method, but what of hither and yon?</p>

<p>Here's a small proposal. The browser could keep track not just of the history of which pages you have seen in the past, but also the order that you've seen them in. Over time, that flow history turns into a graph of expected page transitions. Your browser could respond to some command that was "show me the next page I'm likely to go to", and that would be inferred by the history mechanism. The "next" button would always be active.</p>

<p>I suppose this is related to my routine preference for guided randomness in my work. I would rather not try to work my way down a list where I decide explicitly what to do next. Rather, the computer uses some algorithm to select a next thing (a roll of the dice, or some weighted choice) and that's the next thing to do. With the right sorts of dimensional logic, there could be a couple of different things that would be reasonably "next" and they would be surprising but plausible next things to work through.</p>

<p>What's kind of sad is that the hyperspace of my idealistic youth - where the network was big, and you used spatial metaphors to zoom down information pathways of your own choosing - has been replaced by the UIs of Facebook, Twitter, or even email where the "read the top, refresh, read the top again" is what you're guided down. There's no more chasing down endless hyperlinks - everything you might want is predigested and put in front of you, and if you don't like it you can just hit refresh like some slot-machine player and hope for better.</p>

<p>So I want some space to work in, not just lists, and not just read from the top. Let me decorate rooms with ideas, and traverse some kind of non-linear structure to get from one idea to the next. Vannevar Bush's "memex" had trails that led through it, and it didn't pretend that you could instantly go from one idea to the next without passing through something else. When I think I want to carve out some space for thinking, and have it be something other than the infinite scrolling list. </p>

<p>Developed in 2008 by Brian Solis, The [Conversation Prism] is a visual map of the social media landscape. It’s an ongoing study in digital ethnography that tracks dominant and promising social networks and organizes them by how they’re used in everyday life.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/05/the-conversation-prism-as-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-a2b3-lunch.html">In 2009</a>, I wrote up how the a2b3 lunch organizes itself through the eye of the this system. I ran across it again, and decided to do a repeat.</p>

<p>[Conversation Prism]; https://conversationprism.com
* Social networks: Facebook, Yahoo Groups</p>

<p>You'll see Yahoo Groups show up in lots of the entries, because the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 mailing list</a> is the heart and soul of the whole effort. Facebook plays second fiddle, with a lot less people watching the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2207503206/">a2b3 group on Facebook</a>, and a lot less traffic to that group.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog: Typepad</li>
</ul>

<p>See the a2b3 <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/a2b3">category on my Typepad blog</a> . Mostly the specific thing that gets blogged about is the a2b3 lunch non-summaries, which I like going back to but which also take enough time to do that I don't always do them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crowd Wisdom: Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
<li>Questions and answers: Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>The crowd is good about answering almost any reasonable question you throw at it, either at lunchtime or on the mailing list, and coming up with an answer. We don't need Quora or their ilk to get a good answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments: Disqus, Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>I converted over this Typepad install to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/03/the-next-major-change-for-this-weblog-is-converting-over-comments-to-disqus.html">Disqus comments</a>, but really, the comments are in the discussions on the mailing list and over lunch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social commerce: ?</li>
<li>Social marketplace: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>No one yet has found a reason or a compelling method to sell things to each other, which is fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social streams: Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an <a href="http://twitter.com/a2b3">@a2b3 twitter feed</a> that I very occasionally post to which has 500+ followers and only 150+ tweets. There's an opportunity to improve on that effort. If I could, I would automatically tweet out the stream from Meetup, but I haven't figured out yet how IFTTT plays with Meetup.</p>

<ul>
<li>Location: Meetup, Foursquare</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/">a2b3 Meetup</a> answers the question of "where is lunch going to be", and provides nice maps. It's the one piece of the 2009 landscape that was missing, and I'm happy with the results. Foursquare answers the question of "where do you eat lunch". I put together a [map of recent a2b3 lunch spots on Foursquare] without too much work. Perhaps I'll start checking in on Foursquare.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nicheworking: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>What is this I don't even.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enterprise: Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>The enterprisiest tool I have for lunch is the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/02/slack-first-impressions.html">a2b3 Slack instance</a>, a closed system (you're invited, just ask) which does chat (a la IRC) and newsfeed syndication. It's great as a tool, but it's not just the right fit for this particular group.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wiki: Arborwiki (Localwiki)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> is a perfect fit for a local lunch group, because you can stash away answers to questions about the area as they come up and then refer back to them later as needed. <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> has been running for 8+ years and has been a tremendous asset to a2b3.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion and forums: Yahoo Groups</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 Yahoo Group</a> is the key to the whole system. Without it, I guess I'd reconstruct a mailing list with Google Groups. Please don't ever ruin it, Yahoo!</p>

<ul>
<li>Business: LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<p>LinkedIn groups can be tedious to manage, and their discussion forums never took off. However, it's an easy way to read people's resumes, so there's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?featured=&amp;gid=36174">a LinkedIn group for a2b3</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Service networking: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what this is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't need a separate review system when <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> is there to either catch reviews or at least to point to same on Yelp. For real-time reviews in response to queries, there's the Yahoo group. Who's Angie?</p>

<ul>
<li>Social curation: Pinterest</li>
</ul>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/vielmetti/a2b3/">add a map to a Pinterest board</a>, you can pin Foursquare locations and their photos. So I did.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video: Youtube, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a "how to organize lunch" video from Ignite Ann Arbor 3.</p>

<p><iframe width="600" height="450" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/a5BS9_-UAYo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<ul>
<li>Content / documents: a2docs (Scribd)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://a2docs.org">a2docs</a> is a place to stash government records for the Ann Arbor area. It's powered by <a href="http://www.scribd.com/A2Docs/documents">Scribd</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Events: Meetup</li>
</ul>

<p>Meetup is new to the group since 2013. Over the span of 6 months I've used it to organize two dozen events. Meetup is a little bit pricy for what you get, but they have timing for meetup updates down pat and a very low-impact way of keeping people informed. Join the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/">a2b3 Meetup</a> to get weekly announcements of lunch locations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Music: Soundcloud</li>
</ul>

<p>The official a2b3 chime (played at 12:30pm on Thursdays) is hosted on Soundcloud.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97501588&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<ul>
<li>Livecasting: Ustream</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't livecast meetings as a rule, but if we did, it would probably be through Ustream which I've used for other events.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social bookmarks: pinboard.in</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:a2b3">a2b3 tag on pinboard</a> captures bookmarks. Bookmarking is not from this decade, and thus it's not religiously kept up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Influence: Klout, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>I only say this because former a2b3 regular Joe Cothrel works at Lithium, which just acquired Klout.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quantified self: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all about keeping track of what you do (e.g. tracking exercise with a pedometer or a phone) and sharing that with yourself or the world. Several people in the group do this but we haven't all coalesced on any single platform to share.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-25-interview-with-douglas-perlin-author-of-a2parking-android-application/">Interview with Douglas Perlin, author of a2parking Android application</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This interview of Douglas Perlin, author of the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/03/a2parking-app-provides-android-users-with-access-to-real-time-information-about-ann-arbor-parking-st.html">a2parking</a> Android application for locating Ann Arbor parking structures, was done via email. It is lightly edited to include hyperlinks.</p>

<ol>
<li>When did you get the idea to do an a2parking application, and how long did it take you to go from idea to first version?</li>
</ol>

<p>In October or November 2011 I was looking at the <a href="http://a2dda.org">a2dda website</a> and happened to see the parking space availability on one of the pages.  I thought it would be nice to have a phone app that could pull up the parking availability data..  It took about a week or two to get the first version up on google play. The original version was kind of clunky I used <a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a> to extract the data from a2dda web page and wrote a little code to clean it up.  </p>

<ol>
<li>How long has the software been out in the world?</li>
</ol>

<p>The app was first published to google play on November 11, 2011.  Sometime around the opening of the new Library Lane parking structure the data and web page disappeared.  I guess a2dda or Republic Parking was upgrading the system.  I guess sometime around August 2013 the <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json">data was made available through a JSON link</a> but I wasn’t aware of it at that time.  For some reason in early March of this year I was thinking about removing the spaces page since it was coming up blank and just leaving the navigation page.  I logged into my Google app.things account and there was an email from Republic Parking informing me about the JSON data so I decided to upgrade the app and that's what you see now.</p>

<ol>
<li>Who do you envision as using the system?</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess I never really thought about it.  Probably someone from out of town looking for directions to parking structure. </p>

<ol>
<li>Have you talked at all to the DDA or to Republic Parking?</li>
</ol>

<p>I never talked to anyone at DDA or Republic Parking.  I did send email to DDA from my regular email account to find out what happened to the data in when it disappeared.  I got a quick response letting me know that the system was being upgraded.  The thing that really surprised me was when my app.things account received and email from Republic Parking with the JSON link information since I never really wrote to them and my email to the DDA was from a different account.  Not sure how they found out about the app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there more information you'd like to gather regarding parking data (e.g. pricing, trending of availability, historical or predictive numbers)?</li>
</ol>

<p>The menu has an information screen choice which lists structures and lots and when one is tapped it will pull hours and pricing from the JSON link.  I’m not really tracking the trends or making predictions.</p>

<ol>
<li>What's your favorite parking place? Your favorite free place to park?</li>
</ol>

<p>Hahaa! I’m a local. I’m pretty good at finding free places to park. That being said I prefer to take the bus and cabs when I come into town since its way cheaper than a DUI.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell a little bit about yourself and how you got started programming.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m retired. I was a Network Administrator/Network Security Officer for many years.  Programming is just a hobby and I’m pretty much of a hack at it since I don’t devote a lot of time to it. I started programming on an Apple II in basic. Then as time passed I moved on to more languages like Pascal, C, perl, and then Java. In the case of the parking app I just wanted to learn how to write a phone app.</p>

<p>Dan Romanchik, KB6NU will be conducting the next One-Day Tech Class will be held on Saturday, May 3, 2014 from 9am to 3pm at  the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, 220 E. Ann St. Ann Arbor, MI 48104.  Immediately after the class, the Technician Class license exam will be administered. </p>

<p>Pre-registration is required, and there is a $10 fee to take the class. We often fill the class and have to put people on the waiting list. So, if you'd like to take this class, you should send a check or money order sooner rather than later to reserve their spot. Dan's address is 1325 Orkney Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. People can also pay via PayPal by sending $10 to cwgeek@kb6nu.com.</p>

<p>There is also a $15 fee to take the test. This fee is payable to the volunteer examiners just before they take the test. DO NOT send me the $15 exam fee.</p>

<p>Prospective students can download the study guide from <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual">www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual</a>. Read through it a couple of times and take some online practice tests (URLs for practice test websites can be found in the study guide) before taking the test.  They greatly increase the chances that you will pass the test if you do some studying beforehand.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please send an email to cwgeek@kb6nu.com or phone Dan at 734-930-6564.</p>

<p>Now in its sixth year, the Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire features dozens of makers from across the region and draws over three thousand members of the community for the day’s free events. Metalworkers, inventors, papermakers, artists, students, robot designers, enthusiasts and professional alike teach the public how they make their work. </p>

<p>Many participants come away with more than just inspiration, but new skills they can use to fuel their own creations and lasting connections to other makers and resources in the region.</p>

<p>May 10, 2014 marks the second time the Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire will be hosted by Washtenaw Community College. This free, all-ages event features community members of all types who come together to display their ideas, projects, and inventions. </p>

<p>We will be seeking applications from people and groups with engaging, inspiring, and just plain cool projects.  Projects should have a focus on the process of creating, designing, and making - not just displaying a final product.  Makers of all ages and experience levels are encouraged to submit applications. We will begin seeking applications for makers in the next few weeks. </p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kestenbaum/posts/10153926911120537">From Facebook</a> and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum:</p>

<p>Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no "stay" pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately.</p>

<p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so. But in the meantime, Judge Friedman's ruling is the final word on the matter.</p>

<p>My Vital Records office will be open tomorrow, Saturday (March 22, 2014), from 9am to 1pm, to accept applications and issue marriage licenses. We anticipate that we will be able to process about 60 applications. After 1pm, the staff will not be available. I apologize in advance to those we will have to turn away.</p>

<p>Of course, we will be giving out numbers on a first-come, first-served basis, but first, we will honor the numbers we gave out last October.</p>

<p>Note that applicants should bring the documents specified on our web site, and $20.01 (for residents of Washtenaw County) or $30.01 (if both members of the couple live out of state). If either member of the couple live in Michigan, and neither one lives in Washtenaw County, you have to go to your own county.</p>

<p>The additional one cent is the fee (set by the Board of Commissioners) for immediate processing of the marriage license. I anticipate that those who apply tomorrow will want immediate processing. If you don't need your marriage license right away, please wait until Monday.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The weekly a2b3 lunch met at Madras Masala on this the third Thursday of March. It's been our habit to meet at Madras on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays. The dining room is large and could seat a large party, but our typical lunch has rarely less than 6 and rarely more than 8 people there, which is just about perfect.</p>

<p>This week's tally was 6, which is just barely big enough to justify a formal round of introductions, but we did it anyway. The discussion, minus the introductions, ranged widely from the workings of lathes to the scene at Community High School to the everyday objects that we carry with us each day. I won't even try to summarize, there was just so much to say that we talked non-stop for 90 minutes and were still chatting at the end.</p>

<p>As always the food at Madras was good, and just spicy enough that some people who had been regulars aren't likely to come because the diet does not agree with them. To this end we are planning a west side visit to Chela's on March 27, 2014. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/events/168490202/">See the details on Meetup</a>, and hope to see you there.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang'an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online.</p>

<p>Notes from a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/finn-brunton-the-accidental-archive-notes-on-a-talk-monday-january-28-2013.html">2013 talk by Finn Brunton on The Accidental Archive</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Notes from the talk follow here. I kept a running log with Twitter, and I'm writing this from my Pinboard <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:bitcoin">bitcoin bookmarks</a>; these links are to the bookmarks for ease of linking for the most park. I'm not trying to reconstruct the talk, just to give context for my bookmarks!</p>

<p>The talk started off with a discussion of the Audrey Hepburn film <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti/t:charade">Charade</a>, in which the mystery of what happened to the wealth of a family is only resolved when it's realized that rather than searching for lost money that they should be trying to make sense of the tail of rare stamps. This was the kickoff to an extended and wide-ranging discussion of the various roles and purposes of money throughout history and how very odd things that don't look like currency at all still functioned as stores of value, units of account, or mediums of exchange.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has peculiar mathematical properties that make it unusually suited for use as a store of value. Bitcoins are mined through a process that's NP-hard, which means for practical purposes that it's difficult to create them but easy to prove that they are real. Bitcoin is a "proof of work"; someone did something hard, consuming scarce computing power and copious amounts of energy, in order to accomplish a task that's easy to confirm. </p>

<p>Finn talked about other coin systems (usually lumped under the term "altcoin") that are based on Bitcoin but that are run separately and have their own twists. There's <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:allahcoin">Allahcoin</a>, which donates a percentage of each transaction to the Muslim Brotherhood; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:aphroditecoin">Aphroditecoin</a>, which is doing an "air drop" to give citizens of Cyprus their own money; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:mazacoin">Mazacoin</a>, from the Oglala Lakota Nation; <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:freicoin">Freicoin</a>, which depreciates through "demurrage" if you don't spend it; and most notably <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin">Dogecoin</a>, a joke of a currency that nevertheless raised enough money through the <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogesled">Dogesled</a> fundraiser to help send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics.</p>

<p><a href="https://pinboard.in/t:dogecoin">Dogecoin</a> was noted as an exemplary virtual currency, in part because unlike Bitcoin it's not worth very much and in part because the Dogecoin community is willing to spend it rather than hoard it. So people give Dogecoin tips readily - a few Dogecoin for posting a funny picture of a dog - and are generous in sharing.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not even the first of the efforts to create alternative currencies on the internet. I worked at First Virtual Holdings in the 90s, which is one of the payment mechanisms discussed in a Jeff Mackie-Mason paper on digital payments. Not all of these enterprises ended up well, e.g the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold">E-Gold</a> system which saw its owner convicted of a conspiracy to engage in money laundering.</p>

<p>Finn talked about some of the crazy things you can do with Dogecoin, and described the <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/02/paste-goes-to-the-worlds-first-dogecoin-meetup.html">first Dogecoin meetup</a> in New York City where he noted that kombucha was for sale - payable only in Dogecoin. The conclusion I draw is that cryptocurrencies are equal parts community and technology, and that you get radically different social results when you keep the technology basically the same but change the initial conditions of community formation.</p>

<p>This over-simplifies and leaves out some really good and funny bits, but should give you some flavor for the talk. </p>

      <p>I'm not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port
the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and
start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen
in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on
a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network
connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the 
new comment stream into Disqus.</p>

<p>As I understand it it's a one-way switch with no turning back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a
responsive design for this blog. Their new "Snap"
theme gives you one design that works well on devices
of various sizes. I'm liking it so far.</p>

<p>The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of
the "blockquote" font size and weight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I'd prefer to make
  it quite a bit less bold since I don't use it so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A somewhat trickier problem is that I'm using "Markdown"
as my composition tool within Typepad instead of HTML,
and that works only somewhat well with the new automated
summary system. If I use Markdown punctuation in the first
paragraph or so of the text it shows up as punctuation rather
than HTML rendered text in the summary body on the home page.
That's a minor enough issue and one easy enough to fix if I
had to that I'm letting that slide.</p>

<p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and <a href="http://www.orgnet.com/divided.html">book-buying habits show a schism</a> between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.</p>

<p><a href="http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/index.html">Wayne Baker</a>'s new book <a href="http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/united-america.html">United America</a> looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. He has identified 10 beliefs that are widely held across political boundaries and uses this survey information to tell a story of how an shared American identity emerges from this study.</p>

<p>I talked with Dr. Baker the other day after having read the book. We discussed in more depth some of the survey techniques as well as our shared surprise at the results. What was most interesting was a discussion of which shared values did not make the cut. For example, he identifies "symbolic patriotism", an emotional connection to the country triggered by the flag or the national anthem, as a shared value. What didn't make the cut was "blind patriotism", an "our country right or wrong" point of view. That type of patriotic fervor showed a wide variety of responses across the American spectrum, whereas the symbolic and emotional response to national icons was much more uniform and common.</p>

<p>The book is based on survey results that are in the publication process. More information about the survey and its surprising results are at <a href="http://www.OurValues.org">www.OurValues.org</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a container holding radioactive materials was reported to be leaking after it was dropped. Subsequent investigation showed that there was no contamination and there were no injuries reported.</p>

<p>Some sources</p>

<p><a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1193259-radioactive-scare-at-north-end-container-terminal">Chronicle Herald</a> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later, the Halifax Fire Department confirmed that four cylanders containing uranium hexafluoride fell from a container, but there was no leak of radioactive material. The fire department also said no one had been injured or contaminated as a result of the incident. Emergency officials were not expecting to have to evacuate anyone. It is believed the container was being loaded onto the deck of the Swedish-built Atlantic Companion when it dropped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier, there had been fears of elevated radiation levels, per this CBC News story.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/radioactive-leak-investigated-at-halifax-fairview-terminal-1.2572200">CBC News</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leak began when a container being loaded onto the deck of the Atlantic Companion dropped. The incident happened around 10 p.m. Thursday. The fire department went to test for radioactivity at the Ceres terminal. The first team found nothing, but a second test picked up higher than normal levels of radioactivity. The Atlantic Companion is a Swedish-built ship owned by Atlantic Container Line ACL.</p>
