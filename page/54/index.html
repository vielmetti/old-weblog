The convention isn't open to the public, but if you were to drop in, you'd find these people attending clinics on repairing, cleaning and restoring vacuums. You'd see them holding vacuuming contests, playing "Vacuum Jeopardy" and eating vacuum-shaped cake on tables decorated with vacuum components. Each was allowed to bring along 12 vacuums.

The logic runs like this. You place a series of bets, where if you lose you lose $1 and if you win you win $1000000.

        <p>Metblogs was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.
From Metblogs series finale:
[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-23-the-end-of-metblogs/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet.

What's the smallest piece of lego?
A eurobricks forum suggests it is a flower petal.
Lugnut says a gold coin, weighing in at just over 0.056 g; the flower petal is a hefty 0.064 g.
For reference, a 1x1 plate is 0.176 g and a 1x8 brick is 3.06 g.
