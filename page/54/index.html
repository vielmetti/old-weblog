<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Some notes, before I quit for the night, from the launch of <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> .</p><p>We went live at 8pm Thursday.&#0160; I took a nap after coming home from work, got up at about 830pm, and went online looking at the comments; most of that evening was spent answering comments, dealing with details, being helpful and present and attentive.&#0160; As much as possible, I tried to be like Caterina and George were like at the launch of Flickr.&#0160; (I wish I had a better quote for this; here&#39;s the one I could find from <a href="http://ptufts.blogspot.com/2006/04/caterina-fake-answers-questions-about.html">Pinhead&#39;s Progress</a> in 2006)</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">They wanted to make Flickr so that users were facing each other, instead of facing the website.<br /><br />To
encourage this, George Oates and Caterina spent almost <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> greeting
each person who came in to the original chat client when it launched.
They had an app called &quot;the newbie spotter&quot; which would tell them who
was new and what their interest was (you filled this in on your user
profile) so Caterina or George would then introduce them to other
users: &quot;I see you like &hellip; Black Metal. User GeorgM in Berlin also
likes Black Metal.&quot;<br /><br />Flickr is like a party with a good host.
Someone there to take your coat, get you a drink, and introduce you
around. By setting up this culture of meeting people, they made Flickr
a distinctive, friendly, and ultimately successful site.
<br /></div><p><br />Friday am up again at 7am, another round of comment moderation; in at work at 9am after dropping my little one at preschool.&#0160; Most of the morning spent in the comment stream looking at all of the little things people were eager to catch and point out at launch.&#0160; (Miami University, not University of Miami of Ohio; more than one typo; a few links that went to the wrong web sites; other similar sorts of detail that you&#39;d rather get right before people notice; <a href="http://flippedmovie.com">flippedmovie.com</a> is not the movie being filmed.)</p><p>When it was clear that things were not going to rattle apart and that there actually was something there that was starting to make sense, it got easier.&#0160; I sat out on the patio in front of the office, got my laptop out, and talked to some folks who came by.&#0160; <a href="http://www.scholar-warrior.info/">Cory Knobel</a> stopped by, and we talked about his PhD research and about complex systems in general and what sort of stories you are prepared to tell to make sense of things, especially when they break.&#0160; <a href="http://seekids.org/">Kathy Griswold</a> was also by to relate stories of clearing sight lines at sidewalk crossings and mid-block crosswalks, and the level of detail you need to be prepared to attend to to figure out just who owns which corner of which street and is responsible for maintenance.&#0160; I referred her to the <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/pubsdata.php">University of Michigan Transportation Research Library</a> for help in tracking down some of the publications she was having a hard time finding.</p><p>There were a welcome deluge of detailed, thoughtful comments on the site design and usability; as Cory noted, you will always have a usability evaluation, if only from the people who you want as your readers.&#0160; I&#39;ll be sorting through a bunch of that next week and helping capture feedback at enough detail that it can be turned into things that can change.</p><p>The big process failure so far is handling things from our &quot;community news&quot; section; some good stuff came in there, but I don&#39;t see that we are bird dogging it in the same way as we are comments.&#0160; Fixable but ultimately frustrating, especially when breaking news comes in and we are late to react.</p><p>The best commentary on the process comes from <a href="http://twitter.com/common_squirrel">@common_squirrel</a></p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115723259d8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 9" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115723259d8970b " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115723259d8970b-800wi" title="Picture 9" /></a> </p><br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The <a href="http://www.765.org/">Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society</a> brought Nickel Plate 765, a steam engine, through Ann Arbor on its way to Owosso for Trainfestival 2009.
</p>
<p>
Of the engine they write:
<blockquote>
This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I heard about the trip on Twitter, and followed the handful of railfans, the curious, and trainspotters who were chasing it as it headed up the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks. You can follow the engine there as <a href="http://twitter.com/nickelplate765">@nickelplate765</a>.  I managed to get close enough to hear the whistle blow, and very much enjoyed this video captured by <a href="http://twitter.com/chris_goosman">Chris Goosman</a>.  If I read this right it should be heading back down through Ann Arbor from Owosso on its return trip - look for it!
</p>
<blockquote>
As part of this year’s largest celebration in railroading, no. 765 will operate a special excursion from Owosso to Alma, Michigan and return on July 26th. From July 23rd to July 25th, the locomotive will be on live steam display with eight other steam locomotives from around the country!

      <p>I&#39;ve been collecting data on parking prices for Michigan football games in yards near the stadium for a couple of years now; the better the team is doing, the better the chance that the $20 parking turns into $25 parking, or $15 turns into $20.&#0160; </p><p>The one data point I have for Art Fair parking pricing for 2009 is that a lot near the new office is offering $15 parking, in a location that in previous years had fetched $20.</p>

      <p>Another copy of the Ann Arbor Gerbil showed up on my sidewalk this morning. &#0160;It&#39;s nice to have a morning paper, much nicer than the mid-afternoon Ann Arbor Snooze that used to never arrive quite early enough to read over lunch, and by the time it got to be after dinner to read it it was most of a day old.</p><div><br />Some of last week&#39;s Gerbils that were left on lawns unread decayed enough to leave crumbs of newspaper on the lawns of apartment buildings on Packard, no worse so far than the occasional decaying NY Times or Wall St Journals that sometimes pile up in front of student rentals unread.</div><br /><div>There was a little bit of news in it this time - a few words with one of the new school board members who got elected after unsuccessfully withdrawing from the election, and a profile of one of the new vendors at Farmer&#39;s Market. &#0160; It seemed like mostly ads, though I didn&#39;t cut it up and weigh it to show that. &#0160;The first glance at the obits looked like it was mostly Chelsea names there.</div><br /><div>Still no RSS feed for the web site, so you have to count on the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115711c3f8e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115711c3f8e970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115711c3f8e970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> icon to guide your way.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">The library created a book drop for every tag. To see pictures of their setup, go here. But for simplicity&#039;s sake, imagine a library that does this for just one tag, say, amazing books. When you return books to the library, you’d have a choice: drop it in the regular book drop or the book drop for amazing books. Then, the library staff would take the books in the “amazing” book drop and put them on the shelf called “Books other patrons recommend.” The librarians could also scan those books and add the “amazing” tag to them so that it is captured in the collection database.</div>

<p>Tags identifying the author, publisher and other information — as well as any usage restrictions publishers hope to place on copyright-protected materials — would be packaged with each news article in a way that search engines can more easily identify.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">After lauding the journalistic might of the Plain Dealer&#039;s newsroom with a staff of 240, Didiun goes on to dismiss the the blogsphere, where Schultz has been taking a lot of heat from the likes of BuzzMachine&#039;s Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#039;s really a bunch of pipsqueaks out there talking about what the real journalists do,&quot; Didiun says. It sure sounds like the Plain Dealer&#039;s &quot;reader rep&quot; thinks that his paper&#039;s readers need to be protected from what the blogosphere has to say about what&#039;s being published in his newspaper.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">At the recent Real-Time CrunchUp 2009, Khris Loux, CEO of one of the web&#039;s largest commenting services, announced the
&quot;death of the comment&quot;. This declaration was extremely significant as Loux&#039;s JS-Kit is currently installed on over 600,000 sites. He blames the death on social media sites like Twitter and Flickr and the rise of &quot;parallel channels away from [the] product&quot;. In essence, dialogue has moved from a singular destination to a series of parallel but separate social networking channels.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">If public-records requests are expensive, the Palin administration’s practices help make them so, says Gregg Erickson, a Juneau economist and former state revenue official who publishes a specialized newsletter on Alaska budget issues.</p>

<p>“They have taken the position that a lawyer has to look at every single record before its release. If a lawyer has to look at it and review it, and maybe write a legal opinion on it, well, that’s going to be expensive,” says Mr. Erickson. Court fights also add to the costs, he says.</p>

<p>Citizens and journalists who sought public records have been socked with huge bills. At one point, the Palin administration presented the Associated Press with a bill of $45 million for copies of official state e-mails sent to Palin’s husband, to the McCain campaign, and to federal agencies.</div><br />

<p>It&#039;s just such a stunning example of newspaper-industry hubris and cluelessness. True confession: I&#039;m writing about it for the second time, and I still haven&#039;t made it past the 10-minute mark, where Cleveland Plain Dealer &quot;reader representative&quot; Ted Diadiun refers to bloggers as &quot;a bunch of pipsqueaks.&quot;</div><br />

      <p>day 9 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>A new newspaper showed up on my sidewalk yesterday afternoon; I&#39;m not going to name it by name, but let&#39;s just call it the A2 Gerbil.&#0160; It was a happy little paper, full of happy little stories about quaint things happening in some leafy town somewhere near here.&#0160; It took me a couple of minutes to leaf through it and a few more minutes to hunt down the web site for it and appreciate some of its finer points.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I&#39;d pick on the newspaper itself, but you can&#39;t see it unless you live here.&#0160; Like its namesake, it leaves droppings on sidewalks, and if you walk through my neighborhood you&#39;ll notice in a few blocks half a dozen houses that didn&#39;t bother to pick it up, and if you walk down Packard you&#39;ll notice that most houses didn&#39;t manage to pick it up.&#0160; Unsolicited free drop media of all kinds generates litter - in student neighborhoods you perpetually step over rotting copies of the Wall Street Journal delivered but unread.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>There were the usual collection of small town newspaper typoes - spelling mistakes in the body copy, and one I noticed in a headline.&#0160; People make mistakes, but if you&#39;re going to the trouble of printing them, you&#39;d hope there were enough people in the production process and enough spell checking tools to catch them.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>The web site is a charming example of what newspaper web sites looked before RSS feeds made it possible to syndicate news and read it (minus the ads) in a feed reader.&#0160; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a deliberate, calculated design decision, or an omission.&#0160; The one indication that you have that a story is new is a blinking NEW! icon.&#0160; (really)</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>Some of the headlines on the web site could use some work.&#0160; &quot;Construction under way&quot;; that&#39;s not helpful.&#0160; &quot;Ann Arbor&#39;s many distinctions&quot;; that could run every week.&#0160; &quot;Neighbors get their way&quot;; a hint of controversy, I suppose, but again that looks like an every issue column and not really a headline.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>It&#39;s tough being a photo editor, but really, when you print pictures of people in a parade, it would be really nice to get their names, so that you could say who they were so that someone could clip and send the photo to them.&#0160; It just looks weird to see a caption like &quot;Someone is walking in a parade&quot; with no idea who it is.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I hate to poke at someone&#39;s new enterprise, in part because I&#39;m involved in a new enterprise, and it might have some aspects of it in the first issue that aren&#39;t 100% glorious.&#0160; I&#39;m sure that the Gerbil, and its owners at the esteemed Gerbil-Hamster Corporation, is the product of a lot of hard work.&#0160; Alas, it doesn&#39;t say anything about the town I live in - it&#39;s like a picture-perfect mirror to some sleepy parallel universe town where everything is kind of nice in a boring kind of way.&#0160; </p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Though I&#039;m not entirely opposed to this style—witness this very post—most of the blog&#039;s popularity derives from columns titled things like &quot;Teeth and Blood&quot; and &quot;You Were Killed By A Bear And I Am Sad&quot; and 5000-word exegeses on half of a Michigan football game, which are neither search engine- or link-friendly. With some limited exceptions (like throwing the name of each committed recruit into the post title, and providing SEO-friendly headlines for actual news posts) my philosophy has been to make the content as good, and as difficult to replicate, as possible. (Evidently I feel a good, weird title goes a long way.) The cookie cutter is eschewed.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">But some of the most valuable scientific meetings are more focused and deliberative, and are by invitation only. These intellectually intimate gatherings are valuable precisely because the researchers who attend feel free to speculate and to stimulate their colleagues, and to try to establish new research agendas. Whether an attendee is a blogger or a reporter or a practising researcher is immaterial. The meeting is &#039;off the record&#039;, and all have to sign up to that.</p>

<p>Closed or open? Meeting organizers need to be clear in their minds which of these two approaches is appropriate, and be explicit about it from start to finish. The consequence that, in competitive fields, presentations at open meetings will become even more protective and boring is an inevitable consequence of the Internet.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">If you&#039;re going to be &quot;hyperlocal,&quot; that is not what blogs look like. Some of my favorite blogs are anonymous, others are attached to real people&#039;s names, but they generally: share information; aggregate information; analyze information. And the best do all three, but they are not generally breaking news. [Take a look at some of the blogs that will be on the parenting section of Ann Arbor.com; they are well-written and interesting, but they are not news breaking.] In addition, although some of the most credible bloggers I know do use their real names, others don&#039;t. They seem credible to me because their voice comes through (yes, as in &quot;writing voice&quot;), they provide thoughtful analysis, they cite verifiable sources.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">A lot of people wondered how Google would ever make any money with a search engine. That problem was obviously solved. In any community with vast numbers of highly energetic and passionate users, there will be a variety of ways to make money. The only thing that can stop these services are high costs (YouTube and Facebook suffer from this) or someone building a better mousetrap (Facebook did this to MySpace who did this to Friendster).</p>

<p>By the way, News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch isn’t impressed, either, saying that the site is “a tough investment to justify because it has not yet come up with a sustainable way to make money.” He also gave the exact wrong answer to two questions: “Asked if he was considering buying Twitter, Murdoch said, “No.” Asked about selling MySpace, he said, “Hell no.”&quot;</div><br />

      <p>day 8 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>Almost every week for the last 4 years I&#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers.&#0160; Repetition makes it a bit easier.</p><p>Most weeks I try, or at least intend to try, to put together some notes about lunch.&#0160; Now that I&#39;m no longer just an experienced blogger but also a fledgling analog journalist, I took some notes; these are incomplete, but they are more complete than I normally do.&#0160; I&#39;m hoping to get better at note-taking as time goes on.&#0160; </p><p>People go around the table and introduce themselves; I asked people to say a few words about what&#39;s going on for them.&#0160; This list below links in most cases to people&#39;s or organizations Arborwiki pages, since that lets me edit and fill in some of the blanks later or to have some of the blanks already filled in.</p><p>In order of how I wrote them down, with a simple question: what did you notice this week?&#0160; Apologies if I got anything wrong or incomplete, and I know there are incomplete bits here.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Patricia_Anderson">Patricia Anderson</a> - U of Michigan emerging technologies librarian - talked about some meetings she was at with folks at the U looking at getting UM communications people engaged in social media; the good story was about introducing people for the first time to SlideShare.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Linda_Diane_Feldt">Linda Diane Feldt</a> - holistic health practitioner - spoke about foraging, and teaching people about where to find black raspberries and wondering why more people weren&#39;t out picking them.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/David_C._Bloom">David C.

                <div class="delicious-extended">Not hilarious. It makes sense. Over 90% of Politico’s revenue comes from its print edition, even though it’s only distributed in D.C. The truth is, as the CFOs of both the NYTimes and WSJ will tell you, print advertising, on a CPM basis, generates 75x more revenue than Web ads.

                <div class="delicious-extended">In the past several weeks, I’ve been playing with a new format that my friends at TopTenSources developed. We’ve seen the Citizen Journalist; this idea is the Citizen Editor. Several of us have been using a new bookmarklet-style tool that makes it very easy to tag a story when you’re reading it, provide a bit of analysis, and have it posted to a dedicated website on the topic. It’s in many ways what lots of bloggers do anyway. I remember Dave Winer showing me an aspect of Manila that renders a river of news and then lets you check off stories that you want to appear somewhere — dead simple and fun; this idea is in the same vein, only using different tools and with a different output.</div>

<p>Today, the Internet has brought countless communities of interest together. Some of them blog and some of them chat among themselves. They can connect with each other — and with us — using only a few keystrokes and the “send” button.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">United has demonstrated they know how to keep their airline in the forefront of their customer’s minds and I wanted this project to expand upon that satirically. I’ve been done “being angry” for quite some time and, if anything, I should thank United. They’ve given me a creative outlet that has brought people together from around the world. We had a pile of laughs making the recording and the video while the images are spinning on how to make “United: Song 2” even better than the first. So, thanks United! If my guitar had to be smashed due to extreme negligence I’m glad it was you that did it. Now sit back and enjoy the show.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">The kind of people who are affected by The Ann Arbor News becoming annarbor.com are generally less hardcore about their sports coverage.</p>

<p>But with the transition to the web, they are promising to link out a lot, so having more of a two-way relationship with the local news sites would help, probably just in terms of Google ranking and maybe some traffic. Right now I link to them and The Free Press fairly often, and I don’t think I’ve ever received a link from any of those sources. That seems a little unbalanced.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>day 7 of a continuing series documenting my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>There&#39;s a wonderful weekly program on KCRW in Santa Monica called <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/gf">Good Food</a>.&#0160; Host Evan Kleiman does a roundup of reporting from the restaurants and farmers markets around Los Angeles, with interviews with restaurant owners, talks with farmers at markets about the produce they are bringing to market this week, and feature stories about restaurant excursions into the many cuisines that make up LA.&#0160; It&#39;s a very fun show, and especially when it&#39;s the middle of an Ann Arbor winter there&#39;s something sunny and cheery about hearing that something is in season somewhere. </p><p>I went to the Wednesday market at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Farmers_Market">Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a> today.&#0160; It&#39;s about six blocks from the office, and for a number of years I&#39;ve been a regular there, either at the Wednesday or the Saturday market.&#0160; I came with pencil and pad of paper in hand and no shopping basket and walked around looking at what was there, and what caught my eye was berries - lots of berries - really, the high season of the berry season.&#0160; So to provide a proper catalog, here&#39;s what&#39;s in season at market this week:</p><ul>
<li>Strawberries.&#0160; Nearing the end of the season.</li>
<li>Blueberries.&#0160; Just starting the season.</li>
<li>Gooseberries, red and green.&#0160; One vendor, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem%27s">Wasem&#39;s</a>.</li>
<li>Currants, red and black, also both at Wasem&#39;s.</li>
<li>Blackberries.</li>
<li>Mulberries.&#0160; I was surprised to see them, because I think of them as street tree food, but they were there.</li>
<li>Red Raspberries, both conventional and organic.</li>
<li>Cherries, sweet, sour, and Queen Anne.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken a taste to the sour cherries - more flavor and less sweet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might have missed black raspberries; they are ripe in bushes around town, including at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wheeler_Park">Wheeler Park</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wurster_Park">Wurster Park</a>.&#0160; The juneberry / serviceberry season is either over or just about over depending on the tree you go to.&#0160;&#0160; <a href="http://arborwiki/city/Molly_Notarianni">Molly Notarianni</a>, the market manager, says she saw wild gooseberries along a path around <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Pickerel_Lake">Pickerel Lake</a>, near the stone fireplaces.</p>
