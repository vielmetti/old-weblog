<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>This is the AAATA Route 5 summer 2015 inbound to Ann Arbor schedule, as it looks as embedded with ViewerJS. </p>

<p>I note on Chrome on Mac OS X that the map is white on black instead of the black on white that I see in Preview.</p>

<p>Report is that this looks like a grey box on an iPhone.</p>

<p>I note that on Windows Phone 8.1 it loads slowly and the fonts are very blocky, and the map is a somewhat legible black on white.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it's running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it's also quite economical.</p>

<p>That said, there's one feature on the phone that wasn't a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him. The phone has wifi calling so it should have worked just fine where I was, a spot that has poor cell reception. But the call never came, and by the time I idly checked my messages I had missed several calls. How did that happen?</p>

<p>Windows Phone and Cortana has a feature called Quiet Hours. In <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-quiet-hours-and-inner-circles-windows-phone-81">How to set up Quiet Hours and Inner Circles on Windows Phone 8.1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsabri">Sam Sabri</a> writes for Windows Central a nice tutorial on how to set it up and configure the phone to not ring during some hours of the day and to allow some people to specially ring the phone even when it's set to no ring. It's a good tutorial, and if I had read it carefully and thought it through I could have set it up to always take calls from important people late at night.</p>

<p>The truth is, though, that I already have another phone system (Google Voice) that I could already use to reroute or divert calls, and having that power in my phone though nice is the opposite of what I wanted. If it's late and someone calls me, I want to take the call. So my suggestion to you for your new Windows Phone is - if you want to use it as a phone - that you start out your device setup by disabling Quiet Hours, and only add it back in once you have thought it through very carefully.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, May 5, 2015, 2:00 a.m. I spoke with Jim Payeur, fire chief for the Chelsea Area Fire Authority, about the gas pipeline explosion in a 20" gas transmission line in a wooded area near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road about five miles north of Chelsea, Michigan. The incident occurred at about 10:30 p.m. on May 4, when about 20 people reported a sound like a jet crash. There was no fire at the scene and no injuries reported. Some nearby residents were evacuated from their homes and sheltered at Lyndon Township Hall. Chief Payeur had "no clue" why the pipeline ruptured, and said that a crew from Consumers Energy was working on site. The scene has been cleared and residents have been allowed to return to their homes.</p>

<p>This is my final update for tonight.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:29 a.m. Called Huron Valley Ambulance (fire dispatch), was told that they were "not allowed to give out any information". The below map is from PHMSA and shows the routes of gas pipelines in the area.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:10 a.m. First hand account says they told people with a half mile to leave. Report that the fire could be heard from three miles away. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>Ann Arbor, MI, May 5, 2015, 12:37 a.m. Reports of a fire in a 20 inch gas main in Lyndon Township north of Chelsea, MI near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language. Learning a new language from scratch is not the easy task, but with news reports you're not really trying to learn the language at all, just to read the text like a "bookbreaker" would read it if they were <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/How_the_Germans.pdf">decoding a secret code</a>.</p>

<p>So, Nepali news, sad all of it. Lots of photos are online, some video. Active message traffic via amateur radio is on 20 meters, which you can monitor at a <a href="http://websdr.org">WebSDR</a> station. Trying to find a good DX monitoring spot for Nepali transmissions.</p>

<p>The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I'm looking at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn't have school and so I didn't actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.</p>

<p>The first piece of the new routine is getting to the <a href="http://www.annarborymca.org/">Ann Arbor YMCA</a>. If the weather is nice and I don't have anything else going on, it's a nice bike ride; if I'm making a car trip into town for school, it's close enough to be a good next stop. The only slight problem with the Y during the day is parking, not that I'd spend money on parking, but that everyone knows to park on West Washington St. There's nothing quite like a sauna in the morning to get you going, and there's a lovely little library by the pool with a very fast wifi and good power outlets.</p>

<p>The second piece of the new routine is <a href="http://www.argusfarmstop.com/">Argus Farm Stop</a>. I had been in here when it first opened, but now the routine has settled down a bit, and after the 8:00 a.m - 9:00 a.m. coffee rush it's a pretty reasonable spot to sit and type. There's delicious day-old bread to be had at reasonable prices and they will lop off an end for you to chew on while you drink your coffee. As a bonus the parking on Second St usually has a free space on one side or another at 8:00 a.m. so I can walk to the Y, do my thing, walk back, sit for a bit and type some more, and be good to go by 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>The conversation at the Farm Stop is sparkling - talked to a fellow named Granger who's moving here from Colorado about food, where to get a good bi bim bap, and his plans with his friends to open up a glass shop in town. 
<span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Kathy Sample</span>
was behind the counter sorting out the morning flow and talking about the farmers bringing in their produce and their meats.</p>

<p>Between those two changes I now can pretty much count on being bathed, fed, watered, and have a little bit of shopping done by 10:00 a.m. If the weather is nice, I get a bike ride in to start the day, and I haven't spent any pennies on parking, and it also works to take the bus.</p>

      <p>After three or four years of planning to get Skywarn training, this year I finally did it. The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.</p>

<p>I was there with John Hritz KD8MKE and Ann Hanson. Ann captured the opening slide. There was a nifty online multiplayer game (can't recall the site it was built on) which had 95 people playing along from their smart phones!</p>

<p>My spotter ID good for 2 years is 242.</p>

<p>I brought my radio to the event and made a contact from the car with Marty KD8RGL from Canton MI. We were both using 5 watt radios contacting the W8UM repeater in Ann Arbor - I'm always surprised how well things work when they do work.</p>

<p>I discovered that it works a lot better to identify myself as "Eddie" when on the air. This because "Ed" gets misinterpreted as "Andy" all too often, and "Edward" seems awfully formal.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b img-responsive" style="width: 490px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 11.35.53 AM" title="Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 11.35.53 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b-500wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.</p>

<p>After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. Same form factor, bright blue in color, and the supplied antenna is a retractable whip with a magnetic base. As always it comes with no documentation and no software (you are expected to provide those).</p>

<p>I had previously used a version of "gqrx" as a radio receiver, in a package that had been built for the Mac. This time I thought I'd build from source. I went to the 'homebrew' port system and found a version that said it worked for OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), but I'm on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and the build didn't work (it crapped out in building scipy). Reading the documentation more closely the distribution says it's available through Macports, so I installed that and did "sudo port install gnuradio" and "sudo port install gqrx".</p>

<p>Macports is one of those amazing feats of modern software engineering where someone (or really a lot of people) have carefully and meticulously figured out how to take a package of source code and make it build, including tracing all of the dependencies upon which everything else needs to be built. For gqrx and GNU Radio this means (at the very bottom) that I had to have a working FORTRAN compiler so that I could compile the FORTRAN code hiding in the numerical analysis libraries. This brings me right back to the 1970s learning FORTRAN at Michigan Tech in their Summer Youth Program. I can't even imagine how old the code was that I compiled but it might actually date from then.</p>

<p>Everything did build just fine, and then I had a radio. The first test is always to tune into WCBN, which came in with a strong signal, and to key up my ham radio transmitter via Echolink to make the W8UM repeater make some noise, and to get some weather radio going. Everything I tried worked just fine and passed with flying colors, the gqrx software is more modern than it once was in a couple of very helpful ways.</p>

<p>Next was to grab one of the many versions of "dump1090" which uses the SDR radio to tune to aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that give you a version of aircraft radar. This also worked well, perhaps better than I could have expected. From home with an antenna in the middle of the house I could hear airplanes just north of Jackson, MI from Ann Arbor, MI (about 40 miles). I relocated to a cafe near the dog park (Ellsworth at Platt) that has a good view of the southern sky, and the same little bitty antenna pulled in reception from airplanes near Fort Wayne, IN (about 120 miles). </p>

<p>There's always more to try, of course. GNU Radio is a full toolkit for building your own radio design, complete with FM decoders and the like, and it has a fairly simple to understand user interface compared to how complex the underpinnings are (remember, FORTRAN). There's lots more software that uses the RTL-SDR libraries and even a port to the Raspberry Pi which I'd like to try.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My Twitter feed was full of air crash news this morning. Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all passengers aboard. Wikipedia has a <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Germanwings_Flight_9525">good summary</a>, perhaps as good as any.</p>

<p>What was unusual about the crash was that there was no distress call, and that the plane descended rapidly and steadily into the ground without veering once from its course.</p>

<p>Of note in this regard is another European flight on a similar aircraft some months earlier. Lufthansa 1829 on Nov 5th 2014 lost 4000 feet/minute of altitude after having problems with its control systems. The <a href="http://avherald.com/h?article=47d74074">Aviation Herald story</a> was written a few days later, and it references emergency airworthiness directive <a href="http://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/easa_ad_2014_0266_E.pdf/EAD_2014-0266-E_1">2014-0266-E_1 (pdf)</a>. <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=171411">AviationSafety.net has a summary of that incident</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During climb, 12 NM NW of Pamplona, at approximately Flight Level 310, the aircraft unexpectedly decreased the pitch autonomous and started to descend. The aircraft reached a rate of descent of up to 4,000 ft/min. The crew was able to stop the descent at Flight Level 270. The flight was continued and the aircraft landed safely at its destination Munich Airport. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least superficially the incidents seem related. I am not expert enough at aviation issues to know if there is a real connection, or if this is mere coincidence.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman's Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones.</p>

<p>The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map.</p>

<p>As always with these discussions the question turned to what data there might be available to look at, and how to get it. That led us to questions of what other people were doing with municipal data in other cities, and to this New York City parking ticket analysis: <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/87573867759/success-how-nyc-open-data-and-reddit-saved-new">Success: How NYC Open Data and Reddit Saved New Yorkers Over $55,000 a Year</a>. It seems that there was a parking space in New York that looked like it was a legal spot, but turned out to be frequently ticketed because it was near a fire hydrant. After some analysis and publicity by Ben Wellington of I Quant NY, the NYC DOT repainted the stripes on the street to clearly mark this spot as a no-go.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, how would you repeat this analysis for Ann Arbor, and what would you look for? Where are there locations that frequently generate tickets, what do they look like on a map, and how much ticket revenue comes per space?  And in the public interest, are there any spots that generate disproportionate ticket frequencies that should be looked at carefully to improve signage?</p>

<p>It looks like a project. In New York there's a data catalog that includes this data set and many others; no such data has been released in Ann Arbor. So the first step is understanding what the process is for getting a year or two of ticket data to start analyzing it.</p>

<p>Update: here's a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_wellington_how_we_found_the_worst_place_to_park_in_new_york_city_using_big_data?language=en">TED Talk by Ben Wellington</a> on "How we found the worst place to park in New York City -- using big data".</p>

<p>I'll price out fixing the Nexus 4, but I suspect it's not going to be worth repairing. (We'll see.) And then there's the question of what kind of device do you want to carry around with you all the time, how much you want to spend and whether it makes sense to retreat to simpler technology for a while until the answer is more clear.</p>

<p>I first got word that there was a chance of northern lights from the <a href="http://mivus.org/">Michigan VHF-UHF Society mailing list</a>, an amateur radio group. When the aurora activity is high, the VHF amateur radio bands (2 meter and 6 meter) get increased range, so ham radio operators with this interest keep an alert out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/">The Aurora Page at Michigan Tech</a> has a lot of useful links to space weather forecasts.</p>

<p>Alas no sign of or reports of northern lights in Ann Arbor - we don't exactly have a dark sky, but the storm was also not strong enough for any reports this far south.</p>
