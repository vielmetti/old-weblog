<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>There's lots of Reddy Kilowatt information and memorabilia on <a href="http://www.reddykilowatt.org/">ReddyKilowatt.org</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a completely unofficial web site dedicated to Reddy Kilowatt. It features history, memorabilia, items for sale and more. Please note that I can’t/don’t/won’t estimate the value of any of your Reddy collectibles. Seriously. Ever. Try looking at the going price at eBay or at other antique dealers if you want to find out how much any particular Reddy Kilowatt item might be worth. More about Reddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From here I found the <a href="http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!265798!0">Reddy Kilowatt Records, 1926-1999, Archives Center, National Museum of American History.</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Reddy Kilowatt trademark was created in 1926 by Ashton B. Collins. Reddy Kilowatt, Inc. licensed the trademark promotion and identification purposes by more than 150 investor-owned electric utilities in the United States and at least 12 foreign countries. The company later changed its name to Reddy Communications, Inc. In 1998 Northern States Power Company bought Reddy Communications and its assets, later changing its name to Xcel Energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More on Ashton B. Collins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Administrative/Biographical History: Ashton B. Collins, Sr. (1885-1976), the commercial manager of Alabama Power Company, created the trademark character Reddy Kilowatt in 1926 in an attempt to humanize electric utility service for marketing and other corporate communications purposes. Reddy Kilowatt first appeared publicly at the 1926 Alabama Electrical Exposition in a display for the Alabama Power Company, which also ran supporting newspaper advertisements. The original figure had five arms to illustrate the many capabilities of electric service. Though Collins originated the idea of Reddy Kilowatt, he asked an engineer from the company’s drafting department, Dan Clinton, to create a usable sketch of the character. After the exposition, Collins retained the copyrights to Reddy Kilowatt. In 1932, he recruited a friend, Dorothea Warren, to develop several sketches of Reddy Kilowatt in an attempt to sell what Collins called “The Reddy Kilowatt Program.” At the time, Collins was employed by Edison Electrical Institute to travel the country promoting electrical household cooking appliances. He used the opportunity to network with electric utility managers and to promote his idea of using Reddy Kilowatt to humanize electric service in the home. Collins convinced his first clients in 1933. By the end of 1934, at least six other electric utility companies had adopted the “Reddy Kilowatt Program.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Noted as an example of "how do they do that"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.kinectrics.com/Solutions/Pages/real-time-digital-simulator-rtds.aspx">Kinetrics</a> has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. The vendor of the software is <a href="https://www.rtds.com/">RTDS Technologies</a> which describes it also thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are the pioneer and exclusive supplier of this custom hardware and software, which is specifically designed to perform real time electromagnetic transient simulations.</p>
  
  <p>The Simulator operates continuously in real time while providing accurate results over a frequency range from DC to kilohertz range. It is used for closed loop testing of protective relay and control systems, power hardware in the loop studies, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www4vip.inl.gov/research/real-time-digital-simulator/">Idaho National Laboratory has one of these simulators</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system’s graphical user interface, proprietary software and mathematical algorithms can simulate any modern electric power grid configuration. As new equipment or components are added or subtracted from the simulator’s configuration, the model instantly updates. For example, INL researchers can run simulated system–failure scenarios such as a control system cyber intrusion or a physical damage event such as a terrorist attack or natural disaster and instantly detect the order and reasoning for why dedicated relays, breakers or substations failed.</p>
  
  <p>The ability to simulate real–time power grid information is a key factor in detecting previously unknown vulnerabilities and providing emergency planners with a path forward for responding to grid failures. The RTDS Simulator enables power industry experts to define the network configuration and run real time tests for many aspects of service life allowing system problems to be discovered faster, and solutions to be designed and tested immediately.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don't have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you're expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively.</p>

<p>I'm making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python.  Some notes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Download and install Firefox</a> if you don't already have it installed, from mozilla.org.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Download and install the Selenium IDE</a> for Firefox, which lets you interactively create Selenium scripts within Firefox.</p></li>
<li><p>From the command line, <code>pip install selenium</code> to get the package of Python drivers for Selenium.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're also using Google Chrome, you'll want <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">ChromeDriver</a> to get Selenium to talk to Chrome.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With this all you have enough of the tools to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Udemy has a <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/selenium-ide-tutorial/">Selenium IDE tutorial</a> to walk through to get you started, as a prelude to their for-pay course on the same topic. Guru99 also has a <a href="http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html">free Selenium tutorial</a> that covers the Selenium IDE. </p>

<p><a href="http://scraping.pro/selenium-ide-and-web-scraping/">A very nice overview of the process</a> from scraping.pro gives you some insight into what's really going on. The workflow is to create interactive scripts from within Firefox, then export them to Python and run them through a driver that drives multiple browsers. You can tweak lots of details in the Python script and incorporate those into some bigger applications.</p>

<p>Best bet though is to find someone who knows it and watch over their shoulder and ask questions!</p>

<p>A brief note on two pages I refer to during severe weather, like the storms that rolled through the area on Monday night and Tuesday early morning that led to <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/June_2015_Manchester_tornado">tornado damage in Manchester</a> on the morning of June 23, 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lightningmaps.org/">LightningMaps.org</a> has a zoomable near real time map of lightning strikes. You can zoom and pan around looking at locations of lightning strikes, with a small (less than 10 seconds) delay. When everything lines up right you can see the lightning strike on your computer before you hear the thunder.</p>

<p>The LightningMaps data comes from the <a href="http://www.blitzortung.org">BlitzOrtung</a> project, which has deployed a set of custom designed lightning detectors world wide. From their page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Blitzortung.org" is a lightning detection network for the location of electromagnetic discharges in the atmosphere (lightning discharges) based on the time of arrival (TOA) and time of group arrival (TOGA) method. It consists of several lightning receivers and one central processing server. The stations transmit their data in short time intervals over the Internet to our server. Every data sentence contains the precise time of arrival of the received lightning discharge impulse ("sferic") and the exact geographic position of the receiver. With this information from all stations the exact positions of the discharges are computed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blitzortung is working on a new generation of lightning detectors, which are not yet available, and they are no longer manufacturing their first generation of detectors. Even so the US coverage of lightning detection is very good and recommended for storm tracking. The project lead is Egon Wanke of Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">Using GNU Parallel to speed up network operations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough.</p>

<p>Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. If you are working on something where it doesn't matter which order things happen in as long as they all get done you are in good shape to get tremendous performance improvements simply by overlapping operations.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>DTE Energy does not have one single page on their web site that shows you the total number of outages across their system - or if they do have it, it's so well hidden that I haven't found it. What they do have is a way to fetch the outage count for a single ZIP code. So, armed with a set of zip codes, you can determine a total. You don't care which ZIP is fetched first but you do want them all to show up before you add them up.</p>

<p>The one-line command I have for this is</p>

<p><code>
parallel -P 32 -a ~/data/dte-zips ~/bin/dte-by-zip | jq -s add
</code></p>

<p>The script dte-by-zip runs as follows, fetching a page from a DTE server and parsing it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ dte-by-zip 48104</p>
  
  <p>38</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thus the parallel invocation reads roughly as follows: "for 32 parallel threads, using the dte-zips data file one line a time as command line arguments, run dte-by-zip; add up all the results".</p>

<p>Note that if you are using "curl" to fetch pages, you want to be aware of the <code>--max-time</code> option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-m, --max-time <seconds>
               Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to
               take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
               ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you don't want to go too crazy with parallel operations on network resources, it's possible to overrun a remote server and it might be faster to pull 8 or 16 parallel threads instead of 32 or 64 depending on the nature of the remote machine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/">runC</a>. It's a "lightweight universal plumbing" that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of Docker's start on Linux systems, it's been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. Some tries to make it work depend on setting up virtual machines (with the likes of boot2docker) which makes it work at the cost of performance and flexibility. Docker on OS X has not been exceptionally easy though it does work once you commit to doing all of your Docker server work inside a VM</p>

<p>runC would be an answer to the problem of native Docker on OSX X, one might hope, but as of its first release it doesn't work. The first of what is probably many hurdles is the extensive use of the clone(2) system call instead of fork(2). This <a href="http://files.meetup.com/10602292/See%20Docker%20from%20the%20Perspective%20of%20Linux%20Process.pdf">presentation from Allen Sun at DaoCloud</a> goes into the details of Docker's use of clone(2) from the perspective of Linux processes. It is notable that the OS X "Darwin" kernel doesn't have clone(2), and it's as far as I can tell not readily possible to mimic all of clone's semantics strictly by using fork in clever ways.</p>

<p>An open issue on Github is tracking <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/9">Build fails on Mac OS X 10.9</a>. I don't see an easy fix without work by Apple on their kernel.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I attended this week's meeting of the Governance Committee of the Ann Arbor Board of Education, and this is what I saw.</p>

<p>Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting.</p>

<p>One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online. It had several typoes and missspellings, including an incorrect reference to statute.</p>

<p>A last agenda item (FOIA) had a completely incorrect document posted online, which caused measurable confusion at the meeting as trustees were reviewing a document which was not actually the one that they were asked to review. </p>

<p>I believe that these routine postings of documents from staff to the board are the responsibility of district staff, and that the board secretary is the particular person tasked with getting documents online in a timely manner. I have no idea how well Board Docs works but if it's anything like the city's Legistar system it's probably difficult to use enterprise software. Nevertheless, it's the responsibility of the board and of the executive staff to produce these records in a timely manner to prepare not just the public but <em>also the board</em> for their meetings, and this situation deserves attention to see if there's scheduling or training or other management effort to ensure that Board Docs is always up to date as a matter of good policy and practice.</p>

<p>(Also, Balas has the best welcome signs.)</p>

<p>Plus: fun to ride, big front basket. It's a very nice bike that you're riding, with a good 3 speed shifter and a very sturdy construction. </p>

<p>Minus: no lights, no bell, no helmets. More specifically, I am told that the lights come on automatically, and that there is a bell somewhere, but I didn't find it and it wasn't labeled. I did have a helmet with me so I wore that.</p>

      <p>Why is 410 Miller still standing, after the Building Board of Appeals issued an order for it to be demolished? In part, because the Notice and Order to demolish was never sent. From FOIA 15-210:</p>

<p>Further it is stated that the hearing at which the decision to demolish was made was recorded, yet a transcription of the hearing was not made available on account of the audio being illegible:</p>

<p>DRAFT POLICY 5060 - STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS</p>

<p>The Board of Education believes that assessing student progress provides important data by which the district can measure the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction and the impact of our educational programs on student achievement.  Participation in assessment programs by all students ensures accurate information is provided to parents, educators and other stakeholders and is necessary to improve educational outcomes for our students.</p>

<p>Draft Amended Policy 5060</p>

<p>The Board of Education believes that assessing student progress provides important data by which the district can measure the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction and the impact of our educational programs on student achievement.  Participation in assessment programs by all students ensures accurate information is provided to parents, educators and other stakeholders and is necessary to improve educational outcomes for our students.</p>

<p>All students enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools are required to participate in any and all assessments mandated by State and Federal law.  Therefore, full participation in these required assessments is mandatory for all students who are enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools.   There is no mechanism or policy that allows for districts, or their students, to “opt out” of mandated state or federal assessments.  Failure by the district to test the required number of students in each school and/or district-wide may result in educational, financial or reporting sanctions or other negative consequences, and could lead to changes in district policies or procedures to ensure adequate and/or uniform participation.</p>

<p>The Superintendent or designee shall administer student assessments in content areas and grade levels as required by state and federal laws, and shall work with district administrators, principals and the parent and student community to ensure adequate education about and participation in state and federal mandated testing .    Failure  to participate in all state and federal assessments will result in the Board taking any additional actions deemed appropriate to protect the district. Therefore, full participation in state assessments is mandatory for all students who are enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools.  Failure to participate in all state assessments may result in exclusion and/or removal from any application-based school or program.  Special exceptions to individual student participation may be granted by the Superintendent or designee upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular updates of student progress to students, parents, educators and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><a href="http://boozedandinfused.com/2012/05/30/a-tale-of-two-rhubarbs-and-some-gin/">Boozed and Infused</a> has two recipes, one for Rhubarb Gin and one for Rhubarb Orange Gin.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://theyearinfood.com/2011/05/the-tippler-rhubarb-fennel-fizz.html">Rhubarb Fennel Fizz</a> is from The Year in Food.</p>

<p>I am promised that if I provide the rhubarb, that gin will be provided to me.</p>

<p>Can't talk about rhubarb without Rhabarberbarbara.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>@tallervielmetti is using my old black Macbook. It's never been an exceptionally fast machine, but it's been super laggy of late, hence the name Lag Monster. </p>

<p>I installed all kinds of crap on that machine to test it out, and never uninstalled a lot of it. It turns out that some judicious uninstalls seemed to help a lot to keep the load average down. Some hints to my future self if these ever re-emerge:</p>

<p>BBLaunchAgent. Yes, relics of my old Blackberry still linger on, and to really and truly kill them I had to edit plists. See <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2752009?start=0&amp;tstart=0">Can't delete BBLaunchAgent.app process</a> for the eventual diff I applied. For a more exhaustive list of Blackberry-uninstalling tools see <a href="https://blog.omgmog.net/post/removing-the-blackberry-desktop-software-for-mac-without-having-to-re-download-a-70mb-installer-from-blackberry/">Removing the Blackberry Desktop Software for Mac without having to re-download a 70mb installer from Blackberry</a>.</p>

<p>Jenkins. Some time in the distant past I installed it, and it launched under Java and ran and did nothing for years except contribute to lag. Killed by removing the install directory and rebooting.</p>

<p>Chrome. Lots of Chrome stuff takes up memory. Particularly contributing to lag was some Reddit page. </p>

<p>At the end we're at</p>

<p>Processes: 77 total, 2 running, 1 stuck, 74 sleeping, 355 threads      22:40:09
 Load Avg: 0.22, 0.67, 0.68  CPU usage: 17.75% user, 12.14% sys, 70.9% idle</p>

<p>Which is, I have to say, a lot better.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some notes before I try to do the build.</p>

<p>The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.</p>

<p>Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.</p>

<p>The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). Some sort of adapter jack (or alligator clips) should be all I need.</p>

<p>I can test the antenna on my Nokia 635 which has an FM tuner connected with the headphone jack as the antenna, and the ideal situation will be to have an antenna that I can just plug either into my phone or into my SDR tuner interchangeably. Once I figure all that out, the next next step is to make these antenna inputs for other radios. One step at a time though.</p>

<p>I'll be working from the tutorial <a href="http://willus.com/author/antenna.shtml">Making a Dipole FM Antenna</a> on willus.com .</p>

      <p>My goal for the week was to empty out my inbox sufficiently that I would be able to make progress on some programming tasks that are hard to do when there's distractions. The inbox got all the way down to zero, and that meant that there was a chunk of evening time suitable for hacking. Happy to report that the result of this is Node-RED running on a Raspberry Pi under Docker on top of Hypriot. A word of explanation of how this all works in detail is too much, but here's where I got the parts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-on-your-arm-device/">Hypriot's gettting started guide</a> brings you up to speed on getting Docker running on your ARM device (e.g. your Raspberry Pi). They have bootable images that you can download and burn to SD card, and from there you load up applications from Docker.</p>

<p>Hypriot has a <a href="https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk">chat window</a> on Gitter, so you can pop in and there will be occasionally people to assist. Best to do things European time.</p>

<p>Docker's <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> is a one stop shop for packaged applications. When you're running on the Pi, you'll want to seek out versions with 'rpi' or 'arm' in their names as they have likely been adapted for that system.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling Niel Eyde's Raspberry Pi versions of Node-RED from DockerHub as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/">nieleyde/rpi-nodered</a>. It has all sorts of interesting modules that I had not previously built.</p>

<p>Node-RED is at 0.10.6 at this writing. Its <a href="http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi support</a> includes hardware support using <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">WiringPi</a> to access the GPIO pins. </p>

<p>Node-RED currently supports Node.JS 0.10. Node.JS and IO.JS have <a href="http://sdtimes.com/node-js-and-io-js-to-merge-under-node-js-foundation/">merged forces</a> after a fork, which means hopefully development will start to be sane again.</p>

<p>That all said I am not sure I have everything I need yet but as a leap forward it's pretty good!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.</p>

<p>For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. </p>

<p>For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. I'm especially happy about the Sony because I had feared that it was a complicated repair. There's some corrosion on the battery terminals and I might be forewarned that would be the first thing to look at again. A discussion of another repair is written up by <a href="http://idlenot.com/?p=1481">KE1RI</a> to replace an audio capacitor, fortunately I haven't had to do that.</p>

<p>Both stations are tuned to R Havana Cuba's Sunday night programming on 6000 KHz.</p>

      <p>The rented lakes of my childhood 
 by Marge Piercy </p>

<pre>
 I remember the lakes of my Michigan
 childhood. Here they are called ponds.
 Lakes belonged to summer, two-week
 vacations that my father was granted by
 Westinghouse when we rented some cabin.

 Never mind the dishes with spiderweb
 cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce
 pans, the crusted black frying pans.
 Never mind the mattresses shaped
 like the letter V. Old jangling springs.

 Moldy bathrooms. Low ceilings
 that leaked. The lakes were mysteries
 of sand and filmy weeds and minnows
 flickering through my fingers. I rowed
 into freedom. Alone on the water

 that freckled into small ripples,
 that raised its hackles in storms,
 that lay glassy at twilight reflecting
 the sunset then sucking up the dark,
 I was unobserved as the quiet doe

 coming with her fauns to drink
 on the opposite shore. I let the row-
 boat drift as the current pleased, lying
 faceup like a photographer’s plate
 the rising moon turned to a ghost.

 And though the voices called me
 back to the rented space we shared
 I was sure I left my real self there-
 a tiny black pupil in the immense
 eye of a silver pool of silence.

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.</p>

<p>I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city's employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained. The city has hired a contractor to handle the building official's role, but that contractor is not working on the day of this meeting. </p>

<p>The group's meetings are in Legistar, which I looked at at 8:30 a.m. today before a 1:30 p.m. meeting. Legistar should have details and staff reports for all of the items on the agenda, but as of 8:30 a.m. there was only the barest detail listed, with five parcels under review but no detail for any of those parcels and no information about old business to be reviewed. Several members of the board noted that they did not get any email from the building department reminding them that there was going to be a meeting, let alone informing them of the agenda.</p>

<p>When I got to the meeting at 1:30 p.m. I find that one of the items was removed from the agenda (that's pretty typical) and there was a bare minimum of documentation for the other four items. Bare minimum in this case included photos but no writeup of the staff recommendation and no detail at all. There were also two surprise agenda items under old business, neither of which had any written supporting documentation.</p>

<p>At the meeting itself there was a fair amount of confusion. One unfortunate petitioner who was asking for a variance for basement apartment filled out his form asking for this as a Housing Board of Appeals request, but then someone (the petitioner or the city, not sure who) whited out the word "Housing" and replaced it with "Building". Some substantial amount of time was spent sorting out which appeals board actually would address the appeal, and the petitioner felt that it should be the Housing Board of Appeals that would address a variance for occupancy.</p>

<p>Of course that discovers another problem. The Housing Board of Appeals, as currently constituted, has three members; but seven are specified by charter, and thus it does not have a quorum and cannot meet.</p>

<p>What kind of Kafkaesque city do we live in where matters are best referred to a body that cannot meet!</p>

<p>I spoke up at public commentary at the end of the meeting, there being no opportunity to speak at the beginning, pointing out some of this sad state of affairs and especially encouraging the board to prepare more carefully for meetings in such a way that members of the public would be able to avail themselves of information about the matters coming before the board. Certainly there is public interest in some of the long-term dilapidated buildings that have come before the board - in particular 410 Miller, which has been a mess as long as I can recall - but there being no adequate agenda publicized there is no way for the public to be even aware that a discussion is going on.</p>

<p>When is Ann Arbor going to have a full time building official? Without someone in an official position to make the department work, the city's systems for handling exceptional cases appears to be entirely and completely broken. I can only imagine that routine issues are under a similar sort of chaotic pressure.</p>
