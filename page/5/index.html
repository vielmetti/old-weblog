      </h3>
      <p>Beer Stew</p>

<p>From Tish Osborn- Originally from Ada Vielmetti (Nana) &amp; Aunt Florence Burt</p>

<p>To serve @ 6 people, use:</p>

<p>4 lbs. Of good Stew Meat</p>

<p>2 lb. Onions, thickly sliced</p>

<p>Flour to dredge meat</p>

<p>Oil to brown meat, in a large skillet</p>

<p>6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed</p>

<p>3T Dark Brown Sugar</p>

<p>¼ cup red wine vinegar</p>

<p>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</p>

<p>2 small bay leaves, put in whole</p>

<p>1 t. dried thyme leaves.....  Or 2 tsps. of fresh</p>

<p>1 T. salt</p>

<p>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>

<p>2 bottles of GOOD beer.  I often use English Stout</p>

<p>2 10 ½ oz cans of Beef Broth [not Consume`]</p>

<p>[Dumpling mix…. recipe below, put on at end of cooking time.]</p>

<p>·        Cut beef into bite-size pieces.  Dredge in flour and brown in skillet with a little oil, before putting in an ovenproof casserole dish.  [I use a large roaster]</p>

<p>·        When all beef has been browned, add a little more oil, and sauté onion and garlic just until soft.</p>

<p>·        Add the onion and garlic to the casserole with the meat; except beer and broth.</p>

<p>·        Mix well.</p>

<p>·        Add broth to skillet to de-glaze pan.  Add all other ingredients, and stir to make sure sugar is dissolved. Pour over meat mixture and stir again. </p>

<p>·        Add beer.  Stir all together.</p>

<p>·        Cover casserole and cook at 325 degrees for @ 2-3 hours.</p>

<p>·        Note:  The stew will appear to be very runny.  The dumplings seem to absorb some of the liquid. </p>

<p>·        Mix dumplings together just before you are ready to serve stew.  Drop spoon dumplings on top of meat, put the lid back on the casserole and bake for 15 minutes without lifting lid.</p>

<p>·        Serve, and expect accolades. J</p>

<p>I often just mix up Bisquick dumplings....but here’s the original recipe.</p>

<p>[Optional Dumpling recipe]</p>

<p>2 cups sifted self-rising flour</p>

<p>¾ cup of milk</p>

<p>2T. Melted butter</p>

<p>A little chopped parsley if you like, for flavor.</p>

<p>Mix together and drop on the stew.  Cook 15 min as directed.</p>

      <p>The challenge I put to myself is to spend not more than $100 and get a functioning solar powered charging station. The alternate name is a "camping power supply" for off-the-grid operations.</p>

<p>Breaking down the components it looks like this would be a combination of the following:</p>

<p>Solar panel. Estimate as a start that you want to generate 40 watts of power at peak times, using a panel that's small enough and portable enough that you can move it to where there's the best sun, but not necessarily so portable that you're carrying it with you in your backpack.</p>

<p>Voltage regulator. Take the power off the panel and regulate it so that it can provide a safe and steady 12 volt current. </p>

<p>Deep cycle battery. Provide a battery backup for your system, so that you have enough power to recharge a phone. Note that these might be bundled into "portable car jump starters", so shop at your favorite auto parts store too.</p>

<p>Powered USB hub. If you were building this strictly out of components, you'd look for a device that was powered by 12V and that provided 5V USB power at 2A for as many sockets as you had phones that you wanted to simultaneously charge.</p>

<p>Inverter. Convert 12V DC to 120V AC, for some small number of amps; for maximum flexibility in supporting devices that need AC. (I already have one of these in my car that's rated at 12V, 10 amps.)</p>

<p>Backpack battery pack. I'm imagining something a little bit bigger than a phone but smaller than a laptop that's just a battery brick providing USB power at 5V and 2A to charge a phone.</p>

<p>Remember that the budget for all of this is $100, so there may be unavoidable conflicts in requirements because all of this stuff just costs more than that; I don't really know.</p>

<p>I'll update this post with specific descriptions of components and approximate pricing available in late 2014.</p>

<p>UPDATE 9/9/14</p>

<p>Some brand names to start out:</p>

<p>Nokero ("no kerosene") makes direct charging devices and solar light bulbs. A device with a solar panel and no battery that can charge your burner phone (not your iPhone or iPad) runs $20-25. <a href="http://www.nokero.com">nokero.com</a> Via John Hritz, who pointed me at <a href="http://inhabitat.com/how-the-nokero-sunray-pro-power-solar-charger-saved-my-skin-my-sanity-during-hurricane-sandy/">this account on Inhabitant</a> of how a Nokero device was used during Hurricane Sandy as a cell phone charger that actually worked.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every Thursday at the a2b3 lunch, we talk about upcoming events for the next week and month and season for the Ann Arbor area. It's a good way to hear about what's coming up, and to hear from people who are organizing events in the future who need help now for planning and gaining support.</p>

<p>I've been unburdening my inbox of events notices by sending them out to Twitter. It strikes me that I could almost as easily do that here in this weblog, since there's an "events" category. The question is when you're trying to empty out an inbox what the quick path to "pass along the news" is, especially when you're not so well connected to the event that you might not even know enough to get the news promptly when things are cancelled.</p>

<p>The radio events calendar that I listen to is the WCBN-FM effort which is broadcast about eight times a day. <a href="http://www.wcbn.org/events">wcbn.org/events</a>.</p>

<p>The monthly print calendar that's the easiest to follow is the Ann Arbor Observer calendar, with such a following that its deadline schedule drives booking decisions at venues around town. The online iteration of it lives at <a href="http://annarborobserver.com">annarborobserver.com</a></p>

<p>The online calendar that was comprehensive beyond belief came from the Ann Arbor Chronicle, who aggregated online calendars from dozens of venue calendars. The Chronicle is closing shop, and so the long term true home of its calendar may change. <a href="http://events.annarborchronicle.com/html">events.annarborchronicle.com</a></p>

<p>I've been super surprised at how useful Meetup.com has been to find out about events happening around you, and to publicize upcoming events to people who are interested but who you don't already know.</p>

<p>Word of mouth is always the best way to get the word out; you're welcome to join us for lunch Thursdays. Pay for your own lunch, we have introductions at 12:30 p.m., and events are last on the agenda that tries very hard to end at or about 1:00 p.m. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch</a></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Essential components of Ann Arbor Weather Twitter:</p>

<p>In an emergency, call 911.</p>

<p>911 trunk lines can go down in storms. The Ann Arbor non-emergency police number is (734) 994-2911, put it in your cell phone.</p>

<p>Sirens: City sirens are tested on the second Tuesdays of the month at 1 pm. A small handful of us notice this and tweet SIRENS. Generally siren activation in any quantity will prompt twitter chatter. </p>

<p>Hashtags: #miwx is primary, but I also watch or post to #annarbor and #skywarn.</p>

<p>Amateur radio: get your ham radio license (check), an inexpensive handheld 2m VHF radio (check), a decent antenna (check), and Skywarn spotter training (to do for 2015). During severe weather monitor N8DUY 145.15 Mhz, located at the corner of I-94 and M-14 in Scio Township. Someone, somewhere, should have a Broadcastify feed for a scanner listening to that channel with backup power and good solid Internet; that's a missing link right now.</p>

<p>Who to follow: you're going to have to figure some of that out by yourself, but the list https://twitter.com/vielmetti/lists/annarbor and https://twitter.com/vielmetti/lists/weather might be a good start.</p>

<p>Power outages: If you have a smart enough smart phone, get the DTE Energy mobile app. If not, add the DTE Energy number 800-477-4747 to your phone to report outages. Follow @dte_energy and use hashtag #poweroutage I guess. The DTE outage map: http://www.dteenergy.com/map/outage.html . A snapshot of the September 5, 2014 map is below after severe storms knocked out power to more than 10,000 subscribers in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2014-09-05 at 10.05.48 PM" title="Screen shot 2014-09-05 at 10.05.48 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Location: if you report severe weather or storm damage or a power outage, give a neighborhood name or a cross street. If you don't know every neighborhood, Arborwiki can be a good place to look them up. Find at least one other person who is geographically nearby to you and follow them - there's no where near the neighborhood density on Twitter that there is on Facebook or email, but in Ann Arbor at least the network is dense enough.</p>

<p>Cameras: Post your favorite weather photos or videos to your favorite social network. Note that the current structure of Twitter, Instagram, and Vine all lend themselves to real-time reporting in ways that Facebook does not, but Facebook and Youtube might reach more people over all if your post is interesting. Tag with your favorite hashtag.</p>

<p>Teenage Twitter: Adults and teens don't often mix on Twitter, so it's good to follow parents of teens who will relay news and give you a heads up about what's happening. As an alternative, create a Twitter list of teenagers and don't follow them but do check in when conditions warrant.</p>

<p>Adult Twitter: Teens and adults don't often mix on Twitter, so it's good to follow teenagers whose parents are also on Twitter who will similarly relay news.</p>

<p>College Twitter: Sometimes the U of Michigan seems like it's its own city within a city, but during severe weather the official @umich account will be aware of what's going on especially if there are alerts that need to go to all students.</p>

<p>Local government Twitter: In an emergency, call 911. The @a2gov account is not always monitored, but when it is monitored during weather it can be helpful to guide you through the maze of municipal issues to report a problem.</p>

<p>Real time lightning maps: Several services have real time or near real time lightning. I like the non-commercial blitzortung.org and its companion site lightningmaps.org . </p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is a partial text of the public comments I gave at the September 3, 2014 meeting, for the record. Please incorporate these comments into the public record of the meeting. I have provided a copy of these comments to Susan Pollay in advance of my presentation.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>I wish to address two issues: copyrights on DDA maps and public notice of the Bill's Beer Garden meeting</p>

<p>The Downtown Development Authority maintains a map, created by the City of Ann Arbor, showing the official DDA boundaries. It is an essential document to define the DDA and should be readily available to anyone. However, the map contains this copyright notice:</p>

<p>"No part of this product shall be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose, without prior written permission from the City of Ann Arbor. This map complies with National Map Accuracy Standards for mapping at 1 Inch = 100 Feet. The City of Ann Arbor and its mapping contractors assume no legal representation for the content and/or inappropriate use of information on this map."</p>

<p>This is an unreasonable copyright notice, and should be replaced promptly and at the very minimum with a copyright notice explicitly allowing reuse. </p>

<p>Regarding the Bill's Beer Garden meeting:</p>

<p>A notice I received during this meeting from the Twitter account of Bill's Beer Garden noted that the venue is not open until 5:30 p.m., though the published meeting time is 5:00 p.m. In the interest of following both the letter and the spirit of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, which states in part</p>

<p>"All meetings of a public body shall be open to the public and shall be held in a place available to the general public. "</p>

<p>The signage at Bill's Beer Garden must make it clear to the public that a public meeting is being held and that the general public is able to attend. In particular, there is a concern that since this venue serves alcohol, that there may be restrictions on individuals to attend who are under the legal drinking age.</p>

<p>Thank your for your time.</p>

<p>Stephen,</p>

<p>Redistricting maps available on the city's website contain the
following verbiage:</p>

<p>"No part of this product shall be reproduced or transmitted in any
form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose,
without prior written permission from the City of Ann Arbor. This map
complies with National Map Accuracy Standards for mapping at 1 Inch =
100 Feet. The City of  Ann Arbor and its mapping contractors assume no
legal representation for the content and/or inappropriate use of
information on this map."</p>

<p>We are writing to advise you that nobody needs the city's permission
for any of this, because these maps are public documents. The
Chronicle will be treating the maps as the public documents, which
they are. We will not be asking anyone for written permission to use
these maps.</p>

<p>We think you should take steps to remove the language on the maps so
that the information is not unnecessarily restricted in its possible
dissemination. [Suppose for example, the president of a neighborhood
association sees the language and mistakenly thinks that the city can
actually require her to get permission before including the map in a
neighborhood news letter, and decides to leave it out of the
newsletter, because she has no idea who to ask for permission.]</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dave</p>

<p>Comments as presented to the Ann Arbor City Council for the September 2, 2014 meeting.</p>

<p>Four very brief topics: municipal maps, public records, closed captioning and the city web site. These are my intended comments at the end of the meeting.</p>

<p>Regarding municipal maps, I would point out that any of the maps generated by the city in your packet have a very strict copyright on them prohibiting redistribution without the express written consent of the city. This is but one of several easily addressable flaws in the city mapping project.</p>

<p>Regarding public records, the current system of Legistar for publication of attachments to the agenda is very difficult in that it is impossible to search through the full text of attached items. Some municipal data activists in other cities have taken to wholesale downloading of the entire site to get around the problems with access.</p>

<p>Regarding closed captioning, it is my understanding that the Disability Commission is going to have closed captioning of its meetings, and I urge you to direct the city administrator to direct CTN to provide closed captioning of City Council meetings.</p>

<p>Finally regarding the city web site. It is more of a thing of beauty than the previous version, but in the process several hundreds of pages have gone missing, either by renaming of previous URLs or removal of content, and I urge you to take action to remedy these failings.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>Of the many facets of the criminal world, few have captured society’s fascination as 
has that of high stakes robbery. The combination of meticulousness, cunning, and 
audacity required to execute a real-life Ocean’s Eleven may be uncommon among 
criminals, but fortunately it is common enough to extract a wealth of lessons for the 
protection of high-value assets. To assist in informing the analyses and decisions of 
security professionals, this paper surveys 23 sophisticated and high-value heists that 
have occurred or been attempted around the world, particularly over the past three 
decades. The results, compiled in a Heist Methods and Characteristics Database, 
have been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, with the goals of both identifying 
common characteristics and characterizing the range and diversity of criminal 
methods used. The analysis is focused in six areas: (1) Defeated Security Measures 
and Devices, (2) Deception Methods, (3) Timing, (4) Weapons, (5) Resources, and 
(6) Insiders.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have written about here previously about Stanford researcher BJ Fogg in the context of his "Tiny Habits" project. He has a talk here from 2012 about the "motivation wave" and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low. The challenge is to get people to do things when they are motivated that allow them to expand their capacity to be on task when they are not motivated, e.g. by making it possible for them to get small and easy wins and tiny successes when their personal motivation is at a low ebb. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-08-28-building-a-marquette-localwiki/">Building a Marquette Localwiki</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I visit Marquette Michigan every summer to see family and catch up with friends and visit the place I went to high school. Every so often there's a reunion, but often it's just a matter of going back to the home town and figuring out what's up and what's what.</p>

<p>Since I've been working on Arborwiki for the better part of eight years, I thought last year that I'd give a try to make a <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi">Localwiki for Marquette</a>. Technologically it was easy to do - Localwiki makes adding new regions easy - but practically it's got some challenges. Here are notes on what it means to look at Localwiki for a rural area.</p>

<p>The first most obvious thing to note is that there often are places and locations that don't have a currently updated home page. If you want to document the area, you have to attach a lot of things to its history, and the places like closed mines, abandoned railroads, long-gone restaurants, shuttered gas stations, and the like have to be created from scratch and not simply replicated from existing content. This is typical of the history portion of any Localwiki effort, in that local histories of otherwise not notable enough for Wikipedia things demand a combination of original research and local knowledge. The page I started for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Red_Road">Red Road</a> is one example of this.</p>

<p>When you're doing a map of areas that are relatively rural, you find that the default street map used by Localwiki isn't that interesting. As much as I know it's difficult to do, I wish the system had easier ways of integrating other map sources into the effort. Street maps are really the wrong tool when you're looking at areas that are mostly woods; you'd like a topo map, maybe, and a plat map that showed land ownership, and a geological surface map that gave some hint what the land looked like and a forest map that showed which lands were in commercial forest. None of these are likely to show up in Google Maps any time soon.</p>

<p>Trails and non-motorized pathways are a big opportunity for Localwiki. My mom is working on a project for signage for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Iron_Ore_Heritage_Trail">Iron Ore Heritage Trail</a>, and I've put the bug in her ear that it might be interesting to cross-link somehow the interpretive signs on the trail with the corresponding Localwiki pages. Even getting good photography and mapping of trail heads would be a big enough project that I can imagine spending a week scouting out locations and not being done.</p>

<p>There's a concern at the Wikipedia project that linking to Localwiki pages is somehow dicey because of advertising on Localwiki, or perhaps because not enough people on Wikipedia are familiar enough with Localwiki to know what to expect when they see a page. As a contrast, there are also concerns on a Facebook group I follow about "wikishit" when people see a years-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marquette_Monster&amp;oldid=622698099">Marquette Monster</a> page that was completely fabricated.</p>

<p>I'll look for more ways to get more reliable information into the Marquette Localwiki. I'm particularly happy with the start that the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Gazetteer">Gazetteer</a> page has for listing location, and there's some long amount of work to give the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Mines">Mines</a> page its due to document the mining history of the area. I'm not sure the system has a single goal, but I'm always happy when other people pick up on it, add their piece, and make it useful to themselves.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The St Louis, Missouri Localwiki - <a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis">http://localwiki.net/st-louis</a> - was mostly empty when the events in Ferguson, MO started on August 9, 2014 with the death of 18 year old student Michael Brown. As with any event where there's a lot that's going on in an unfamiliar area, I was drawn to making some sense of what was happening. This has been especially true when the coverage on the #<a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/ferguson">ferguson</a> hashtag overwhelmed my Twitter feed, which had been usually quiet at night.</p>

<p>The Localwiki crew - including Jason Denizac, Marina Kukso, Philip Neustrom, James Halliday, and others have been super helpful in filling in the blanks on the Localwiki map around Ferguson. It's been helpful to get one step away from the relentless outsider media scrum and read background pieces by local journalists from places like the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/Riverfront_Times">Riverfront Times</a>, the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/St._Louis_American">St. Louis American</a>, and the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. </p>

<p>Writing and editing a localwiki has been a helpful way for me to process some of the difficult things that have gone on. It turns a helpless feeling into some sort of community engagement. I am conscious that I'm not always going to be engaged in this effort at the level that I am now, so there's some extra care not to leave too many loose ends in the process. As of this writing (August 21, 2014) there are about 150 pages in the St. Louis Localwiki, which is just barely a start.</p>

<p>Ideally someone local to the scene would eventually happen upon the localwiki and find it useful, or someone who was comfortable in the localwiki space would move to the area and be drawn to it as a way to document their surroundings. To some extent I feel like as much of an outside tourist as the news media that parachuted into the area to cover events; yet it doesn't really feel that way so much. Time will tell.</p>

      <p>The 6 year run of the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> is coming to a close. The end date will be Septmeber 2, 2014, which happens to be an Ann Arbor City Council night as well.</p>

<p>The Chronicle was noted for its relentless and exhausting coverage of civic meetings. You could get the feeling that you too had sat on the hard benches for hours as you read through a 15,000 word account of what transpired. Hey, you could even read 6,000 words from time to time about meetings that never got a quorum.</p>

<p>I'll miss the Chronicle, which was one beacon of honest (if quirky) journalism in a town that hasn't always had a newspaper that I've looked forward to reading. It will become just a little harder to keep up with municipal government, and more people in government will get a free pass because they don't have a critical eye focused on what they do. I completely understand that six years of two people's lives is a lot to give for the cause of local journalism, and I wish Dave and Mary the best.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Avoid the long lines and sit down quickly with these tips at Zingerman's Deli.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the bread counter in the deli. After you taste the samples, get a bagel. Ask them to slice it. (Or ask for one of their yummy bialys which I did last time I was there.)</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to the deli counter or the fish counter, if you're hungry for same. Ask for something you'd like to put on that bagel.</p></li>
<li><p>Go ahead to the head of the line! You don't need to wait for the long lines at the sandwich ordering counter. If you want something to drink, you can get it at checkout. Assemble the sandwich yourself when you get to your seat.</p></li>
<li><p>Interested in a more substantial sandwich? You can get premade sandwiches that are delicious (but smaller than the big Zingerman's sandwiches) at Zingerman's Next Door.</p></li>
<li><p>Call ahead! You can phone in your order ahead of time and have it ready when you get there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's not really a secret menu, but it does let you walk in, grab something delicious, and go sit down and take in the scene. It also lets you get through the line in only a few minutes.</p>

<p>The corresponding power outage map is from <a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap">Consumers Energy</a>. Outage reporting generally lags behind realtime by 15-30 minutes, and of course not every lightning strike turns into a power problem (though sometimes it seems like it does).</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>ANN ARBOR, July 1, 2014: The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission is considering the Glendale Condominiums, a proposed development at 312 Glendale Place. Neighbors came out in force to oppose the development, citing among other things the impact that the proposed new impervious surface would exacerbate the existing flooding events that have affected the nearby neighborhoods. The developer has proposed an above ground storm water retention system, using a pond to capture the runoff and retain water on site so that the water from the parking lots doesn't rush into neighbor basements.</p>

<p>A number of homeowners downstream from the development are already using sump pumps to keep their basements dry. Having a sump pump running in your basement continuously for hours or even days is not something that homeowners look forward to managing. Since the water flow through the entire system (Allen Creek) can make its way into basements anywhere downstream, the residents from the whole watershed have an interest in the issue.</p>

<p>The internet of sump pumps, if it were to exist, would give some overall understanding for city planners and water resources managers. It would let you know not only whether your sump pump is running, but also whether your neighbors pumps are running, and maybe also the total flows and total energy consumed by the pumping systems. If it existed - and it doesn't yet, not to my knowledge - we could make decisions about developments like this based on actual stormwater data and not anecdotes and stories.</p>

<p>There have been a number of attempts made by individual homeowners around the world to control their sump pumps or monitor their sump pumps with the current set of small internet devices like the Raspberry Pi. Expensive industrial pumps come with network interfaces like MODBUS that offer site managers control and integration into SCADA systems. To make this work you need level sensors, controllable pumps, moisture sensors, and other sensor and control infrastructure just to make the system work. Beyond that, you'd want remote monitoring of the various sensor so that you could tell whether it's working or not and also generate pretty graphs and reports and urgent pages to your favorite plumber to bring the system back online if it fails.</p>

<p>The internet of sump pumps is in its infancy. You'll find home made systems like Greg's Sump Pump, aka Sumpy McPumperton, which tweets out its current status. You'll also find top-of-the-line systems with built-in hardwired internet connections and some kind of artificial intelligence. (Sumpy is pretty smart, though.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The single most popular page on this web site is the power outage tracking map collection page. It has static copies of samples of power outage maps from utilities around the country, and it gets bunches of hits every single time there's bad weather - to the extent that I can pretty much tell where there's bad weather by the outbound clicks on the page.</p>

<p>The page, however, is not fed with live data; it only has static instances of previous maps. It in and of itself doesn't alert when there's trouble, and it doesn't let you know that the storm coming your way might be severe.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of automation in the utility outage map space is the diversity of vendors for power company outage maps and the utter lack of any standard interface. To dig out how many people have lost their power in 48104 under program control, you actually have to work at it, and to rely on undocumented interfaces that could change at any time. For all of the user-friendly efforts out there, there's a lot of systems that are hard to pull raw data from.</p>

<p>I've started a very tiny version of what I suspect could be a complete project, namely to automate the alerting when a few zip codes around me have outages. The code, written in Node-RED, runs periodically to poll the DTE Energy outage map site and to ask for outage data for a few specific zip codes. It then parses that data in a Javascript/node.js node which returns it to a switch that decides whether to alert (in my case, when there are more than 250 outages in any given monitored zipcode). Alerts go out via Twitter on the @vielmetti account and via SMS to me.</p>

<p>The monitoring task for the adjacent utility company, Consumers Energy, is a bit different. I haven't completed this effort yet, but again a poll of their site will pull a report which in this case has a list of counties and an outage count in each county. There's a few counties that I'm monitoring, and I'll figure out the threshold for alerts there.</p>

<p>Node-RED is a nice programming environment for this, since it's flexible in many ways about how data gets into it and how and when alerts are done. I'm still sorting through the new "trigger" alert node in 0.8.0 which makes it possible to buffer up things so you don't get an overflow of messages all at once, and there's some subtle alarm-management logic that I want to get right so that this system can be used for real alerting and not just curiosity.</p>

<p>When Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast, there was a long delay between the time that power went out and when it was restored, and there was some innovation in outage tracking and holding public utilities accountable for restoration performance. Similarly, when a storm hit the East Lansing, MI area there were furious municipal power consumers outraged that their utility company didn't have an accurate tracking map.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this starts to look like an architecture for outage tracking that can be refined over time, and I'd be super happy if utility companies started to post outage information in any reasonable easy to parse JSON or XML format files (really, it just has to be published, standards can occur as we get experience). I'll poll regularly enough to get some kind of timeline as to when the lights went out and how long it took for them to return.</p>

<p>I have found myself thinking about things, and how to connect things to the net, quite a bit recently. I'll be blogging more about it here and elsewhere.</p>

<p>By "things" I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can't connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do. In the middle of this network there are message routing systems, and at the human edge there are various points where people need to make decisions about what should happen next.</p>

<p>Things are fascinating in many places that the web is not. Treating web site visitors like so many pinballs through a funnel dehumanizes them, but that's a lot of what makes people focus on user behavior. </p>

<p>I've been building things out of smaller things, learning how to plumb them together, understanding message flows and designing out behaviors. It's transformative in the way that making web pages never will be transformative.  The task now is to write some of this stuff up, the late night experiments and the discovery of new hardware and the task of plugging things together and making them work. </p>

It's a hacker space in a basement on E Liberty St in downtown Ann Arbor (at Maynard Street), where Dawn Treader was once upon a time and later Digital Ops.</p>

<p>I decided a few weeks ago to become a member, so that I'd have a workshop that was well stocked with equipment and so that I could start working on projects in a place that not only had cool stuff but also that had smart people and was convenient to downtown.</p>

<p>What's the project for summer 2014? Certainly a piece of it is getting a new Raspberry Pi hooked up and running and getting some blinking lights attached to it. The next order of business past that is unclear. I'm interested in short-haul digital radios for remote monitoring and control systems, and there are some Arduino based kits (the <a href="http://moderndevice.com/product/jeenode-smd/">Jeenode</a>, for instance) that look like they would be useful for radio-based efforts. </p>

<p>At some point I'll want to learn how to solder, if only because there's some things you can only build when you know how to do more than plug cables together!</p>

<p>What do you do with the Internet of Cats? You have a cat with a collar, and some number of grams of electronics that can be affixed to the collar. What kind of interesting internet stuff can go there?</p>

It's about the size of a quarter, which looks like a reasonable size, but all of the applications for it that I've seen so far at retail are local area network direct attachments and not wide area network systems.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was productive this morning, cranking out about 1500 words in the span of a couple of hours without much in the way of distractions. It was a timely day to be productive, and the morning's activity resulted in a further productive afternoon meeting. It was a good day. (Not every day is always a good day for writing.)</p>

<p>How do I get away from distractions? The key was to find an unusual place in this world: a location with good enough coffee, enough power outlets, broken wifi and no cell service. (It was the Scio Township Panera, if you're wondering.) The lack of T-Mobile service, and the downtime on the Panera wifi, meant that I could easily ignore the dozens of email messages that I might answer and the infinite stream of things to read online and instead open up a terminal window, open up vim, and start typing until the screen filled up and then some.</p>

<p>The problem with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/the-problem-with-unreliablenetworks-is-that-you-have-to-engineer-extra-hard-to-be-able-to-make-use-of-them-and-you-still-ca.html">unreliable networks</a> is that you have to work extra hard to get any value out of them, enough to distract you entirely from their use. When the Internet is completely down, though, it's much easier. I have good enough writing tools to create prose without an Internet necessary for looking things up, and the notes I was working from were all on paper. Any research I needed to do during the course of the writing got marked with an XXX, and when the Panera wifi came back online, I was able to fill in a few gaps.</p>

<p>It takes either a little bit of good luck or a great deal of self discipline to go off the net. Modern computing systems assume that always-on is the normal case, and that offline behavior is anomalous. Indeed there are systems like the Chromebook that are completely crippled without a network there to make them happy, but no one I know sells a laptop that doesn't have wifi built in.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Did you ever wake up from a long session online and discover that you had very little to show for it? </p>

<p>There's a pattern of internet use that's simple and very disturbingly unproductive. Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn't produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you've visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there's something new.</p>

<p>It's a wonderful way to consume content, and since you're always looking at new things it's a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty. Subscribe to enough people, join enough networks, and you could fill your hours with new things indefinitely.</p>

<p>What this doesn't provide you with is a chance to create your own thing. Sure, you can share, retweet, bookmark, comment, or favorite, but that's not the same as picking an idea that's fresh and spending a few minutes from scratch presenting something new - not just new to you, but new to the world.</p>

<p>Creating something from nothing is much more difficult work than reading or looking what what other people have done. It takes time, and more importantly it forces you to risk making something that other people will judge. I heartily recommend getting off the social network refresh treadmill from time to time and writing something longer, even if it's not perfect.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here's a latest try.</p>

<p>There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban:
1. Visualize your work
2. Limit your work-in-progress</p>

<p>I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/personal-kanban-from-jim-benson-and-modus-cooperandi.html">wrote about Personal Kanban before</a> back in 2010, but I didn't try to put it into practice as such.</p>

<p>Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There's a <a href="http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/boardthing/">review of Boardthing</a> from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it's a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board. The little rectangles each have some text or an image in them, and they can be nested so you can move them around in groups. There's really not much more than that, and it runs in a browser.</p>

<p>This infrastructure is enough to create a Personal Kanban board. Create little rectangles at minimum for "Things to do", "Doing", and "Done", and type into the little rectangles to move them around until you figure out what to do, stop typing, and get something done. I recommend a "Things not to do" rectangle as an added productivity boost.</p>

<p>How does this work in the long term? The system is pretty light weight, and it saves your state between sessions. I suppose if your page gets too cluttered you can start a new one that is more focused. Having a smallish screen forces you to limit your work in progress, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave Gray and Jim Benson have a set of approaches that should work well together, this is mostly written for the both of them as an introduction of sorts.</p>

      <p>The latest update for Arborwiki is that the database is now hosted on the Localwiki central platform. This gives us updated maps, current software, and additional central hosting support. The cut over was on May 1, 2014.</p>

<p>All of the old Arborwiki URLs still work; you can get to the home page at <a href="http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor">http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor</a> or at <a href="http://arborwiki.org">http://arborwiki.org</a> . We fixed a temporary problem where old URLs with a /city/ prefix stopped working.</p>

<p>One of the things that is clear from the effort is that there's a lot of Ypsilanti content originally hosted at YpsiWiki that could, with the right people, be easily hived off into its own project also under the Localwiki umbrella but with its own home page and look.</p>

  <p>No one was killed or injured when more than a dozen CSX tanker cars derailed on Wednesday afternoon, but the resulting fire and spill prompted City Manager Kimball Payne to declare an emergency and temporarily evacuate part of downtown.</p>
  
  <p>The spill also prompted Richmond utility officials to prepare to possibly switch to an alternative source for the city’s drinking water supply, which depends primarily on the James. With the river at flood stage, that isn’t likely, said city officials, who plan to use booms to capture any oil nearing the treatment plant.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the "Paid for by" language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work to do to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.</p>

<p>I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook. I also looked generally at Google, searching for the phrase in question. The four candidates for the Democratic side of the Ann Arbor mayoral ballot are Stephen Kunselman, Sally Hart Petersen, Sabra Briere and Christopher Taylor.</p>

<p>Stephen Kunselman: while I can find a "Kunselman for Council" web site, I can't locate a "Kunselman for Mayor" web site. The candidate's Facebook page doesn't mention the candidacy that I can see. I haven't seen any ads from the candidate yet. </p>

<p>Sally Hart Petersen: No search results on Google for the mayoral campaign. A Facebook page for the candidate has 294 likes; in the header, it says "Paid for by the Committee to Elect Sally Hart Petersen to Mayor", but that header omits the expected address of the committee. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>Sabra Briere: A search for "Paid for by Sabra Briere for Mayor" generates two pages. The http://sabrabriereformayor.org/ web page has "Paid for by Sabra Briere for City Council" at the bottom, in white type on a yellow background making it virtually unreadable; it also has bunches of Latin text where the real text should be, making me suspicious that it's not real. On Facebook, the page "Vote for Sabra for Ann Arbor Mayor in the Democratic Primary on Tuesday August 5th 2014" has invited 500 people, but has no "Paid for by" disclosure. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Sabra Briere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, sabrabriereformayor.org is a non-working website.  A completely different set of pages should be up soon - but in the meantime, I changed the accent yellow to an accent blue - so the white lettering is now higher contrast.</p>
  
  <p>It isn't at all ready to be published, and is just there as filler for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Taylor: A search for "Paid for by Christopher Taylor for Mayor" has 49 results, from the candidate's own web site and from "ngpvanhost". (<a href="http://www.ngpvan.com/">NGP VAN</a> is a campaign website hosting platform for Democrats.) The "Christopher Taylor for Ann Arbor" Facebook page has 686 likes, with no "Paid for by" until you get to the "Contribute" page. Facebook ads for Taylor say "Sponsored", but do not disclose who is paying for them in either the text of the ad or in the image associated with the ad.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Christopher Taylor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that we included the proper disclosure language in the initial ad, but that for some reason it is not appearing. We're on it and will fix it pronto.</p>
  
  <p>I appreciate the notification.</p>

<p>Are any of these clearcut campaign violations? Probably not. The relevant text of the law is "Any other medium used for campaign purposes shall clearly and unequivocally include the identification or disclaimer, or both, provided in section 47 of the act." Michigan campaign finance law has not been updated to provide specific rules for Facebook (or Twitter), so you can't point to a specific line of text that says "you did this wrong". Without specific guidance, there's wiggle room, and a wait for an opinion from the Attorney General.</p>

<p>Is this "flyspecking", as one candidate described my efforts, or mere "piffle" as another political operative chided me? It's still early in the race, but expectations are that this will be one of the most expensive political races in Ann Arbor mayoral history, with four primary campaigns going and an empty mayoral seat at stake. I fully expect my Facebook timeline and Google search results to be full of paid advertising, and that that advertising will get more and more political as the primary draws near. Close attention to who is paying how much for what is worthwhile, especially in the presence of "free media" like Facebook where you can sent out an unrelenting stream of updates and invites at no obvious direct cost to anyone except the poor reader who just wants to see funny cat videos.</p>

      <p>In my case, that means in part going through my inbox with a sharp eye and saying "can I unsubscribe from this?" I was astounded to figure out just how many times I was able to say "yes" to that question. The hope is that the inbox gets a little bit less cluttered.</p>

<p>I'm sure some marketing department got a little bit sad. Every unsubscribe routine is a little bit different, but the usual drill ends with a plaintive "we're sorry to see you go, did we do something wrong to offend you?" Either you ignore that screen, or you click the politest thing that makes sense to click. Sometimes there's a super-sad follow up automated email, "you're off the list now, did you make a mistake?"</p>

<p>No mistake. I don't need your weekly advertising specials, your cheap flights to places I'm not going to, your chirpy newsletter full of details of events I'm not going to. Trust me, if I need you, I can type your URL into a browser. What I don't need is a daily / weekly reminder that I'm not interested right now.</p>
