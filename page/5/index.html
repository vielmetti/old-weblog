        <p>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when voter turnout is very low. I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on, or the perpetually politically curious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In the case of experts &ldquo;writing down what they know&rdquo;, and incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base. One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&rsquo;s no internal inconsistencies. The world usually works in such a way that it&rsquo;s changing fast enough that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is always holding as &ldquo;true&rdquo; in that memory bank something that is demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Michigan Emergency Incidents is a news service that covers emergency dispatch around the state of Michigan.

        <p>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to, in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&rsquo;s one way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers. The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages. Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many advertisements as we will stand. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-02-blogroll/">&raquo;</a></p>

First, the upbeat Bloomberg Business article of July 10, 2015: &hellip; SoundCloud’s potential is fascinating, and perhaps unique.

        <p>Blog every day, whether you want to or not. Pick a topic, learn it well, and write about it as you learn it. Or pick a topic you know really well already and teach to it. Sometimes you can do both. The time spent blogging can&rsquo;t be any less worthwhile than time spent on Facebook or Twitter. The exchange is, instead of clicking the like button and the favorite button, you actually have to think a little bit and write something down that makes sense. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-28-we-should-do-more-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I bought a little box of tomatillos from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them. Suggestions so far include: fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa raw tomatillo salsa a la Rick Bayless fried with onions and then add to scrambled eggs for tortillas baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti in pastel de Montezuma What I ended up making was a very simplified version of Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos, reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-tomatillo/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at times system called Zemanta.

        <p>Daily coffee and wifi at Argus Farm Stop, outside in the sunshine under a lovely red umbrella canopy. Espresso over ice and a day-old olive twist. The view is of a Sky Trak lift at the construction site across moving materials to the back of The Mark, a building that&rsquo;s going up where the car wash used to be. The news of the day is a death on State Street. A young man was climbing over the skylights at the Nickels Arcade and fell to his death when the skylight glass gave way. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-24-daily-coffee-wifi-argus-farm-stop/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Little Bird is a system that helps you discover influencers and experts in any topic. I&rsquo;m at the very start of a 7 day trial. Marshall Kirkpatrick is CEO of Little Bird, and he has been active on Twitter posting interesting ideas about influence marketing - and given that it seemed prudent to give the product a try. Pricing is aimed at agencies, not individuals, so I&rsquo;m going to look at this product through the eyes of people doing &ldquo;social listening&rdquo; for a living, tracking the messages that appear on a topic and either quietly making sense of what is happening or actively engaging with those people to try to influence their opinions. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-22-little-bird/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Out for a bike ride to Malletts Creek Branch Library after a delicious lunch of BBQ at Ricewood. One of the challenges of low overhead custom postcard making is getting an image manipulation pipeline that kicks out photos that a appropriately cropped and sized.

Biggby Packard is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so. Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&rsquo;s not really enough here to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus.
