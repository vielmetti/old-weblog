<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-fire.html">The City of Ann Arbor has started an email-based delivery service for changes and updates to the city&#39;s web site run by GovDelivery.</a>&#0160; I contacted Dave Sommerness, a University of Michigan graduate and their COO, to find out more.</p><p><strong>
How did your organization get started, and who was your first customer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govdelivery.com">GovDelivery</a>, Inc. was started in 1999 by our two co-founders, CEO Scott Burns and EVP of Sales Zach Stabenow. &#0160;We developed the GovDelivery Digital Subscription Management system in 2000 in collaboration with the City of St. Paul, who had a need for reliable communication with its residents. &#0160;We found this need to be pervasive across public sector organizations, and it&#39;s taken off quite well from there.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Government web sites are built with all kinds of technologies. &#0160;How do you manage the process so that it all looks the same to the user?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We integrate with client sites by simple links on their web pages. &#0160;The effect is seamless because we customize our web and email templates to match the look-and-feel of each client. &#0160;Behind the scenes GovDelivery is deployed as a multi-tenant, SaaS system, so Ann Arbor is using the same basic application as our other clients.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
The service I signed up for was an email based one. &#0160;What are your plans for looking at web 2.0 technologies for notification, e.g. using something like Twitter to do messaging?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We&#39;re always looking forward to new technologies and applications to our system/market. &#0160;A couple years ago we added RSS capability, so our clients can publish their messages as RSS feeds in addition to sending them out through email. &#0160;We&#39;ve seen a lot of excitement in our market over Web 2.0 technologies, so we&#39;re developing functionality to take advantage of that and promote more options for communication and collaboration between government and citizens. &#0160;A few examples of Web<br />
2.0 notification that we already support include automatically posting messages to blogs, updating a Facebook page, and using public RSS feeds to publish bulletins to widgets.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Do you work with libraries as part of your business, and if so, can you share some good stories from those implementations?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>The majority of our experience has been with government bodies - from small cities and counties up to the largest federal departments - and transit authorities, though we have some experience with education,<br />
non-profits, and other organizations. &#0160;We work with a number of libraries, mainly through city accounts, but the most notable stand-alone library account is the Library of Congress.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
What makes St. Paul a good place to run this business from, and not Silicon Valley or Washington, DC?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>Good business is about good people, and there&#39;s a great pool of talent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. We&#39;re one of the fastest growing software companies in the area, which attracts talented people and helps us to retain and keep them challenged. &#0160;We don&#39;t have the issues that Silicon Valley has where folks are more apt to jump to the next flavor of the day. &#0160;Because of the density of clients in D.C., we do maintain a sales office and staff there, which we plan to grow as the business does.</p><p><strong>
Who do you root for when Michigan plays Minnesota?</strong></p><p>I grew up a Bulldog hockey fan in Duluth - the Gophers were big rivals, so it&#39;s been tough for me to become a fan of any of their teams. &#0160;The real dilemma for me would be if Michigan ever played UMD in hockey.</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks Dave!</p>

   <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
   <p>A
conference of invited presentations is to be held in Ann Arbor on
November 7-9 2008 to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Language
Learning and to explore a paradigm shift currently taking place across
the language sciences, the growing realization of Language as a Complex
Adaptive System.</p>
   <p> Language Learning was first
published from the University of Michigan in 1948. Its subtitle then
was &quot;A Quarterly Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;; indeed the beginnings
of &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; have been attributed to this usage. In the 60
years since, the subtitle has evolved to become &quot;A Journal of Research
in Language Studies&quot; reflecting our mission: </p><blockquote><p>Language Learning is a scientific journal
dedicated to the understanding of language learning broadly defined. It
publishes research articles that systematically apply methods of
inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive
science, educational inquiry, neuroscience, ethnography,
sociolinguistics, sociology, and semiotics. It is concerned with
fundamental theoretical issues in language learning such as child,
second, and foreign language acquisition, language education,
bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain,
culture, cognition, pragmatics, and intergroup relations.</p></blockquote>
   
   <p>The
conference in 2008 will mark our 60th anniversary and our remarkable
success towards these ends. Members of the board, past editors, our
colleagues at Wiley-Blackwell, and friends and confederates in this
enterprise are gathering to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The topic of
the conference is Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent
research across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, and changes over time. However, there is mounting
evidence that processes of language acquisition, use, and change are
not independent from one another but are facets of the same complex
adaptive system. This theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues
from different branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems
(including Clay Beckner, Richard Blythe, Joan Bybee, Morten H.
Christiansen, William Croft, Nick C. Ellis, John Holland, Jinyun Ke,
Diane Larsen-Freeman, and Tom Schoenemann) at a meeting at the Santa Fe
Institute in 2007. &quot;The Five Graces Group&quot; (named after their rather
special accommodations there) are offering a position paper on Language
as a Complex Adaptive System as the introductory piece for the
conference followed by ten individual papers that discuss substantive
areas of language from this perspective. The authors of these ten
papers are active in their recognition of complexity in their
respective areas, ranging from language usage, structure and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing. Discussion of these
papers will be led by members of the board of Language Learning in
order to contextualize these influences within Applied Linguistics and
the Language Sciences more generally.</p>
   <p>Written papers
based on these presentations will form a special issue of the journal
Language Learning (2009, Volume 59, Supplement 1). The proceedings will
also be recorded and later made available through Wiley-Blackwell and
the University of Michigan as a webcast.</p><p>The previous day there&#39;s a seminar on campus:</p><h3><font color="red">Emergence in Physical, Biological, and Social Systems III</font></h3>
<h3>November 7, 2008</h3>
<h3>340 West Hall, University of Michigan</h3>
<h3>9 am-4:30 pm</h3>

<h3>Talks and Poster Session open to the public</h3>
<br />
<p>
Our goal is to help
encourage the formation of a coherent community of researchers on
campus grouped around
the general theme of complexity, emergence, and collective effects.
This third ICAM meeting at the University of Michigan is timed to
connect to the University of Michigan conference on <a href="http://elicorpora.info/LLC/overview">&quot;Language as a Complex Adaptive System&quot;</a> (Nov.8-9, 2008)</p>

      <p>(from the ICOS mailing list)</p><p>Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common<br />
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.</p><p><a href="http://icos.cms.si.umich.edu/sites/icos.cms.si.umich.edu/files/Espeland.pdf">The Discipline of Rankings:

<br /><a href="http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/espeland/home.html">Wendy Espeland 
Northwestern University </a></p><p>This article demonstrates the value of Foucault‟s conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault‟s 
depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings 
change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This 
approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the 
prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the 
external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to 
buffer or hide some activities. Members‟ tendency to internalize these pressures, to 
become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that 
rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and 
by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of 
performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional 
environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a 
crucial task for scholars.

      <p><a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com/2008/10/7-random-food-facts.html">Inspired by Kate from Four Obsessions, here are seven food-related things to share.</a></p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&#0160; If you&#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&#39;ll understand.&#0160; Locally this means that the first day of <a href="http://google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+blueberries">blueberry</a>, raspberry, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/juneberry/">juneberry</a>, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</p><p>2.&#0160; When I was a kid we made cookies out of acorns once.&#0160; It took a long time to gather them, and a lot of work to process them, and when they finally got into the oven somehow (mysteriously) they got scorched.&#0160; I&#39;ve never had the need to repeat that experience.</p><p>3.&#0160; The first complicated recipe I tried was <a href="http://amasci.com/amateur/sciamdx.html">sauce Bearnaise, using a recipe from Scientific American&#39;s The Amateur Scientist (1979 Dec, pg 178; 1981 Jan, pg 164).&#0160;</a>&#0160; It turned out pretty well.</p><p>4.&#0160; After having had <a href="http://williamtozier.com/slurry/2008/09/16/winter-squash-caramel">sweet dumpling squash</a>, I can&#39;t go back to ever eating acorn squash again.</p><p>5.&#0160; We are vegetarians at home, but I&#39;m a confirmed omnivore, and so you&#39;ll see restaurant reviews of meat dishes but only vegetarian recipes.</p><p>6.&#0160; I&#39;m bad at doing recipes because I hardly ever measure anything anymore - mostly I spice things by eye and smell, and as often as not the recipes I end up with are a description of what I did this one time with the food on hand and not instructions for what to go buy.&#0160;&#0160; I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some recipe vocabulary in some language that I&#39;m missing which could make them better, other than &quot;cook until it smells good&quot;.</p><p>7.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken to blogging recipes in part because it&#39;s a convenient way to look them up the next time I need to cook them, since I don&#39;t always know which cookbook on our shelf has the recipe on the menu plan for the week. </p><p>Tag: <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/10/jimmy-wales-gro.html">Jim Benson (e.g. &quot;stir-fried wikipedia with pimentoes&quot;)</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com/2008/02/paczki-day-tomo.html">KitchenChick (my reliable source for Paczki Day information)</a>, and The Cottage Smallholder (who <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=855">got tagged already</a>)</p>

      <p>This is not medical advice; you refer to more trusted sources than blog postings for health care.</p><p>That said, I&#39;m taking some notes to share.</p><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/hfhf.htm">Hand Food and Mouth Disease, from the Center for Disease Control</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with
foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of
cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not
related—they are caused by different viruses. Humans do not get the
animal disease, and animals do not get the human disease.<br /></div><br /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Treatment and Medical Management </strong></h3>
   <ul style="margin-left: 40px;"><li>
     <p> There is no specific treatment for HFMD. </p>
    </li>
<li>
     <p> Symptoms can be treated to provide relief from pain from mouth sores and from fever and aches:     </p>

<pre><code> &lt;ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><li>
       <p> Fever can be treated with antipyretics (drugs that reduce fevers). </p>
      </li>
<li>
        <p> Pain can be treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other over-the-counter pain relievers. </p>
       </li>
<li>
        <p> Mouthwashes or sprays that numb pain can be used to lessen mouth pain. </p>
       </li>
</ul>
    </li>
<li>
Fluid intake should be enough to prevent dehydration (lack of body
fluids). If moderate-to-severe dehydration develops, it can be treated
medically by giving fluids through the veins. </li>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="minusOne">
<p>There is no specific treatment for the infection other than relief of symptoms.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibiotics is not effective, and is not indicated.
Over-the-counter medicines, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) can be used
to treat fever. Aspirin should not be used in viral illnesses in
children under age 12 years.</p>
<p>Salt water mouth rinses (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon of salt to 1 glass of warm
water) may be soothing if the child is able to rinse without
swallowing. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids. Extra fluid is
needed when a fever is present. The best fluids are cold milk products.
Many children refuse juices and sodas because their acid content causes
burning pain in the ulcers.</p>

you will grow as a writer</p><p>When you write it&#39;s hard work - two hours to write a good post about a subdivision or golf course.&#0160; </p><p><strong>What to write about:</strong></p><p><br />* about the communities<br />* about events in the area<br />* about real estate situations<br />* about your market<br />* about a closing<br />* share your listings<br />* answer questions that buyers and sellers ask you<br />* anything and everything<br />* interview people</p><p>Right now there&#39;s a lot of open spaces - you will be found.&#0160;

This approach is particularly useful to understand the day-to-day social and material practices of calculation. Ethnography places the researcher in the same uncertain position as his or her subjects, thereby avoiding the danger of underestimating uncertainty (Agar 1986; Spradley 1979). Its emphasis on practice taps into the actual solutions developed by the users, as opposed to those intended by the designer of the system (Orlikowski 1992; Barley 1986). Our study spans three years of observations at the equity derivatives trading room of pseudonymous International Securities, a large global investment bank with American headquarters on Wall Street. From this period, we selected a single morning of trading at the merger arbitrage desk. The combination of two years of observation with one full morning of data provides a high-frequency, highly contextualized account, in line with the literature in cognitive <br />science and distributed cognition (Hutchins 1995; Hutchins and Klausen 1992).&#0160;&#0160; </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-automark-proble/">Automark problems - how to test, anticipate, and fix</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every year when I vote I use the Automark machines, which are designed for voters needing assistive voting technology at the polls.&nbsp; At my polling place I seem to be the only person who ever uses them, so this is some way to do my bit of public service.</p>

<p>The last few times I have gone through this there have been problems.&nbsp; The first time, I gave up and voted on a regular machine; the second time, I figured things out in time to vote with it.&nbsp; This time I'm going to get it right (I hope).</p>

<p>A recap of problems from previous times:</p>

<p>from May 2008, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">Automark voting issues:</a></p><blockquote><p>I got to the polling place a little bit earlier this time and tried
it again. It misbehaved the same way, but this time there was time to
figure it out, so the poll workers called in their expert who drove
over to help figure it out. The solution ended up to be very simple:
the detachable stub on the ballot must be detached before putting the
ballot into the machine, despite the very clear instructions on that
stub not to detach it, and with no visible instructions to detach it
anywhere on the AutoMARK machine.</p>

<p>I was able to find with some digging an <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ElectionDayGuide_174575_7.pdf">AutoMARK Troubleshooting Guide</a>,
which mentions two possible solutions: either remove the stub before
putting the ballot into the machine, or program the machine to
recognize the stub. I don't know whether this stub length programming
is possible with the ballots we are using.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the ballot has a stub, 
the stub length may not 
have been entered into the 
election setup information.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the system did work with the sample ballot tested by the
poll workers - but the sample ballot did not have a stub at the top! </p></blockquote><p>Listing municipalties that are new to using AutoMARK is a huge catalog - this is just this season's clipping report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/10/21/optical_scan_voting_machines_t.aspx">Centre County, Pennsylvania (Penn State)</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Joyce McKinley, director of elections for Centre County, said voters
shouldn't have any problems with the optical scan machines unless they
overvote or undervote. </p>

<p>Overvoting happens if the voter has chosen more candidates than
allowed, and undervoting is when voters choose fewer candidates than
allowed. In those instances, voters can choose to have the ballot
returned to them or accept the ballot as it is, McKinley said.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/30600929.html">South Bend (St. Joseph County), Indiana (Notre Dame)</a> (WSBT)</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We don't know for sure that those votes are counted,&quot; said Indiana
University-South Bend Political Science Professor Dr. Elizabeth
Bennion. &quot;And, in the case of a close race, it would be very difficult
to do any kind of a recount. So, I think there is real reason for
concern.&quot;</p>

<p>That &quot;touch screen&quot; technology is used to
&quot;automark&quot; specialized ballots filled out by those with special needs
in St. Joseph County. But the actual ballots aren't tallied or counted
until the paper ballot marked by the machine is fed into the same
optical scanner used by all other voters, said St. Joseph County Clerk
Rita Glenn.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyitemoflynn.com/articles/2008/10/06/news/news07.txt">Saugus, MA</a> (The Daily Item, Lynn MA)</p><blockquote><p><span class="content">SAUGUS-This November, the town will once again
set out AutoMARK Voter Assist Terminals at each polling place and, this
time, Town Clerk Joanne Rappa hopes someone other than the poll workers
will use them.<br /><br />AutoMARK terminals allow voters with just about
any kind of handicap to cast their vote unaided in the polling
locations just like every other voter. The problem, Rappa said, is
while the town has had the machines since 2007 no one uses them. She
said she suspects they go unused for one of two reasons, people aren’t
aware the machines are available or don’t know how to use them.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.kxmc.com/News/279909.asp"><span class="content">South Dakota (KXMC via AP)</span></a></p><blockquote><p>YANKTON, S.D. (AP)&nbsp; Secretary of State Chris Nelson says a
problem that cropped up with touch-screen voting machines in the
2006 election won't recur this year.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;States must have at least one touch-screen machine in each
polling place so people with visual or other disabilities can cast
their own ballot in secret.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a class="kxInlineLink" href="http://www.kxmc.com/t/south-dakota" title="Click here to view all related stories">South Dakota</a>'s AutoMARK machines merely mark a paper ballot that
people review after they vote to ensure its accuracy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nelson says there was a problem with the 17-inch-long ballots
that were used in 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This year, the ballots are 14 inches long, and Nelson says the
problem won't happen again.</p></blockquote><p>As always, vote early, and vote often.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-what-exactly-am/">outside.in &#34;top local blog&#34; roundup: what exactly am i writing about here?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>outside.in is a blog aggregator; it scoops up posts from around the net, codes them by geography, and then presents you the reader with a feed that's local to whatever you want it to be local about.&nbsp; <a href="http://outside.in/Ann_Arbor_MI">Here is the outside.in Ann Arbor page</a> .&nbsp; I get their newsletter sent to me which ends up being a good day's local news clippings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outside.in/2008/10/21/dept-of-blogiology-101-ann-arbor/">Here's their roundup of top Ann Arbor blogs and bloggers; Vacuum is listed as a top local blog. </a> They describe what I write about as follows:</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/">Vacuum </a>-
A love of the neighborhood library and awareness of local school news,
political happenings, tech updates and the occasional recipe make this
eclectic blog a must read. </p></blockquote><p>It's always interesting to figure out what other people thing you are doing - if you are trying to maintain a laser-like coherent focus on being eclectic, it's hard to know what to do next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm happy that recipes make for good filler.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, here's perhaps better sources for any of the components that go into this effort:</p>

<p>Libraries: my main library blog is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a> which spun out of Vacuum about two years ago.&nbsp; Locally the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> site has a bunch of blogs inside it including <a href="http://www.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/302">a good one on local history</a>, Globally my short list for library inspiration includes <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">Jenny Levine's The Shifted Librarian</a>, <a href="http://tametheweb.com/">Michael Stephens writing Tame The Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">self-described library geek John Blyberg's eponymous blog.</a></p>

<p>Local school news: the <a href="http://www.burnsparkpto.org/">Burns Park Elementary PTO has a web site and newsletter</a>&nbsp; which I clip from regularly (mostly, it seems, to remind myself of things in the future).&nbsp; The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> has good coverage of school meetings which I am never ever likely to attend regularly.&nbsp; The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arborparents">very busy arborparents mailing list </a>connects parents across town and across the area - more news than I can readily absorb but always something of interest and a very helpful bunch for asking questions of.</p>

<p>Political happenings:&nbsp; I think the outside.in people were keyed on to my elections coverage; rather than take any kind of political stance visibly here at all in any tedious partisan way, I try to always collect <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-michi.html">as much details as I can on elections including sample ballots and polling place locations and times.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The best sources for that are <a href="http://potifos.com/polygon/">county clerk Larry Kestenbaum's occasional blogging</a>, plus a certain degree of digging through municipal web sites.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/services/Pages/E-mailAlertSubscription.aspx">City of Ann Arbor's email alert service</a> helps a lot.</p>

<p>Tech updates: This leaves broad room for interpretation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the useful but sometimes tedious realm, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme is the only tech news tracker you need to listen to the silicon valley echo chamber</a>.&nbsp; Collecting more local tech news is helped by<a href="http://concentratemedia.com/"> Issue Media Group's Concentrate</a> and by <a href="http://www.wwj.com/pages/317228.php">Matt Roush's Great Lakes IT Report</a>, both of which are eager to write about local stuff.&nbsp; My <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 weekly lunch group and the mailing list that goes with it</a> are my local collection source for interesting people and projects and tech (and note that quite a bit of this is pre-market projects not yet in the Silicon Valley radar).</p>

<p>The occasional recipe: The relentlessly practical answer to how this gets done is &quot;blog what you eat&quot;; if you are persistent about that, you get ready-made menu plans for next year around the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, I turn to <a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com">Kate Remen-Wait's Four Obsessions blog</a> when I need a menu idea,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com">Kitchenchick for reviews of local restaurants</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefarmersmarketer.com/">The Farmer's Marketer for a market list from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a>.&nbsp; Globally the technique is &quot;google cooking&quot; or &quot;twitter cooking&quot; where you simply type in a list of ingredients into either search box and hope someone has something inspiring. </p>

<p>Eclectica.&nbsp; It's imporant to be fed a steady diet of things which are interesting; if <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/creativity_is_a.html">creativity is an import-export game</a>, then this is the import side of that.&nbsp; Reliably I pull from<a href="http://delicious.com/network/vielmetti"> my network on delicious</a> for great weird ideas.&nbsp; There are a few weblogs that specialize in the eclectic, most notably <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/">Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets: A Compendium of Eclectica for Epopts.</a></p>

<p>so there you go.</p>

      <p>Some notes from the publisher's sites on new(ish) books on programming a web 2.0 world.&nbsp; Just remember, &quot;every day computers are making people easier and easier to use.&quot;</p>
<p>Programming Collective Intelligence, 1st Edition by Toby Segaran</p>
<blockquote><p>
Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application.

<p>Collective Intelligence in Action, Satnam Alag</p>
<blockquote><p>
Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.

This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.

<p>Algorithms of the Intelligent Web, Haralambos Marmanis with Dmitry Babenko</p>
<blockquote><p>
Web 2.0 applications are best known for providing a rich user experience, but the parts you can't see are just as important—and impressive. Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.

Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.

<p>Of course, if you're going to read code about the intelligent web, it would serve you well to read some fiction first so that you can get your frame of reference right.&nbsp; I'd recommend Snow Crash as a good start.</p>

A leading proponent of open access to all knowledge will consider the<br />
consequences of the consolidation of information into the hands of a few<br />
private organizations when he delivers the keynote lecture at the fourth<br />
John Seely Brown Symposium on Technology and Society, sponsored by U-M's<br />
School of Information.<br />
<br />
<span class="nfakPe">Brewster</span> <span class="nfakPe">Kahle</span>, founder of the Internet Archive and director of the Open<br />
Content Alliance (OCA), has been a critic of proprietary services like<br />
the massive Google Books project, which does not make the books it scans<br />
available to other search services.&nbsp; The project recently scanned its<br />
one-millionth volume from the University of Michigan libraries.<br />
<br />
Following <span class="nfakPe">Kahle</span>'s talk, a panel of experts will comment on <span class="nfakPe">Kahle</span>'s ideas<br />
and discuss the possibilities of &quot;Library 2.0&quot; -- the next generation of<br />
libraries, which will capitalize on all that the digital age has to<br />
offer to benefit patrons, including social networking, 24-hour services,<br />
and user-created content.<br />
<br />
The event is free and open to the public and will be followed by a<br />
public reception.<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-14-scrambled-eggs/">Scrambled eggs with slow roasted tomatoes (炒鸡蛋西红柿)</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I did the slow roasting during high tomato season, and there are a few quarts of them in the freezer.</p>

<p>Wondering which recipes would show up for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=recipe+egg+tomato">a search for &quot;recipe egg tomato&quot; on Twitter</a>, I ended up much to my surprise on a Beijing travel web site, which had a recipe for Fried Egg and Tomato – <a href="http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/chinese-recipes/egg-and-tomato-chinese-recipe">Chǎo Jīdàn Xīhóngshì – 炒鸡蛋西红柿.</a></p><blockquote><p>Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a
really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every
cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing.</p>

<p>It takes about
five minutes to make and is really straightforward. It’s tasty, but
pretty bland, so it’d probably combine nicely with something spicy, a
vegetable dish and plain rice.</p></blockquote><p>Further searches for 炒鸡蛋西红柿 turned up<a href="http://xiaoyao-home.blogspot.com/2008/06/ingredients-onion-eggs-cooking-oil-salt.html"> this bilingual post with several egg+vegetable recipes:</a> </p><blockquote><p><span lang="ZH-CN" style="font-family: SimSun;">This
is not the technical difficulty of the two dishes, and international
friends to write down the invitation because they only know that onions
can be together steak and roast, scrambled eggs can not know. (tr. Google)</span></p></blockquote><p>So then the principles which can be adapted as you might need them based on what is at hand:</p>

<p>Use roughly equal proportions of eggs and tomatoes.&nbsp; I had roasted tomatoes so they weren't so watery, but you could use fresh.</p>

<ol><li>Chop the onion or garlic and mix with the scrambled eggs.&nbsp; Add to a pan with a generous amount of oil and cook.&nbsp; Think &quot;stir fry&quot;, not &quot;omelet&quot; here.</li>

<li>Remove the eggs from the pan and cook the tomatoes (or peas or green beans or what have you) in the same pan.&nbsp; You might add more of whatever seasoning you are using (garlic e.g.).</li>

<li>When the vegetables are cooked and hot, add the eggs back in, mix, season to taste, and serve.&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>With that as a basic start only your imagination is left to add to the possibilities - this would be good with spring peas, zucchini, red peppers just to think of a few.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>some notes for a project that my oldest is doing -</p>

<p><p>from the <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/huntingwildlifehabitat/Landowners_Guide/Species_Mgmt/Bats.htm">Michigan DNR: Landowner&rsquo;s Guide, Bats</a></p><blockquote><p>The <strong> little brown bat</strong> is especially abundant throughout the
state and is the most seen species. A light brown to dark brown in
color, little browns are fairly small in size with a wingspan of 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
to 11 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, small ears, and large feet. In summer, colonies of
the species live in hot attics and under shingles and siding; in
winter, they hibernate in
caves, crevices, houses, hollow trees, or mines. Females form nursery
colonies away from the males. Little brown bats like to feed on aquatic
insects and are frequently seen dipping and diving over water but will
also forage over lawns and pastures, among trees, and under street
lights. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10369-150890--,00.html">DNR: Beneficial Bats Are Nature&rsquo;s Best Bug-Eaters</a></p><blockquote><p></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">There
are in Michigan nine species of bats, and much of what is known about
them comes from studies of the two gregarious (that roost in large
groups) species most commonly found here &ndash; the big brown bat and
little brown bat. Keen&rsquo;s bat is another gregarious species widely
distributed in Michigan, and the tiny eastern pipistrelle is an
uncommon year-round resident of the western Upper Peninsula.</span></span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/wildlife/viewingguide/up/07Bat/index.htm"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">The Millie Mine Bat Viewing Site, Iron Mountain MI</span></span></a></p><blockquote><p>The Millie Mine is a critical hibernating and breeding location for up to 50,000 bats—one of the largest known concentrations of bats in the Midwest. Big brown and little brown bats from all over the region come here to hibernate during the cold winter months. They are believed to migrate in from throughout the Great&nbsp; Lakes region–Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ontario, perhaps even Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Bats start arriving&nbsp; at the mine in late August and early September. They remain in the mine shaft throughout the winter and begin emerging in late April and May. Some use the&nbsp; mine as their permanent home. Most, however, will&nbsp; fly back to their forested home areas to spend the&nbsp; summer where they roost during the day under the bark&nbsp; of dead trees or in other small crevices. The females will typically use large hollow trees, abandoned buildings,&nbsp; or other human structures as maternity roost sites where they raise their young with other females during ; the summer. Males live a separate and more solitary&nbsp; life during this time. </p></blockquote></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ranecurl/mkc/fiborn.html">Fiborn Karst Preserve</a> - a set of limestone caves in an old limestone quarry in Mackinac County, MI:</p><blockquote><p>Both the Little Brown Bat and Keen&rsquo;s
Bat have been found using the caves for swarming or hibernation. Keen&rsquo;s
Bat was most common in the swarming studies. Following the winter of 1978-79
a large number of dead Little Brown Bats were found in Kochab Cave; they
had possibly been trapped by an ice block at the entrance for too long
after they emerged from hibernation. Studies of the bats and other small
mammals are being conducted by scientists from Eastern Michigan University.</p>

<p></p></blockquote><blockquote></p>

<p><p>While the primary significance of the
Fiborn Karst Preserve is geological, the plants and animals of the Preserve
are important components, and their protection is part of the management
objectives. The MKC would welcome further biological studies in the Preserve. </p></blockquote><p>For lots more information, see the <a href="http://www.batcon.org/home/default.asp">Bat Conservation International</a> site.&nbsp; </p><blockquote></blockquote></p>
