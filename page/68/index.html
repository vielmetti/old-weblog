Kroger had a large clock up in view of the checkout lanes with a countdown timer until Christmas, something like this one (except a lot cheaper). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-07-countdown-clocks-only-nn-days-until-christmas/">&raquo;</a></p>

The critics were skeptical:
Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck!
but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-01-baked-polenta-no-stir-polenta-sounds-like-no-water-soup---possible-but-unlikely/">&raquo;</a></p>

Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.

        <p>Recipe credit: freddyknits, who writes about knitting (and importantly takes pictures of projects).
This recipe comes close to what you&#39;ll find as the soup in any of the middle eastern restaurants around town - easy to make (10 minutes chopping at the beginning), forgiving, easy to make in quantity, and sustaining on days when you get the first snow of the season.
You&#39;ll want to keep red lentils in stock in your pantry so that you can always make this soup in a pinch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-27-middle-eastern-lentil-soup/">&raquo;</a></p>

That said, I&#39;m taking some notes to share.
Hand Food and Mouth Disease, from the Center for Disease Control
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not related—they are caused by different viruses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-27-hand-foot-mouth-disease-hfmd---some-facts/">&raquo;</a></p>
