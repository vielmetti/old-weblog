<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-automark-proble/">Automark problems - how to test, anticipate, and fix</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every year when I vote I use the Automark machines, which are designed for voters needing assistive voting technology at the polls.&nbsp; At my polling place I seem to be the only person who ever uses them, so this is some way to do my bit of public service.</p>

<p>The last few times I have gone through this there have been problems.&nbsp; The first time, I gave up and voted on a regular machine; the second time, I figured things out in time to vote with it.&nbsp; This time I'm going to get it right (I hope).</p>

<p>A recap of problems from previous times:</p>

<p>from May 2008, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">Automark voting issues:</a></p><blockquote><p>I got to the polling place a little bit earlier this time and tried
it again. It misbehaved the same way, but this time there was time to
figure it out, so the poll workers called in their expert who drove
over to help figure it out. The solution ended up to be very simple:
the detachable stub on the ballot must be detached before putting the
ballot into the machine, despite the very clear instructions on that
stub not to detach it, and with no visible instructions to detach it
anywhere on the AutoMARK machine.</p>

<p>I was able to find with some digging an <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ElectionDayGuide_174575_7.pdf">AutoMARK Troubleshooting Guide</a>,
which mentions two possible solutions: either remove the stub before
putting the ballot into the machine, or program the machine to
recognize the stub. I don't know whether this stub length programming
is possible with the ballots we are using.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the ballot has a stub, 
the stub length may not 
have been entered into the 
election setup information.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the system did work with the sample ballot tested by the
poll workers - but the sample ballot did not have a stub at the top! </p></blockquote><p>Listing municipalties that are new to using AutoMARK is a huge catalog - this is just this season's clipping report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/10/21/optical_scan_voting_machines_t.aspx">Centre County, Pennsylvania (Penn State)</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Joyce McKinley, director of elections for Centre County, said voters
shouldn't have any problems with the optical scan machines unless they
overvote or undervote. </p>

<p>Overvoting happens if the voter has chosen more candidates than
allowed, and undervoting is when voters choose fewer candidates than
allowed. In those instances, voters can choose to have the ballot
returned to them or accept the ballot as it is, McKinley said.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/30600929.html">South Bend (St. Joseph County), Indiana (Notre Dame)</a> (WSBT)</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We don't know for sure that those votes are counted,&quot; said Indiana
University-South Bend Political Science Professor Dr. Elizabeth
Bennion. &quot;And, in the case of a close race, it would be very difficult
to do any kind of a recount. So, I think there is real reason for
concern.&quot;</p>

<p>That &quot;touch screen&quot; technology is used to
&quot;automark&quot; specialized ballots filled out by those with special needs
in St. Joseph County. But the actual ballots aren't tallied or counted
until the paper ballot marked by the machine is fed into the same
optical scanner used by all other voters, said St. Joseph County Clerk
Rita Glenn.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyitemoflynn.com/articles/2008/10/06/news/news07.txt">Saugus, MA</a> (The Daily Item, Lynn MA)</p><blockquote><p><span class="content">SAUGUS-This November, the town will once again
set out AutoMARK Voter Assist Terminals at each polling place and, this
time, Town Clerk Joanne Rappa hopes someone other than the poll workers
will use them.<br /><br />AutoMARK terminals allow voters with just about
any kind of handicap to cast their vote unaided in the polling
locations just like every other voter. The problem, Rappa said, is
while the town has had the machines since 2007 no one uses them. She
said she suspects they go unused for one of two reasons, people aren’t
aware the machines are available or don’t know how to use them.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.kxmc.com/News/279909.asp"><span class="content">South Dakota (KXMC via AP)</span></a></p><blockquote><p>YANKTON, S.D. (AP)&nbsp; Secretary of State Chris Nelson says a
problem that cropped up with touch-screen voting machines in the
2006 election won't recur this year.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;States must have at least one touch-screen machine in each
polling place so people with visual or other disabilities can cast
their own ballot in secret.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a class="kxInlineLink" href="http://www.kxmc.com/t/south-dakota" title="Click here to view all related stories">South Dakota</a>'s AutoMARK machines merely mark a paper ballot that
people review after they vote to ensure its accuracy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nelson says there was a problem with the 17-inch-long ballots
that were used in 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This year, the ballots are 14 inches long, and Nelson says the
problem won't happen again.</p></blockquote><p>As always, vote early, and vote often.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-what-exactly-am/">outside.in &#34;top local blog&#34; roundup: what exactly am i writing about here?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>outside.in is a blog aggregator; it scoops up posts from around the net, codes them by geography, and then presents you the reader with a feed that's local to whatever you want it to be local about.&nbsp; <a href="http://outside.in/Ann_Arbor_MI">Here is the outside.in Ann Arbor page</a> .&nbsp; I get their newsletter sent to me which ends up being a good day's local news clippings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outside.in/2008/10/21/dept-of-blogiology-101-ann-arbor/">Here's their roundup of top Ann Arbor blogs and bloggers; Vacuum is listed as a top local blog. </a> They describe what I write about as follows:</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/">Vacuum </a>-
A love of the neighborhood library and awareness of local school news,
political happenings, tech updates and the occasional recipe make this
eclectic blog a must read. </p></blockquote><p>It's always interesting to figure out what other people thing you are doing - if you are trying to maintain a laser-like coherent focus on being eclectic, it's hard to know what to do next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm happy that recipes make for good filler.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, here's perhaps better sources for any of the components that go into this effort:</p>

<p>Libraries: my main library blog is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a> which spun out of Vacuum about two years ago.&nbsp; Locally the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> site has a bunch of blogs inside it including <a href="http://www.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/302">a good one on local history</a>, Globally my short list for library inspiration includes <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">Jenny Levine's The Shifted Librarian</a>, <a href="http://tametheweb.com/">Michael Stephens writing Tame The Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">self-described library geek John Blyberg's eponymous blog.</a></p>

<p>Local school news: the <a href="http://www.burnsparkpto.org/">Burns Park Elementary PTO has a web site and newsletter</a>&nbsp; which I clip from regularly (mostly, it seems, to remind myself of things in the future).&nbsp; The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> has good coverage of school meetings which I am never ever likely to attend regularly.&nbsp; The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arborparents">very busy arborparents mailing list </a>connects parents across town and across the area - more news than I can readily absorb but always something of interest and a very helpful bunch for asking questions of.</p>

<p>Political happenings:&nbsp; I think the outside.in people were keyed on to my elections coverage; rather than take any kind of political stance visibly here at all in any tedious partisan way, I try to always collect <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-michi.html">as much details as I can on elections including sample ballots and polling place locations and times.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The best sources for that are <a href="http://potifos.com/polygon/">county clerk Larry Kestenbaum's occasional blogging</a>, plus a certain degree of digging through municipal web sites.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/services/Pages/E-mailAlertSubscription.aspx">City of Ann Arbor's email alert service</a> helps a lot.</p>

<p>Tech updates: This leaves broad room for interpretation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the useful but sometimes tedious realm, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme is the only tech news tracker you need to listen to the silicon valley echo chamber</a>.&nbsp; Collecting more local tech news is helped by<a href="http://concentratemedia.com/"> Issue Media Group's Concentrate</a> and by <a href="http://www.wwj.com/pages/317228.php">Matt Roush's Great Lakes IT Report</a>, both of which are eager to write about local stuff.&nbsp; My <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 weekly lunch group and the mailing list that goes with it</a> are my local collection source for interesting people and projects and tech (and note that quite a bit of this is pre-market projects not yet in the Silicon Valley radar).</p>

<p>The occasional recipe: The relentlessly practical answer to how this gets done is &quot;blog what you eat&quot;; if you are persistent about that, you get ready-made menu plans for next year around the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, I turn to <a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com">Kate Remen-Wait's Four Obsessions blog</a> when I need a menu idea,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com">Kitchenchick for reviews of local restaurants</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefarmersmarketer.com/">The Farmer's Marketer for a market list from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a>.&nbsp; Globally the technique is &quot;google cooking&quot; or &quot;twitter cooking&quot; where you simply type in a list of ingredients into either search box and hope someone has something inspiring. </p>

<p>Eclectica.&nbsp; It's imporant to be fed a steady diet of things which are interesting; if <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/creativity_is_a.html">creativity is an import-export game</a>, then this is the import side of that.&nbsp; Reliably I pull from<a href="http://delicious.com/network/vielmetti"> my network on delicious</a> for great weird ideas.&nbsp; There are a few weblogs that specialize in the eclectic, most notably <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/">Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets: A Compendium of Eclectica for Epopts.</a></p>

<p>so there you go.</p>

      <p>Some notes from the publisher's sites on new(ish) books on programming a web 2.0 world.&nbsp; Just remember, &quot;every day computers are making people easier and easier to use.&quot;</p>
<p>Programming Collective Intelligence, 1st Edition by Toby Segaran</p>
<blockquote><p>
Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application.

<p>Collective Intelligence in Action, Satnam Alag</p>
<blockquote><p>
Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.

This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.

<p>Algorithms of the Intelligent Web, Haralambos Marmanis with Dmitry Babenko</p>
<blockquote><p>
Web 2.0 applications are best known for providing a rich user experience, but the parts you can't see are just as important—and impressive. Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.

Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This one isn't actually in print yet; <a href="http://www.manning.com/marmanis/">from the publisher's site you can buy the advance electronic reading copy.</a></p>
<p>Of course, if you're going to read code about the intelligent web, it would serve you well to read some fiction first so that you can get your frame of reference right.&nbsp; I'd recommend Snow Crash as a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-14-scrambled-eggs/">Scrambled eggs with slow roasted tomatoes (炒鸡蛋西红柿)</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I did the slow roasting during high tomato season, and there are a few quarts of them in the freezer.</p>

<p>Wondering which recipes would show up for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=recipe+egg+tomato">a search for &quot;recipe egg tomato&quot; on Twitter</a>, I ended up much to my surprise on a Beijing travel web site, which had a recipe for Fried Egg and Tomato – <a href="http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/chinese-recipes/egg-and-tomato-chinese-recipe">Chǎo Jīdàn Xīhóngshì – 炒鸡蛋西红柿.</a></p><blockquote><p>Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a
really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every
cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing.</p>

<p>It takes about
five minutes to make and is really straightforward. It’s tasty, but
pretty bland, so it’d probably combine nicely with something spicy, a
vegetable dish and plain rice.</p></blockquote><p>Further searches for 炒鸡蛋西红柿 turned up<a href="http://xiaoyao-home.blogspot.com/2008/06/ingredients-onion-eggs-cooking-oil-salt.html"> this bilingual post with several egg+vegetable recipes:</a> </p><blockquote><p><span lang="ZH-CN" style="font-family: SimSun;">This
is not the technical difficulty of the two dishes, and international
friends to write down the invitation because they only know that onions
can be together steak and roast, scrambled eggs can not know. (tr. Google)</span></p></blockquote><p>So then the principles which can be adapted as you might need them based on what is at hand:</p>

<p>Use roughly equal proportions of eggs and tomatoes.&nbsp; I had roasted tomatoes so they weren't so watery, but you could use fresh.</p>

<ol><li>Chop the onion or garlic and mix with the scrambled eggs.&nbsp; Add to a pan with a generous amount of oil and cook.&nbsp; Think &quot;stir fry&quot;, not &quot;omelet&quot; here.</li>

<li>Remove the eggs from the pan and cook the tomatoes (or peas or green beans or what have you) in the same pan.&nbsp; You might add more of whatever seasoning you are using (garlic e.g.).</li>

<li>When the vegetables are cooked and hot, add the eggs back in, mix, season to taste, and serve.&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>With that as a basic start only your imagination is left to add to the possibilities - this would be good with spring peas, zucchini, red peppers just to think of a few.</p>

<p>--</p>

      </h3>
      <p>some notes for a project that my oldest is doing -</p>

<p><p>from the <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/huntingwildlifehabitat/Landowners_Guide/Species_Mgmt/Bats.htm">Michigan DNR: Landowner&rsquo;s Guide, Bats</a></p><blockquote><p>The <strong> little brown bat</strong> is especially abundant throughout the
state and is the most seen species. A light brown to dark brown in
color, little browns are fairly small in size with a wingspan of 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
to 11 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches, small ears, and large feet. In summer, colonies of
the species live in hot attics and under shingles and siding; in
winter, they hibernate in
caves, crevices, houses, hollow trees, or mines. Females form nursery
colonies away from the males. Little brown bats like to feed on aquatic
insects and are frequently seen dipping and diving over water but will
also forage over lawns and pastures, among trees, and under street
lights. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10369-150890--,00.html">DNR: Beneficial Bats Are Nature&rsquo;s Best Bug-Eaters</a></p><blockquote><p></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">There
are in Michigan nine species of bats, and much of what is known about
them comes from studies of the two gregarious (that roost in large
groups) species most commonly found here &ndash; the big brown bat and
little brown bat. Keen&rsquo;s bat is another gregarious species widely
distributed in Michigan, and the tiny eastern pipistrelle is an
uncommon year-round resident of the western Upper Peninsula.</span></span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/publications/pdfs/wildlife/viewingguide/up/07Bat/index.htm"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="color: BLACK;">The Millie Mine Bat Viewing Site, Iron Mountain MI</span></span></a></p><blockquote><p>The Millie Mine is a critical hibernating and breeding location for up to 50,000 bats—one of the largest known concentrations of bats in the Midwest. Big brown and little brown bats from all over the region come here to hibernate during the cold winter months. They are believed to migrate in from throughout the Great&nbsp; Lakes region–Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ontario, perhaps even Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Bats start arriving&nbsp; at the mine in late August and early September. They remain in the mine shaft throughout the winter and begin emerging in late April and May. Some use the&nbsp; mine as their permanent home. Most, however, will&nbsp; fly back to their forested home areas to spend the&nbsp; summer where they roost during the day under the bark&nbsp; of dead trees or in other small crevices. The females will typically use large hollow trees, abandoned buildings,&nbsp; or other human structures as maternity roost sites where they raise their young with other females during ; the summer. Males live a separate and more solitary&nbsp; life during this time. </p></blockquote></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ranecurl/mkc/fiborn.html">Fiborn Karst Preserve</a> - a set of limestone caves in an old limestone quarry in Mackinac County, MI:</p><blockquote><p>Both the Little Brown Bat and Keen&rsquo;s
Bat have been found using the caves for swarming or hibernation. Keen&rsquo;s
Bat was most common in the swarming studies. Following the winter of 1978-79
a large number of dead Little Brown Bats were found in Kochab Cave; they
had possibly been trapped by an ice block at the entrance for too long
after they emerged from hibernation. Studies of the bats and other small
mammals are being conducted by scientists from Eastern Michigan University.</p>

<p></p></blockquote><blockquote></p>

<p><p>While the primary significance of the
Fiborn Karst Preserve is geological, the plants and animals of the Preserve
are important components, and their protection is part of the management
objectives. The MKC would welcome further biological studies in the Preserve. </p></blockquote><p>For lots more information, see the <a href="http://www.batcon.org/home/default.asp">Bat Conservation International</a> site.&nbsp; </p><blockquote></blockquote></p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~refromsn/tv.html">&quot;Kill your television.&quot;</a>&nbsp; Quoting Robert Efroymson's long since abandoned home page at U Minnesota:</p><blockquote><p>My favorite reason for not watching TV is that it has a fixed, low
bandwidth.&nbsp; You can't watch tv fast or slow, you have to watch it at
the rate the show goes, which could very well be much slower than you
can accept the information (or much faster).&nbsp; A book you can read at
your own pace, a tv show sets the pace for you.
</p>

<p>
The other reason is that I will watch anything.&nbsp; I seem to have no
ability to discriminate between good shows and bad.&nbsp; I learned this
many years ago, when I was an undergraduate.&nbsp; I was visiting some
relatives who had young children.&nbsp; They put a tape of the &quot;Smurfs&quot; in
the VCR for the girls to watch.&nbsp; I could not help watching it myslf.
In fact I can still recall the evil man with his cat who had a plan to
destroy the Smurfs. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-08-twitter-zero/">twitter zero</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I love Twitter - I love being in the flow of the world with the off hand comments of hundreds of friends around the world triggering all sorts of warm feelings and thoughts about how lucky I am to know so many people in so many places.</p>

<p>For that very same reason, I&#39;m working towards getting off Twitter, my &quot;twitter zero&quot; project, where I unfollow everyone I&#39;ve been following.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Twitter Zero is inspired by a few other &quot;zero&quot; projects, including Merlin Mann&#39;s &quot;Inbox Zero&quot; and Alan Gutierrez&#39;s &quot;Reader Zero&quot;.&#0160; The basic idea is that in systems where there is an infinite capacity for the world to send messages to get your attention, the only reasonable queue that you can leave between visits to the system is zero, because if you get behind you will never, ever, ever catch up gradually.&#0160; Never.&#0160; No matter how much time you put into it, there will always be more to do, and you will lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that you say, you love twitter, why make it go away?&#0160; For the same reason that I love weblogs (really I do; you are reading this one) and I don&#39;t read any blogs in a feed reader.&#0160; And I love getting email (really I do) and spend too much of my time ignoring and deleting email.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t keep up.&#0160; No one can keep up, actually - we look at something shiny and say &quot;ooh shiny&quot; and start following it because it was shiny then (and shiny once) and then suddenly you look back a week later and note to self &quot;hm, not shiny any more, but it&#39;s a lot harder to stop paying attention to it once you&#39;re connected to it&quot;.</p>

<p>So, go to zero.&#0160; Turn off Twitter, don&#39;t let it interrupt you any more.&#0160; But still listen.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Twitter is great for ambience awareness of things around the world, perfect actually.&#0160; With the new search interface you can see at a glance when there are earthquakes, what television shows are on, who&#39;s winning what football games, when the Mormon Church is having a global conference, Girl&#39;s Night Out, you name it there&#39;s some super-cool global event that you can tap into without doing much more than a few follows.</p>

<p>Follow follow follow follow...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll argue for the sake of arguing that we as human beings have a finite supply of attention for ambient awareness of things around the world; there&#39;s only so many neurons that can fire in one moment to keep track of what&#39;s happening, and my poor aging brain has some finite ability to keep track. You make tradeoffs, you have to.&#0160; And the fact that I know just a little bit too much about popular television due to twitter has to be responsible for some other deficit in my life, like not getting quite enough sleep, or not cleaning the garage (or even more to the point noticing that there are parts of it that need attention).&#0160; </p>

<p>Or paying attention to my boys.&#0160; They are little.&#0160; They won&#39;t be little forever.&#0160; They don&#39;t use Twitter, yet - yet? - though the older one was asking about connections between the computer and my phone (he seemed to think that Bluetooth would be involved.&#0160; he&#39;s eight.&#0160; how do they do this?)</p>

<p>Attention is a precious resource.&#0160; Twitter is a distraction.&#0160; Email is a distraction.&#0160; This blog is a distraction.&#0160; Pretty much everything is a distraction on the Internet, either designed to capture an eyeball or rewire a neuron or to short circuit the brain to wallet function.&#0160; And sometimes the only reasonable response to a thoroughly enjoyable distraction is to make a very visible, very annoying, very painful decision to skip this particular distraction and move on.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Before inbox zero, before twitter zero, there was Usenet Zero.&#0160; &#0160;One by one, a series of people who had spent a lot of time building up that network made decisions, some private and some noisily public, to give up on that network and go off and build some other network of their own.</p>

<p>Noisy public exits are cathartic - they let you say something that has been building up over time and get it all out of your system, and rather than try to fight the fight of 1000 tiny cuts you simply say &quot;screw it&quot; and let off some steam and disentangle from the world you had been in all at once.&#0160; You go away in a ball of fire and are memorable for your absence, at least for a little while, at least until someone else&#39;s attention span is diverted momentarily into the latest minor earthquake or Digg headline or caribou joke or heart attack rumor.</p>

<p>Giving up on a network is one way to build a new network.&#0160; Who notices when you go?&#0160; Who actually cares?&#0160; Exit stage left (in flames) is more effective at some momentary attention grab than simply quietly receding into the background.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;m giving up on Twitter feeds, I&#39;m not really giving up on Twitter.&#0160; There&#39;s too much there to ignore.&#0160; But I&#39;m changing my approach.</p>

<p>Rather than the passive rat-lever-pellet approach to waiting for an update from a Twitter pal, I&#39;m going to be using the Twitter search tools as the primary point of contact.&#0160; &#0160; This is the &quot;Kibo&quot; strategy.</p>

<p>Kibo?</p>

<p>If you were on Usenet at a certain time, there was someone called Kibo, who was virtually everywhere.&#0160; Every newsgroup you posted in, if someone mentioned his name, he showed up with a comment.&#0160; That was unusual, because who could follow 1400 newsgroups and read everything.&#0160; </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not how Kibo did it, and not how I did the same thing when I ran the Usenet newsgroup comp.archives.&#0160; Instead of following the network by group, you follow it by keyword, and anyone who uses that word or set of words is part of your world.&#0160; For comp.archives, it meant that every time someone typed in the word FTP, I&#39;d find that post, and one time out of ten those were announcements of new software.&#0160; A systematic effort to collect those announcements and repost them and index them followed.</p>

<p>That was hard in the Usenet era (I ended up hacking on emacs lisp to do it) but very easy in the Twitter era, and it&#39;s a better strategy by far.&#0160; If you want to change the things you focus on, you don&#39;t need to add and subtract friends, you just need to modulate your filters.</p>

And maybe that&#39;s the answer: A Facebook app we&#39;ll call the Fade Utility. Untended Friends would gradually display a sepia cast on the picture, a blurring of the neglected profile—perhaps a coffee stain might appear on it or an unrelated phone number or grocery list. The individual&#39;s status updates might fade and get smaller. The user may then choose to notice and reach out to the person in some meaningful way—no pokes! Or they might pretend not to notice. Without making a choice, they could simply let that person go. Would that really be so awful?

<p><p>The World Spider Catalog is a thorough catalog of the scientific literature regarding spiders, with a special attention paid to classification and taxonomy.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The organization of the entries is hierarchically determined; hence synonymies at the
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic level are indicated under the family (and cross-referenced under the appropriate
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic) listings, but affected species are listed separately only if there are significant
&nbsp; &nbsp; references to them in particular. Similarly, synonymies at the species level are listed under
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic, rather than familial, headings. Unlike Roewer and Brignoli, I have not attempted to
&nbsp; &nbsp; segregate species within large genera on a geographic basis. Their listings are often
&nbsp; &nbsp; confusing, with widespread species being hard to locate and easy to overlook. Spider
&nbsp; &nbsp; systematics has suffered too much from narrow regionalism to encourage strictly faunistic
&nbsp; &nbsp; approaches in any way! The brief descriptions of geographic ranges are provided only as a
&nbsp; &nbsp; general guide; no attempt has been made to ensure that they are comprehensive.</p></blockquote><p>Cataloging the world&rsquo;s spiders is hard work, and <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/COUNTS.html">this collection lists (at the current reading) 3694 genera and 40462 species.&nbsp; </a>Unsurprisingly, then, you&rsquo;ll need to go elsewhere for pictures and descriptions, but the <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/BIBLIO.html">exhaustively complete bibliography going back to 1757 will get you started.</a>&nbsp; 1757?&nbsp; Yes, 1757.&nbsp; The oldest spider so cataloged is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivantortuga/2401539306/">Salticus scenicus, which is pictured here (photo IvanTortuga), the zebra spider</a><br />The cite is </p><blockquote><p>Clerck, C. Svenska spindlar, uti sina hufvud-slågter indelte samt under några och sextio särskildte arter beskrefne och med illuminerade figurer uplyste. Stockholmiae, 154 pp.</p></blockquote><p>A researcher in the field of spider ecology notes that the presence of such detailed taxonomic bibliographies has greatly influenced spider taxonomic work, even when similar pre-electronic spider ecology work has been largely forgotten.&nbsp; From <a href="http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1636%2F0161-8202(2005)033[0826%3ATEOMEI]2.0.CO%3B2">James Bell, THE EMERGENCE OF MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENTS IN ECOLOGICAL SPIDER RESEARCH (1684–1973)</a> </p><blockquote><p class="first-child">In this review, the aim is to trace the early
advances in spider ecology to individual authors who were instrumental
in shaping our current understanding of ecology as a modern science.
The motivation for this paper is to reveal to the ecological community
some of the best early research in the first half of the 20th century
when it is believed that ecological spider experiments really began.
This period has remained elusive to most researchers, because the
majority of ecological literature pre-1970 is not available
electronically and ecological research tends to have a short citation
life-time which rarely extends beyond a decade. For example, there are
two excellent, but very similar experiments on orientation in <a href="http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=all&amp;search_value=Frontinella+communis&amp;search_kingdom=every&amp;search_span=exactly_for&amp;categories=All&amp;source=html&amp;search_credRating=All" target="itis_window"><em>Frontinella communis</em></a> (Hentz 1850) (Linyphiidae).

or those who did the peer review and editing, simply because the
reference was not in general electronic circulation (Robert Suter pers.
comm.). This is not especially embarrassing because for most authors
there has rarely been a need to look deep into the scientific
literature—in fact, ecological journals positively discourage it.</p></blockquote><p>Platnick, N. I. 2008. The world spider catalog, version 9.0. American Museum of Natural

friendly household appliances, including a beautiful egg whisk and the
alarm clock that loves her. Veteran costume designer and Monty Python
movie alum James Acheson had a hand in designing the opening chorus of
six evil vacuum cleaners. The chorus is joined by a 15&rsquo; giant evil
vacuum cleaner, who — with the help of an inflatable body, a fan, and
some CO2 — literally bursts with pride, showering dust and bed bugs over the orchestra and the first few rows of the audience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7180000/newsid_7184500/7184582.stm">The BBC has a video with a Terry Jones interview and some of the dancing vacuums</a> (sorry, can&rsquo;t embed it).</p><blockquote><p>Opera singers appear as giant appliances in Monty Python creator Terry

      </h3>
      <p>in some extremely silly world, here are practical ways to get dressed for Halloween as a vacuum cleaner with attachments.<br /><a href="http://www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com/original-halloween-costumes.html"><br />From &quot;coolest homemade costumes dot com&quot; in their home appliances section:</a></p><blockquote><p>My husband started with an empty box, free from the grocery store
and cut it down to fit her. He then wrapped it in some black vinyl,
attached some parts from old vacuums we had in the garage (handle, hose
and attachment, caddy with brushes). The red Hoover emblem was a piece
of red sticky-backed felt. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The feet (power head) were two
pieces of 4&quot; foam hollowed out, one on each foot for movement. We
decorated them with more red felt displaying 12 amps and aluminum foil
for a headlight. While trick or treating so many people asked her to
clean their houses for fun! </p></blockquote>

this costume gets its full shape from newspaper stuffing, while foam
core is used to make the sweeper. Toilet paper rolls painted black and
attached to a knit cap create the handle, and a black cord is the final
touch to the wearable appliance.
</p></blockquote><p>Finally, here's a twist I hadn't expected: rather than you dressing as a vacuum, dress your vacuum (in this case the Roomba robot vacuum) in <a href="http://myroombud.com/roombafrogger.html">a Frogger costume from myRoomBud.</a> </p>

The video commentary:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">Ever
since Phillip Torrone
and Limor Fried played
Roomba Frogger down in
Texas, we wanted to play
it too except we could
not afford to use one
of our Roombas &hellip; so
we hacked a Frogger game
to use one our RoomBud
costume characters, Roobit
the Frog. Well that wasn&rsquo;t
good enough so using a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=3&amp;idproduct=1">RooTooth</a>
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/">RoombaDevTools</a>
for the wireless bluetooth
connection to our computer
and a bit more coding,
we put together a game
that we can play on the
computer and have Roobit
the Frog RoomBud actually
run along the floor doing
the same maneuvers as
the Frogger character.
When you get your little
Roobit across the river,
your Roomba will start
to vacuum!</span></p></blockquote></p>

      </h3>
      <p>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.newsagencyblog.com.au/2008/10/03/calendar-strategy-delivers-results.html">Australian Newsagency Blog<br /><br /></a></p><blockquote><p>Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston.</p>

<p>At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season.</p>

<p>At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously
this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on
a more unique range of titles. We have given over a column at the front
of the store to promote our calendar range as well as to feature a <strong>Calendar of the Week</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually when people talk about a &quot;calendar of the week&quot;, they talk about &quot;a calendar of the next week's events&quot;.&nbsp; Here, we have &quot;an entirely new calendar of the year, so that if you gave up on last week's calendar because you got bored of seeing pictures of fuzzy bunnies, here's a new one of fuzzy kittens.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every week on Thursday I host a lunch at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor; you're invited.&nbsp; One regular element of that lunch is helping figure out what events are happening the upcoming weekend and weeks ahead so that people can find help in publicizing those events or tell people about something they are looking forward to.</p>

<p>I've tried a zillion difficult ways to keep the calendar for that group, none of which are ideal, mostly because they involve some kind of calendar system which requires more precision than I have time to deal with and which makes me type things into fields.</p>

<p>The hack (and really it's a hack) for the last few weeks has been to use <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Talk:A2b3">the talk page on the group's page on Arborwiki as a public calendar, </a>or more precisely, to use it for me as a quick place to cut and paste things so that when the time comes I know enough to tell people about that.&nbsp; An interesting advantage to doing it in wiki vs. in a calendar system is that I can hyperlink e.g. the name of a theater to the page for that theater and get (for free) all of the location and venue information along with it.</p>

<p>Is it perfect?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is there some refinement of it which might work better?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Is it handy?&nbsp; You bet.</p>

      <p>I wrote up a list of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/ten_places_to_h.html">ten places to have a birthday party for kids in Ann Arbor</a> about a year ago; it's proven to be a popular post.&nbsp; I thought I'd do a new list completely different from the first.&nbsp; As always check for availability and pricing before you plan.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Frisinger_Park">Frisinger Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A few picnic tables near the playground with lots of things to do for
kids (slides, swings, a merry-go-round, a sandbox) and a big field to run in. Shady for
those hot days. Avoid it on football Saturdays. Free.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Gallup_Park">Gallup Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A dock on the Huron River is perfect for a party where the kids go fishing. (worms work great).&nbsp; There's a snack bar with coffee for the adults, and a play area with lots of things to climb and bounce on.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; Get your fishing license online with the <a href="http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp">Michigan DNR E-License.</a></p>

<p>3.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.exhibits.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/publicprogrms/planetarium/">Exhibit Museum Planetarium</a> (indoors).&nbsp; They're closed as of this writing, preparing to install a new all-digital projection system; sign up for their mailing list to find out more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>4.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_Firehouse_Museum">Michigan Firehouse Museum</a>, Ypsilanti (indoors).&nbsp; Old fire engines are the draw in this museum located in an old fire house near Ypsi's Depot Town.&nbsp; </p>

<p>5.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jiffy_Mix">Jiffy Mix factory tour</a>, Chelsea (indoors).&nbsp; Tour the factory, see how Jiffy Mix is made.&nbsp; Age 6 and up, tours Mon-Fri, so it's probably a summer time event or a holiday event.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Southern_Michigan_Railroad_Society">Southern Michigan Railroad Society,</a> Clinton MI.&nbsp; Museum train runs from Clinton to Tecumseh on the old Jacksonburgh and Palymra track; there's a museum in Clinton with old railroad stuff on the main floor and a working shop downstairs for repair of their rolling stock.&nbsp; Call them to see how they handle groups.</p>
