<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

The concentrated light then illuminates any subject in that spot from all sides, making a very bright yet diffuse light. This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography. So, how about if I design one that will catch most of the light from my on-camera flash, and direct the bulk of it into the relatively small volume that I actually want to illuminate?</p>

      <blockquote><p>Rankings, an ordinal list, can result from tests or from contests. Start with contests, and take first the forms in which competitors play against each other. The score in such a contest indicates which player (team) performed better (earned more runs or goals, ran faster, jumped higher) against another or others on a given day. The score of a soccer match is the result of a direct, head to head competition.&nbsp; And the aggregation of these scores (in, for example, win-loss records) results in rankings – whether it be a soccer league or of all the professional tennis players or of all the Grand Master chess players in the world.&nbsp; Note that in such contests there are referees and timekeepers but not judges. Technology contests (e.g., solving the problem of determining latitude on the open sea, building the fastest computer, the lightest airplane, robotic cars on ever-more challenging terrain) operate according to similar principles.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>That&#39;s a question I often pose at the beginning of projects, and one that I struggle with often when there is no simple answer.&#0160; Some reflection has me thinking it might be too simple a question to pose when goals are complex and long term and emergent.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll illustrate with a project that by some multiple measures has been successful so far, my weekly lunch meeting called a2b3.&#0160; Every week we gather for lunch, people eat, they talk, they leave.&#0160; At various times I&#39;ve tried to determine what to tally up to see if I&#39;m doing the right thing, and no number that I make visible ever holds up to repeated fixation.&#0160;</p>
<p>How do you measure success of a weekly meeting?&#0160; There&#39;s one simple measure of attendance, though we have filled the restaurant and don&#39;t plan to move so there&#39;s no real way to grow beyond the 20 to 30 or so that are normally there.&#0160; When on the odd week that there&#39;s a low turnout of 15 the lunch is so different and enjoyable that that feels like success too.&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself counting the number of people who are long time regulars, and also counting the number of people who are new.&#0160; Both seem like good people to have.&#0160; It can take a while to meet someone new until there&#39;s some other good connection, so my ability to add people to my world seems fixed - if the whole group was either people I already knew or people I didn&#39;t know that would be a challenge.</p>
<p>I also count the message traffic on the mailing list. &#0160;Email lists have some amount of channel capacity, so you want to have the list be busy enough to occupy the channel but not so busy that they cause people to turn it off or so idle that people forget it&#39;s there.</p>
<p>There is a degree of diversity to the group that surprises me, and what&#39;s more it surprises me that I don&#39;t need to do deliberate recruiting of anyone in order to get the occasional undergraduate or high school student or person from out of town or other demographic outlier to arrive.&#0160; It&#39;s perhaps because I don&#39;t keep track that makes it possible to be pleasantly surprised by how it feels like a broad cross-section of a corner of town.</p>
<p><strong>One easy measure of success is how well the group self-organizes when I&#39;m not there.&#0160;</strong>Some part of years of what might retrospectively be considered thoughtful planning is some zen quality of not needing to plan very much at all. &#0160;When I&#39;m not there, something still happens.</p>
<p>Traditional &quot;economic development&quot; organizations crow about their ability to attract or retain jobs, the number of events they organize, the value of square inches of favorable newsprint copy in ad-equivalent dollars, or the square feet of real estate they helped cause to be occupied. Those are all useful measurements when you&#39;re spending tax dollars, so that people doing accounting can have something to count. &#0160;But if all you are spending is lunch money, you better have a way to count on goodwill building up over time - credit toward some future, rather than a precise reckoning of the present.</p>

      <p>Copied in its entirety from the <a href="http://www.icgov.org/default/?id=1696">Iowa, City IA city government</a> web page in their "Public Art" section.</p>

<p><strong>King-Littrell-Palmer Chicken Hatchery</strong></p>
<p><img  alt="The Hatchery" class="border " height="157" src="http://www.icgov.org/site/CMSv2/image/publicArt/klpchickenhatchery.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;" width="250" />Irving King, head of the University of Iowa Department of Literature, had an unusual sideline for an English professor: raising chickens. In 1918, King started a hatchery as a hobby on the south side of Jackson Avenue. Eventually, the hatchery occupied several wood structures from Sheridan
Avenue to Ralston Creek between the alley and Rundell Street. Fittingly, King's protégé in the poultry business was a poet: Ralph Littrell, who had a bachelor's degree from Iowa State University. By 1940, Littrell was the hatchery's owner and operator. At about the same time, a local builder named Lloyd Palmer bought the King home at 903 Dearborn Street from King's widow. Palmer, another hobbyist, ran a hatchery in the brick building west of the house until 1946.</p>
<p>Local residents bought dressed chickens and eggs here or from one of the many small neighborhood groceries that this hatchery supplied. Farmers came to buy live chickens. Chickens were sent by overnight train to Denver, and biweekly trucks would carry eggs to Chicago. Schoolteachers brought their classes to see the chicks, and the office was a popular place for neighbors to gather for conversation.</p>
<p>At one time, Iowa City had several hatcheries. Littrell's hatchery was the last one in town when it closed in 1986.</p>

<p>Iowa City is in the middle of an urban chicken imbroglio; here's a <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990928003">2009 story about chickens running loose in the streets.</a>  An online organizing group <a href="http://iowacityurbanchickens.ning.com/">IC Friends of Urban Chickens</a> aims to "put the Iowa back in Iowa City."  In March, local police <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/88904712.html">confiscated chickens during a traffic stop</a> because state laws require permits to transport animals across borders.  (There were also squirrels in the car.)</p>

<p>USA Today points to the <a href="http://www.urbanchickens.net/2009/11/iowa-city-mayor-baileys-odd-anti.html">Iowa City mayor, Regenia Bailey</a> as the source for anti-backyard poultry sentiment; this is apparently a reaction to the risk that domestic fowl present to state agribusiness.
<blockquote>
"We have a lot of small farmers around here making chickens and eggs available for sale," Bailey says. "My fundamental question is: Why aren't we supporting the regional economy?"

      <p>Aardvark is <a href="http://vark.com/">vark.com</a> - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &#0160;It&#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &quot;your network&quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&#39;s capable of doing.</p><p>It might simply be that I&#39;ve been at it too long and my non-random sources for answers to random questions are just better. &#0160;If you&#39;ve collected enough mailing lists full of <a href="http://group.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">local people</a> or topical experts or <a href="http://listserv2.michigan.gov/wa.exe?A0=michlib-l">reference librarians</a>, the appeal of asking an unspecified audience is limited. &#0160;Ditto the comparison with asking the same question to Twitter where it might ping-pong into someone&#39;s news stream, or asking a network full of PR people on <a href="http://www.helpareporter.com/">HARO</a> in the hopes of luring in someone&#39;s publicist who is happy to answer.</p><p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>The challenge is to get rid of some set of books that have accumulated, while simultaneously fulfilling the need to always have some kind of new reading in the house. &#0160;</p><p>A new (to me) way to do this is <a href="http://www.paperbackswap.com">Paperback Swap</a>, a system which works as a trading board for books. &#0160;You are entitled to books in the proportion that you send books to others, and every book you request is free to you. &#0160;The catch is that you pay postage for the books you send to others.</p><p>Because of the sender-pays structure, many of the books listed are lightweight and cheap to mail. There&#39;s some calculus in people&#39;s minds that probably says &quot;I&#39;m willing to pay the cost of shipping to get rid of this.&quot;</p><p>I can imagine a lot of other things that could work the same way, looking especially for items that have relatively high value compared to weight, but where you might accumulate unwanted and unused items over time that have more swap value than use value. &#0160;It looks like <a href="http://www.swap-bot.com/">Swap-bot</a> fills some of that need for <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>-class homemade items.&#0160;</p><p><em>More on </em><a href="http://www.discardia.com/"><em>Discardia</em></a><em> from Dinah Sanders.</em></p>

      <p>James Poulos in a <a href="http://www.ricochet.com/conversations/Where-Are-All-the-Editors/(comment)/8368">comment on Ricochet</a> on the role of editors:</p>
<blockquote>Writers now have competing pressures -- to be witty, quick, ironic, noticeable, flip, to dispatch every clay pigeon tossed up by a culture pandemic with pigeons; but also to self-edit, to self-moderate, to be reticent at the right time, to pussyfoot expertly, to pick battles, to avoid perils, to besmirch rarely, to duck blame, to satisfy spectral overseers. This is a serious pickle, is it not? And yet it now appears to be the cost of doing business. Possibly, this is the internet imitating life.</blockquote>
<p>I loved the &quot;satisfy spectral overseers&quot; bit. Where did that come from? Who gets that description?</p>
<p>Knute Rockne, in a H.W. Wilson Company 1942 biography:</p> 
<blockquote>No one will ever tackle the job of football coach at the University of Notre Dame without a sense of solemn obligation, for the spirit of Knute Rockne still hovers above the campus like a spectral overseer. 
</blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney, as referenced in two 1990s management texts:</p>
<blockquote>Eisner came aboard and cleared the deck, bringing in new managers, most of whom had never met Disney. The new crew, freed of the spectral overseer, began to create a culture that was more sophisticated than stodgy, more adventurous than cautious, more ambitious than content.</blockquote>
<p>John Edward McCullough, from the <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org/location/ghost.htm">National Theatre</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The shade of Actor John Edward McCullough, a popular American thespian of the 1800&#39;s, is said to roam the premises of the theatre in the dark of night. No longer thirsting for an audience&#39;s applause, the once famed star performer has taken on the lonely role of ghostly custodian and spectral overseer, checking to be sure that all is in readiness for the next performance.</blockquote>
<p>I for one welcome the editorial guidance of our spectral overseers. But whose guidance should we channel for this task? &#0160;That&#39;s some other post about people (not necessarily &quot;writers&quot;) who have mastered the online form.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>An essay published in <a href="http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/in-defense-of-the-memory-theater/">Open Letters Monthly.</a></p>
<blockquote>What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">I fear for our memory theaters.</span></blockquote>
<p>Any essay of lamentation about the end of books and the glory of human memory has to include some touchstones.  Frances Yates is that touchstone here:</p>
<blockquote>One of the books that I used to habitually pick up from my college library, and which, recently, I finally bought used, is <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Frances Yates</span>’s classic <span style="background-color: #ffdfbf;">The Art of Memory</span>. First published in 1966, it chronicles lost mnemonic techniques, passed down from the ancient orators to the Renaissance humanists: spaces people would conjure in their minds to help them remember all the precious accoutrements of civilized knowledge.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-pi"><img alt="The Art of Memory" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="The Art of Memory" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>One of the pleasures of writing incessantly online is the likelihood that you&#39;ve run across something before, even if you don&#39;t have it in the top of memory.  Prentiss Riddle wrote about <a href="http://aprendizdetodo.com/time/?item=20030331">The Art of Memory</a> in 2003, apparently because I mentioned it on a mailing list, saying this:</p>
<blockquote>[Frances Yates], [The Art of Memory] -- just getting started on this one, which is an account of the history of mnemotechnics: the art and practice of expanding and augmenting the human memory. The classical account of this goes back to <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Simonides of Ceos</span>, who had memorized all of the names and seating arrangements of the attendees at a banquet while giving a speech to them and was thus able to identify the dead when the banquet hall collapsed. Ancient orators used these memory systems to memorize long, long speeches.</blockquote>
<p>Now, armed with a new word &quot;mnemotechnic&quot;, I can go through and pluck out this precious specimen from Google Books; the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ImcPAAAAYAAJ">Phreno-mnemotechnic dictionary</a>, a work from 1844 by <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Francis Fauvel-Gourand</span> with a preface that illustrates the noted figures in the history of those who have an exceptional memory. The bulk of the work is a dictionary compiled along the principles of &quot;soundex&quot;, where words with similar consonant structure are indexed together and given a number.  Thus you will find on page 62 the entry for 382 (&quot;homophony&quot;, &quot;muffin&quot;); to make this make sense, you need to get a mapping between the &quot;m&quot; sound and the number 3, &quot;f&quot; or &quot;ph&quot; and 8, &quot;n&quot; and 2, and then encode.</p>
<p>Could there be any practical use for this?  Certainly; this is a <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">learned synesthesia</span>, where numbers turn into words.  If you ever have had to memorize a license plate number (I am looking at one where the partial plate is &quot;6981&quot;) you know it&#39;s hard.  But knowing that 69 maps to &quot;sheep&quot; and 81 maps to &quot;fat&quot; means that this vehicle can be memorialized as &quot;sheepfat&quot;, which is wonderful in its own way.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ddebe2;">Now where was I?  Distracted, I guess</span>.  Like Nathan Schneider, my memories are indexed in part through the books I have been reading.  The bookshelf that he evokes, carefully collected, is the memory construct that says that when you pull in one book you want to be able to leaf through the one next to it on the bookshelf, or the whole shelf full of them assembled for a purpose.  You judge the quality of a story told through books by the quality and comprehensiveness of the books invoked to tell it, and you look for the bibliography eagerly for texts you have missed.</p>
<p>My bookshelves are too small to hold all the books that might sit on them, but sometimes there have been ways to make up for that.  The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/3177427/">photo of the bookshelf</a> provides some substitute to prove not only that you have had the books but also that you know that some go together with others.</p>

      <p><p>A comment I wrote on Ethan Hein&#39;s <a href="http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2009/in-the-sequencer-the-notation-is-the-performance">account of color-coding sequencer tracks:</a></p>
<blockquote>When you say “<span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">color coding improved your ears</span>”, the first thing that comes to mind is that you are doing some kind of machine-assisted <span style="background-color: #ffff80;">synesthesia</span>. very cool, that.</blockquote>
<p>another enticing pice from <a href="http://oblong.com/article/085zBpRSY9JeLv2z.html">oblong industries</a></p>
<blockquote>It&#39;s true that one of the elements is a blue ball that bounces in time to the music and touches down on the notes that are playing just then. Also true: a ball like that can never be entirely serious, but it can be entirely effective. What works is assisted <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">synaesthesia</span>, making sound seem like sight and looking seem like hearing. The time in which music happens is turned into the space of the animated score.</blockquote>
<p>And then pretty quickly we hit this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6YTQJVzwlI">video of John Underkoffler at TED</a> on the future of the user interface.  Not quite what I was after, very lovely in its own Minority Report style but not for the perspective I was after.</p>
<p>This has <a href="http://jaicoxkiod.blogspot.com/">an interesting perspective from a <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">synaesthete</span>, but I won&#39;t quote</a> based on the copyright:</p>

(2005), &quot;Artificial <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">Grapheme-Color Synesthesia</span> for Wearable Task Support&quot;, Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 108-113</p>
<blockquote>This paper presents the benefits of generating an artificial <span style="background-color: #ffbfdf;">visual synesthesia</span> through a wearable computer. Following a short introduction to remind the need for seamless human-wearable computer interactions, this paper makes the case for drawing upon synesthesia, a combination of the senses naturally occurring in a small portion of the population, to augment everyday entities and more precisely to enrich written graphemes. We present the rationale behind our research and summarize the functionality, architecture and implementation of our current prototype.

<p>and <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1124772.1124828">the followup paper</a> crucially gives the link to augmented reality</p>

      <p>Hiding in municipal archives across the county are maps of where the freeways will go. &nbsp;Some of them got built, some of them didn't. &nbsp;Those documents will date from after the Second World War, and lots of them will be 1950s and 1960s artifacts.</p>

<p>Some of the history will show up in land records; this <a href="http://www.genoa.org/community/history">account from Genoa Township</a> looks typical</p>
<blockquote>
The land was farmed from 1950 until 1962 when the Michigan State Highway came through and condemned eight different parcels in the township to construct Interstate 96. The State Highway Department gave the homesteaders 30 days to get out of their way. The Herbst family received $17,500 for their condemned 43.9 acres, which was then cut in half on a 45° angle.
</blockquote>

<p>Before the land was suddenly condemned, there must have been maps, drawing, photos, studies.</p>
