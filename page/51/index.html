<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</p>

<p>When you're on with a vision of how something could or should be, that great idea of yours is a liability, not an asset. It's going to take some huge amount of effort or activation of an existing set of skills or knowledge to go from bright idea to something that someone else can buy into. Resist the temptation to let other people have your perspective on the world spelled out to them too clearly before it gets a chance to adapt to circumstances, or at the very least if you are going to do this for someone for money sell them something that captures not just the time spent in that room but the whole world that you bring to making that room reflect reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Mobbability</strong>: the ability to do real-time work in very large groups; a tal­ent for coordinating with many people simultaneously.
<strong>Cooperation radar</strong>: the ability to sense, almost intuitively, who would make the best collaborators on a particular task.
<strong>Ping quotient</strong>: measures your responsiveness to other people’s requests for engagement.

      <p>is still worth fighting over, if you and your brother both want it.</p>

<p>What's the smallest piece of lego?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35795&pid=625188&mode=threaded&start=">eurobricks forum</a> suggests it is a flower petal.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.lugnet.com/market/shipping/?n=362">Lugnut</a> says a gold coin, weighing in at just over 0.056 g; the flower petal is a hefty 0.064 g.</p>

<p>For reference, a 1x1 plate is 0.176 g and a 1x8 brick is 3.06 g.</p>

<p>You'll need a lot of legos to build a <a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/lego/mosaics.html">lego mosaic</a>.  I don't even want to thing about the cost of lego bricks per kilogram, or maybe I will; this <a href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/3480-1">package of 25 1x8 bricks has an MSRP of $6</a>, or about $80/kg, or $36/lb.  This discussion on <a href="http://www.classic-space.com/plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?79878">classic-space</a> suggests mixed lego goes for $9-12/lb in 2009 dollars.</p>

      <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.</p><p>In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. &#0160;This blog has a &quot;garlic mustard&quot; tag, which signals that I should write about that at least once a year; without that reminder, somehow I might miss that opportunity to refresh that annual recipe opportunity. &#0160; The category list is long, but finite, and it&#39;s idiosyncratic to reflect some peculiar sense of evolved focus.</p><p>Tags are much harder, especially in a world of tags shared across a team. &#0160;There are enough variant spellings and punctuation in an 8000 unit tag cloud to make it tough to see which of those tags are most useful. &#0160;Perhaps I can carve out 20 or 30 to make my own, items to revisit repeatedly, but the system as a system does not constrain me as such.</p><p>It&#39;s very useful to have a bucket that can be usefully refilled periodically. &#0160;At the cycle of once per year, the cumulative knowledge of paczki rituals or cudighi recipes makes each successive year easier. &#0160;Monthly rituals leave room to breathe between attempts, and weekly cycles build up a substantial body of work in just a year. &#0160;</p><p>In many ways this is the mindless mindfulness approach to sustained productivity; don&#39;t decide what of 1000s of things you might do, simply have one picked for you and then go at it with a strict deadline to get you to where you need to go until the next time. &#0160;The effort can be impromptu and doesn&#39;t require much explicit preparation, since you&#39;ve primed the pump with previous work. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.</p>
<p>Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted.</p>
<p>Progress is a hard thing to measure with any degree of certainty. &#0160;&quot;Increase the n&quot; is one typical useful task, as though by heaping on one more of whatever it is that you are counting you can get one measure closer to ultimate success. &#0160;&quot;Decrease the n&quot; is the other task, which generally for me is the Sisyphian task of emptying the inbox or washing the dishes. &#0160;You&#39;re never really done, and the only progress you note is that something happened today.</p>
<p>The meaningless indicator of progress can simply be the recognition that you have hit some temporary and attainable local high point to the day, and that even if tomorrow brings you back to a spot where you need to do more, you at least did what you needed to do today. &#0160;Shining the sink is the domestic equivalent of inbox zero; yes, there still may be more to do tomorrow, but at least for today you&#39;re at the bottom of what needs to be done.</p>

      <p>I put in an application for <a href="http://www.igniteannarbor.com/">Ignite 3 Ann Arbor</a>.  5 minutes, 20 slides.  The working structure for the talk is the 5 minute or so talk I give at the beginning of every a2b3 meeting, with the little ritual introduction of the group and the origin story and the monologue.  I think it will work out; heaven knows that I've had some practice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.</p>

<p>I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz. So off it goes, at least for now. Let Twitter be Twitter.</p>

<p>I suspect that blog-related stuff should land here, since there's at least some pretense that it should be longer. I almost wish there was a one-pass "post this to my blog too"; indeed, the first draft of this was written in Buzz, until I figured that it really should be posted to Vacuum and then pulled into Buzz through the feed. I guess. I hope that works.</p>

<p>It's always nice to try out some new communications system, especially one that makes you rethink your use of all of the old systems you had gotten out of the habit of using. I've also liked which random people from my address book that Google decided should be my first set of friends; they did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>The "quick compose" part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don't have titles, so I don't get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type.  Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like.</p>

<p>Excerpt from Freakonomics review</p>
<blockquote>
Even more interesting are the stories about Walmart’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the real reason why David Lee Roth used to demand that there be a bowl of M&amp;M’s with all the brown ones removed in his dressing room backstage.</blockquote>

<p>Times Online <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article6995508.ece">review</a></p>

<blockquote>The surgeon-author was on the track of what might be described as a classic magic bullet — a low-tech way in a high-tech, expensive world in which lives might be saved and costs reduced. Gawande, using his own word, was searching for “eptitude” — the business of making sure that those with knowledge applied it effectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following checklist is designed to aid the checklist creation process and ensure that your checklist helps instead of hurts. &#0160;It was created by Dr. Atul Gawande, the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health Dissemination Team, and Dan Boorman of Boeing.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The nicest wiki implementation of checklists I&#39;ve seen is at Sunshine Review, using the MediaWiki dpl extension.</p>

<p>Another review, in <a href="https://www.indiacurrents.com/articles/2010/06/04/from-ignorance-to-ineptitude-to-eptitude">India Currents</a> 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But does novelty really matter when lives are at stake? In a
recent New York Times article about implementing checklists, Dr.
Peter Pronovost (whose contribution Gawande  acknowledges) exclaimed
that “You would have thought I started World War III.” He then
asserted that having nurses check to ensure that doctors washed
their hands has “gotten infection rates down to almost zero in the
ICU.” With success like that, patients are probably saying, “Thank
you very much, Dr. Gawande. Your manifesto may not be War and Peace,
but it has saved more lives than Tolstoy’s novel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pronovost is interviewed in a Wall Street Journal article,
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576131963185893084">The Secret to Fighting Infections</a>,
from 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pronovost&rsquo;s boyish appearance and enthusiastic manner belie a steely determination to challenge the status quo in medicine. He hasn&rsquo;t shied away from criticizing his peers for resisting safety and quality improvement efforts, a theme of his 2009 book &ldquo;Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals.&rdquo;</p>

Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called <span class="il">networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span> hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.</p></blockquote><p>Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&#39;s my interpretation.&#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.</p><p>The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are <strong>flexible and reconfigurable</strong> (&quot;versatile&quot;).&#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.</p><p>The second note is the that the agents are <strong>diverse</strong> (oddly, in this language, &quot;degenerate&quot;) in their skills.&#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&#0160; </p><p>Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&#0160;&#0160; For any individual task, there&#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&#0160; </p><p>I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&#0160; I haven&#39;t even made sense yet of the &quot;network buffering&quot; piece.&#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.</p><p></p>

      <p><strong>Cauliflower Curry</strong><br /><br />1 Tbs canola oil<br />1 large onion, chopped<br />2 8 oz packages savory baked tofu<br />curry powder<br />1 head cauliflower, cut into florets, steamed<br />coconut milk, about half a can<br />diced tomatoes, one small can<br /><br />Heat the canola oil over medium heat (<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>).&#0160; Add chopped onion.<br />Cook until fragrant.&#0160; Add curry powder - I generally sprinkle it<br />lightly over the top - and stir until even more fragrant and colorful.<br />Add diced tofu, stir so that the curry powder is equally mixed in.<br /><br />Don&#39;t cook so hot that the onions brown, but get everything hot<br />enough that if you stopped you could eat the mixture right there.<br /><br />Add steamed cauliflower, stir until everything is coated with the curried<br />onion.&#0160; Adjust the seasonings so that the color is right.<br /><br />Add the coconut milk and diced tomatoes.&#0160; If you are using canned<br />tomatoes, consider reserving some of the liquid so that the curry<br />is not too soupy.&#0160; Stir, bring to heat at <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>, then reduce the heat<br />to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> and cook until the color is right.&#0160; (At the start, you will<br />have a pinkish tone because the tomatoes are raw; you are aiming for<br />a more curry color, which will happen when the tomatoes are cooked<br />through).<br /><br />With the right amount of liquid, this can be served over rice or with<br />rice on the side to sop it up.<br /><br />Serves as many people as you make it for; I allow 4 oz of tofu per<br />family member.<br /><br /><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />It could probably have peas added to it.<br /><br />Freeze the other half a can of coconut milk for the next time you<br />do this recipe.<br /><p>Even better the next day if there&#39;s any left.</p><p>We like the <em>Panda</em> brand savory baked tofu from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan%20Soy%20Products">Michigan Soy Products</a> in Royal Oak, MI, available in Ann Arbor at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/PFC">People&#39;s Food Coop</a>.</p></p>
