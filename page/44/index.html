<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Thanks to a a promo code I had a chance to look at <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/hello-america/" target="_self">Spotify</a>. Some first impressions.</p>
<p>The service looks like an iTunes which you can play any song that you can find, for free. I haven&#39;t probed the catalog to see how deep it is, but the Beatles and Bob Dylan are represented by cover bands, not the originals. It&#39;s shiny, and the music plays instantly when you click on a song.</p>
<p>1. It doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Napster; perhaps nothing ever will, again. Part of the joy of Napster was the thrill of the chase, knowing that every time you searched it it would be a little different, and that every possible obscure track might be online some day so if it wasn&#39;t there you just wanted to come back the next day.</p>
<p>2. I can&#39;t reconstruct the playlist for all of the tracks on the mix CD in my car, so for some definition of &quot;completeness&quot;, it isn&#39;t complete. That may say more about my tastes in music than anything else. I suppose that anyone who favors Da Yoopers and Barcelona is going to have problems with any service conceived in this decade.</p>
<p>3. Coca-Cola ads everywhere, plus splashy art for artists I don&#39;t know anything about. I suppose that&#39;s a plausible monetization strategy, but it&#39;s distracting.</p>
<p>4. After playing 5 or 6 tracks it put up an advertisement for an 80s playlist, which means that either it&#39;s profiling my interests from the songs I play, or it&#39;s otherwise assuming that how old I am specifies my musical tastes relatively completely.</p>
<p>Looks like a great service, but I&#39;m clearly not the target demographic.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>MARQUETTE – Faye M. Amo, age 57, of 425 West Ridge Street, Marquette,
entered eternal life Wednesday evening, July 13, 2011, at her home
in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula
Home Health and Hospice.</p>

<p>Born March 23, 1954 in Lima, Ohio, a daughter of Stephen J. and
Ethel (Salidas) Catel, Faye was raised in Ishpeming and graduated
from the Ishpeming High School as salutatorian of her class. From
her days in grade school, Faye held the desire to become a teacher.
She enrolled at Northern Michigan University, where she received
her baccalaureate degree summa cum laude (with highest honor) with
a double major in French and English. She continued at Northern,
obtaining a double masters degree in English and French in 1977 and
later studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris where she
earned highest honors in French.</p>

<p>Faye’s
lifelong dream of becoming a teacher began with her first teaching
assignment at the Ishpeming High School in 1977. In 1979, she started
teaching French at the Marquette Senior High School, a career that
would span 31 years. Teaching French was her passion in life and
she loved all her students and they loved her. Affectionately known
as Madame Amo, she was the consummate professional teacher, one who
truly cared about her students and was dedicated to their education
and well-being.</p>

<p>It was not enough that the
students learned the French language, she felt they needed to
experience what “French” meant. Heading the French Club at Marquette
Senior High School, Faye planned numerous trips for club members
to big city museums to view French art exhibits, eat at French
eateries, and learn about French culture. Over the years, several
trips were taken to Chicago and to France in her mission to educate.
These memorable events were always anticipated by Faye and greeted
with enthusiasm by her students. For a number of years, she served
as class advisor, particularly enjoying building and decorating
floats for homecoming and decorating the gym for junior prom
activities. Throughout her life, Faye maintained an untiring interest
in the students at MSHS, often asking parents about their children,
even through the children may never have been her students and she
kept in regular contact with students who were now living adult
lives, with families of their own.</p>

<p>In addition
to her affiliations at MSHS as foreign language department head for
several years, class advisor for the MSHS graduating class of 2008,
and serving on numerous parent-teacher committees, Faye was also a
member of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption and the Ladies
Philoptochos Society, and active in civic committees such as the
American Association of University Women and the Marquette
Beautification Committee. In her leisure, Faye loved walking her
dog, Mario, for the 13 years of his life, bicycling, running – even
participating in marathons in Detroit and France, and riding in her
boat on beautiful Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Faye is
survived by her husband, John; her cherished son, Bret; two sisters,
Stephanie (Bob) Trumm and Jayme (Rick) Iknoiah both of California;
her mother-in-law, Leone Amo of Ironwood; brothers-in-law, Tom Amo
of Philadelphia, PA, Jim (Brooke) Amo of Livonia, and Ken Amo of
Ft Worth, TX; and several nieces and nephews. Faye was preceded in
death by her father, the honorable judge, Stephen J. Catel, her
mother, Ethel Catel; brother-in-law, Andrew Walton; and father-in-law,
John M. Amo.</p>

<p>The family will receive friends
at the Swanson-Lundquist Funeral Home on Sunday from 4:00 pm until
7:00 pm. Trisagion will be held at 6:00 pm. The Funeral Liturgy
will be held on Monday, July 18, at 11:00 am at the Greek Orthodox
Church of the Assumption with Rev. Tom Michalos officiating. Burial
will be made in the Park Cemetery. Pallbearers will be Jimmy Pedakis,
Lou Roumanis, Paul Andronis, Paul Wainio, Gary Shaffer, and Craig
Cox. Memorials may be directed to the Greek Orthodox Church of the
Assumption, 235 W. Ridge Street, Marquette, MI 49855 or to the Faye
Amo Scholarship Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 101 W. Washington Street,
Marquette, MI 49855. Condolences may be expressed online at

paix.</p>

      <p>Google+ is to Twitter as Usenet is to IRC. Discuss.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m writing this down just so I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore; I don&#39;t know what Facebook is in this context.)</p>
<p>To elaborate: Google+ is like Usenet, except with no newsgroups, and most of the control over what you read being done through kill files and keep files. It&#39;s so busy that you can never catch up, and the default group is a combination of rec.pets.cats, talk.bizarre, and news.announce.newusers.</p>
<p>Twitter is like IRC, except that you&#39;re all on one channel. The hashtag syntax creates things similar to channels, which makes the whole mess easier to keep up with as long as your interests can be narrowed.&#0160;</p>
<p>In both cases, the inversion from the original system is that the fundamental unit of following is no longer the topic, it&#39;s the person. If your favorite Dr. Who fan also publishes lots of photos of their cats, you have to read them both together. There&#39;s no way on Google+ to carve out a narrow channel for deep discussion, not yet at least - you would expect that is the natural evolution, just as Twitter added support for emergent hash tags after they had been invented.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The ability (and the need) to edit other people&#39;s words is a sign of power over them, especially when it can be done without leaving a trace.&#0160;</p>
<p>The WELL, one of the ur-communities online, has this bold fundamental statement of literary authority:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.well.com/yoyow.html" target="_self">You own your own words.</a> This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on the WELL and that reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside of the WELL&#39;s conferencing system may be challenged by you, the author.</strong></blockquote>
<div>Every other online system I&#39;ve ever seen has something much weaker than this. The typical contribution to most networked writing places grants an unlimited license to reuse the work, with this one no worse than most:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.politonomist.com/important-notices/" target="_self">By posting a comment on Politonomist.com</a>, you grant Politonomist and it’s subsidiaries an indefinite and unlimited license to reproduce, edit and make use of the comment in any non-slanderous method seen fit.</blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<p>At least they said &quot;non-slanderous&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons that I continue to write on my own weblog as opposed to transferring my digital identity to some other system is that I have edit rights on all of the content and all of the discontent here. If someone publishes a comment, I have the ability to modify, delete, and quote from it. I&#39;m not certain that I&#39;ve asserted any specific moral rights to do this, but practically the &quot;edit&quot; button is all you need.</p>
<p>Oh, to be writing in a place where word ownership was unambiguous.</p>

      <p>A fascinating account of how Zappo&#39;s improved the quality of reviews on its site by hiring Mechanical Turkers to correct spelling and grammar. From <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/04/want-to-improve-sales-fix-grammar-and.html" target="_self">Behind the Enemy Lines</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An online retailer noticed that, indeed, products with high-quality reviews are selling well. So, they decided to take action. The retailer used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of the reviews posted on its own website. Using the&#0160;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/soylent.pdf">Find-Fix-Verify pattern</a>, the retailed used Mechanical Turk to examine&#0160;<strong><em>millions&#0160;</em></strong>of product reviews. (Here are the archived versions of the HITs:&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/79f44798e8c296e29bddbd3a3aa8f60a/">Find</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/160L5FUZB7DDN03NIAB2D4J8HRZ022/">Fix</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/1QPDXYWLI7K28IZ6MAP7WEO0N6V03B/">Verify</a>. And if you have not figured out the firm name by now, the retailer is Zappos.) For the reviews with mistakes,<strong><em>they fixed the spelling and grammar errors! Thus they effectively improved the quality of the reviews on their website. And, correspondingly, they improved the demand for their products.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The estimated copy editing cost is $0.10 per review. Imagine how many other paragraph-sized chunks of text could be improved for a dime a piece, this post included.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I can't help myself to think of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle when considering the new Google+ system and how it organizes people into circles. The circle, properly constructed, is a "karass", the people who you are following around and around. The pivot of the karass is a "wampeter", the thing which draws you together - "a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail".</p>
<p>I go back to Seb Paquet's <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/2002/10/09.html#a426" target="_self">essay on ridiculously easy group formation</a>&nbsp;as a sense for how the Internet used to be if you wanted to start a collective enterprise. Most of the tasks at that time were relatively heavyweight, in that you had to begin something and set up the software infrastructure before you started to use it. Now, with most social networks, group formation is as easy as settling on a name for what you are doing, making that name prominent within your communications (e.g. using it as a hash tag), and then just doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at Google+ for pivots, you find people, but not ideas. Energy clusters around individual activity, and though it's possible to nominally describe a circle of people as being interested in football or ice hockey, you can't guarantee that those people will reciprocate by only writing about football or ice hockey. One thing you do all have in common, though is Google+ - and thus the wampeter that draws you all in is the system itself.</p>
<p>Following Vonnegut again there are two wampeters for each karass, one waxing, one waning. Fortunately we do have the other one named here already; an animal. Specifically a cat.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-10-nine-circles-of-googleplus/">Nine circles of</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of the fun of <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_self">Google+</a>&#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &quot;circles&quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&#39;s private groups). It&#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard.</p>
<p>If Google knew who I went to high school with, it would be inviting me to make a &quot;high school friends&quot; circle, and it would be planning a reunion. But it&#39;s Facebook where that activity is going on, and Facebook where that particular circle of friends and former friends lives. It lives there not because I carefully and laboriously put it there but because Facebook has a group structure (however imperfect) that allows for shared group building, shared tagging of photos, shared lots of things.<br /><br />On Google+ I have no visibility into what other people&#39;s groupings for me are. If you think about just that, it&#39;s remarkable - no one would add me to a mailing list and start sending me things without me knowing it, and no one adds me to a named Facebook community or even a Twitter list without that being at least nominally visible. Yet only Google knows what other people categorize me as, and as more random names show up in my &quot;you were just added to a circle by...&quot; list, the more that particular information asymmetry seems to be visible.</p>
<p>It has been wearying to try to make sense of circles. If you engage in the system, you are expected to classify and categorize all of your correspondents into some kind of bucket that describes them. Alas, real people are many faceted, and don&#39;t fit into any single oversimplified category or stay narrowly focused on one topic. More to the point, I can&#39;t stay on topic myself unless I have a separate place narrowly defined where I&#39;m exploring a topic rather than just vacuuming up something interesting.</p>
<p>Google+ circles have cut into my sleep, and that&#39;s why you see circles under my eyes. I&#39;m better off resting up and spending the time creating things rather than figuring out which tiny bucket to sort them into.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.</p>
<p>In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in. They may have more context of the local situation, more access to people in positions of leadership, or more ability to get someone on the street to see something interesting, but they are not there first on the scene with exclusive coverage.</p>
<p>Last night, over ten thousand people listened in live and in real time as a hostage situation in Grand Rapids, Michigan came to a violent end over the police scanner. Everyone listening heard it first hand, before the news media had a chance to interpret it for them.</p>
<p>The best account of listening to the scanner is Mark W. Smith&#39;s Detroit Free Press piece, &quot;<a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110708/NEWS06/110708030/Mark-W-Smith-Online-police-scanner-an-eerie-window-into-gunman-s-standoff" target="_self">Online police scanner an eerie window into gunman&#39;s standoff</a>&quot;, which paints a vivid picture of what it was like to be in a newsroom listening to scanner traffic from hundreds of miles away. In contrast, Nathan Bomey&#39;s piece &quot;<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/grand-rapids-murders-terrorize-but-jennifer-granholm-tweeting-about-her-new-chevy-volt/" target="_self">Grand Rapids murders terrorize, but Jennifer Granholm tweeting about her new Chevy Volt</a>&quot; is noteworthy primarily for not sounding like it was written with the scanner going in the background - because if you were paying attention to what was happening in Grand Rapids while it was happening, you&#39;d never even have noticed that some people weren&#39;t yet tuned in yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-recyclebank/">Recyclebank Ann Arbor reports released; coupon redemption rates are low, but people recycle anyway</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the City of Ann Arbor has released reports showing the participation rate of Ann Arbor households in the <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/" target="_self">Recyclebank</a> program, which rewards citizens for putting out their recycling. The reports were provided in graphical format, so all numbers here are approximated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20May%202011%20Report.pdf" target="_self">summary report of program performance</a> provided in response to the request shows that about 40% of eligible citizens (about 9500 of 24000) have signed up for the program. These citizens accumulate points which can be exchanged for coupons that offer discounts to participating merchants. In the most recent month reported, May 2011, citizens earned about 1.5 million points and cashed in about 10% of them, resulting in about 1600 rewards ordered.</p>
<p>The Recyclebank contract costs the City of Ann Arbor about $200,000 per year. At current reward redemption rates, citizens will cash in on the order of 20,000 reward coupons, or less than one per eligible household, at an estimated program cost of approximately $10 per delivered coupon. This number could be $15 per coupon at the low monthly participation rate, and $7 per coupon at the high monthly rate; participation varies with the seasons, and a complete year of data is not yet in.</p>
<p>The reports provided do not address the question of whether rewards are increasing participation in the recycling program. If it did, this <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20Route%20by%20Route%20Report%20May%202011.pdf" target="_self">detail report showing recycling rates per route</a> would also include a Recyclebank participation rate per route, and you&#39;d be able to see at a glance whether routes with a high degree of Recyclebank participation correlate with increased recycling performance.</p>
<p>Are incentives driving increased recycling use? The reports provided do not make a compelling case. Redemption rates are so low that most people don&#39;t appear to bother cashing in their rewards. Even with this low redemption rate, almost 90% of people put their recycle cart out at least once a month, suggesting that people in Ann Arbor are already recycling at a high rate independent of external rewards.</p>

      <p>In summary, the train will be late, and it will be later than you had previously expected it to be late because of delays on the line due to the track owner (Norfolk Southern) restricting the speed of the track user (Amtrak). &#0160;See <a href="http://amtrakdelays.onlineschedulingsoftware.com/" target="_self">Amtrak Train Status History</a> for details.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was away from my computer for a few days, but still near my Blackberry - a not-so-smart smartphone with a rudimentary web browser that is reminiscent of the finer parts of web browsing circa 1995. It&#39;s even better than 1995 in that the browser is so portable that it can go with you everywhere, and thus can be reasonably expected to be a mobile companion on social network outings.</p>
<p>Twitter is completely usable on this device, and the brief updates that people provide are ideal. The mobile Twitter web interface doesn&#39;t do a lot to support lists, but searches work great, and it&#39;s easily possible to follow along with what is going on and participate. It&#39;s an excellent companion in the car, especially when you&#39;re not driving. (Don&#39;t text and drive.)</p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s mobile web interface is rudimentary, but it does have access to almost all of the parts of the system that might make a difference. My phone is not smart enough to let me upload a photo directly into Facebook, but it did allow me to drop in a pleasantry or two, enough to satisfy the minimum social obligation.</p>
<p>Gmail on this device is slow, but fully functional. I wasn&#39;t able to keep up with my inbox, but it wasn&#39;t like I was really trying to, and it was incredibly handy to be able to search my email archives when I needed to.</p>
<p>Google+ is new, and it used to have support for my miserable browser when it launched; but that disappeared soon after launch. I was unattached to G+ throughout its holiday launch weekend.</p>
<p>I am sure that if I had a more capable device, my preferences would be more towards the fancier, newer systems with richer user interfaces and more shiny attractive access. That said, I don&#39;t know if more access is actually better when I&#39;m on the move. All three systems accumulate a social debt that has to be repaid in some way, in that mentions should be reciprocated, messages should be returned, and plans should be acknowledged. Unless you&#39;re willing to be transmit-only when you&#39;re on the move, none of the systems had enough bandwidth on my slightly-smart phone to really keep up with accumulated social network debris.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I have just now gotten access to Google+, so this review is a reflection of other reviews, some personal experience, and a weary view of novelty.</p>
<p>Google+ is out in very limited test. Some small number of well connected people now have access to a new piece of social software from Google, and initial reviews have been generally positive.</p>
<p>How do you assess whether the initial reviews of a system designed for communications are accurate for when the system eventually gets rolled out to a wider audience? Consider that the first people into the system were hand picked, that they generally like getting access to new systems, and that they are relatively experienced and gregarious online experts. Certainly they will like something new that only they have access to - quite independent of the set of features - because it gives them a chance to reconnect to old online friends and make some new ones.</p>
<p>When a communications system becomes available to the general public, the system dynamics change greatly. The initial group of participants can all be presumed to be interesting to each other, so talking to any random individual is likely to be someone relatively near you in social circumstance. As the population explodes, the random person gets less and less interesting, to the limit of when the random person is likely to be a spammer.</p>
<p>Google+ is at the invention stage. Much like Facebook seeded its early use poll with Ivy League students, Google+ is doing its shakedown cruise with fans and friends and family in the first batch. Who wouldn&#39;t like to try out a new, expensive, mostly empty system and establish yourself in it? I&#39;m waiting for the next round of invites, and hoping to enjoy it while it&#39;s in early growth stages and not when it&#39;s in long-in-the-tooth maintenance mode.</p>

      <p>I walked a lot more today than I normally would have walked, thanks to my new game <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game.html" target="_self">Walking Around</a>. Here&#39;s some of the bonus points I scored that I wouldn&#39;t have scored in my previous quest, Sitting Around Typing.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Path (+1). It&#39;s always good to find a way to get from here to there that&#39;s not on any map. The pedestrian path I found connects Needham Road to Amelia Place. I&#39;ve added that little segment to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_self">Open Street Map</a> so that I can find it again, and so that I can cut through one more neighborhood with confidence. My son and I took this route to his summer camp today, and he suggested one more point for Unfamiliar Route (+1).</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 3" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Unexpected Lunch Companions (+2). If you wait for the bus at a bus stop near a restaurant, and if someone you know happens to be driving to that restaurant, then not only can you have an unexpectedly pleasant lunch but you can also get a ride downtown. Thanks to the Toziers for the happy coincidence and for a beginning of a discussion of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Annexation" target="_self">annexation and township islands</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 4" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 4" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Urban Foraging (+1). Juneberries are in season, which means that a carefully selected path will take you past some delicious snacks, right out there in the open, where thousands of people walk each day but none notice except the birds and a few brave souls who appreciate <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org/city/Juneberries" target="_self">Amalanchier</a>. For more berrypicking ideas, I follow Linda Diane Feldt&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/wildcrafting" target="_self">@wildcrafting</a> Twitter account. For lots more detail on Amalanchier, the 1946 <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24609952M/American_species_of_Amelanchier" target="_self">American Species of Amalachier</a> has ranges and keys for native species.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 5" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 5" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Park Benches (+2). If, at the end of your trek, you stop to wait for the bus - then it&#39;s useful to note that sometimes the bus stop is close to a park which has a park bench in the shade. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Douglas_Park" target="_self">Douglas Park</a>&#0160;is a nice place to wait for the #4, especially if you have <a href="http://mobile.theride.org/" target="_self">RideTrak</a> running on your cell phone to tell you when to get up and walk to the stop 1/2 block south of the park. My walk the next morning circled around all the way back to this park bench.</p>
<p>North Star (+1). A nice night walk on a clear night gives you all of the directions you need when Polaris is visible in the north sky. The drawing is from H. A. Rey&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547132808/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=superpatron-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0547132808">The Stars</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0547132808&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" width="1" />, my all time favorite book about the night sky.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 6" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 6" /></a> <br /><br /></p>

<p>How do I come up with this bonus point structure? If you walk around enough, something that you see or do is bound to make you happy. Give yourself points for those happy places, and know where they are so that you can revisit them.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-28-walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game/">Walking Around, a new urban walking game</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s played.</p>
<p>First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including <a href="http://walkertracker.com/" target="_self">Walker Tracker</a>, <a href="http://swellnessresearch.wordpress.com/projects/steps/" target="_self">Steps</a>, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily.</p>
<p>Second - and here is what is novel, at least to me - is that there&#39;s a bonus structure in the game designed to award bonuses for when you have accomplished tasks. The first bonus award that I&#39;m awarding myself looks at constructing a walk so that you make an orbit around the biggest possible chunk of territory; that is to say, repeated walks along the same path will get you zero bonus, but going out of your way on a detour will add to your score, and trekking through unfamiliar territory in a big loop is the best.</p>
<p>So far this is a pen and paper game and I haven&#39;t fully worked out the point structure. I have a notion that you capture territory every time you orbit it, so that you might win a park by going all the way around it, and you might win a political ward or precinct by capturing a loop around it. To simplify greatly, since I am trying to keep record of this in a small book, I&#39;m just drawing a graph with destinations rather than tracking every street.</p>
<p>Some idea sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aadl.org/node/18868" target="_self">Riverwalks Ann Arbor</a>&#0160;is a book of walking loops along the Huron River, written by&#0160;Brenda E. Bentley.</p>

I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to beat that top score.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://play.aadl.org/" target="_self">AADL Summer Reading Game</a>&#0160;has points for reading books and badges for doing various other tasks, and the gamers there know how to make a game that will make you read.

<p><strong>Failure of the fourth estate.&#0160;</strong>Newspapers and websites all over the country have reported on the flooding and fire at Fort Calhoun, but most articles simply paraphrase and regurgitate information from the NRC and OPPD press releases, which aggregators and bloggers then, in turn, simply cut and paste. Even the&#0160;<em>Omaha World-Herald</em>&#0160;didn&#39;t send local reporters to cover the story; instead, the newspaper published an article on the recent fire written by Associated Press reporters &ndash; based in Atlanta and Washington.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.</p>
<p>Some background for context.</p>
<p>The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3149678" target="_self">Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families</a> (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Top of page&quot; shows up in the news and design business as &quot;above the fold&quot;; see this Boxes and Arrows design article, <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/blasting-the-myth-of" target="_self">Blasting the Myth of the Fold</a>&#0160;(2007).</p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s Top News page comes from their Edgerank algorithm, the details of which change as quickly as and are kept as proprietary as Google&#39;s Pagerank algorithm.&#0160;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/" target="_self">EdgeRank: The Secret Sauce That Makes Facebook’s News Feed Tick</a> (Techcrunch, 2010) gives a simplified explanation of it.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.annarborsummerfestival.org/index.php/events/top_of_the_park/" target="_self">Top of the park</a>&quot; is the music and movies part of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, held on Ingalls Mall. It used to be hosted at the top of the parking structure next to the Power Center, hence the name.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-24-unpolished-open-notebook/">Unpolished writing in the open notebook</a>
      </h3>
      <p><em>Steve Crocker, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3" target="_self">Internet Request for Comments 3</a>, from 1969: &quot;There is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.&quot;</em></p>
<p>From time to time, someone reads Vacuum and comments that the writing looks unpolished and incomplete. Why would you publish this kind of work, which obviously isn&#39;t up to the standards that would let you sell it to someone for use in print? Why wouldn&#39;t you hide it in your notebooks?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this weblog as a notebook, and publishing my notes for myself instead of always as a tightly edited, polished, finished work. By exposing this part of a process I hope to be prepared to find some way to make myself understood, even if I don&#39;t completely understand myself immediately as I write through an issue or question. Thoughts go in, get refined as far as they need to be to make them coherent, and then go onto the net and into the world so that there&#39;s room for the next piece to emerge.</p>
<p>The open notebook is going to be messy, but it also means that I have some hope of finding my own half-finished work and revisiting it years later; when I don&#39;t do that, there&#39;s always something lost. Writing this way lets me tune into ideas, spin them around for a bit until I have a clearer focus, and move on. In most cases, I&#39;m not ready to make things shiny and neat, and I&#39;m content to explore facets of an unpolished gem over a series of years.</p>
<p><em>Previously, because I put it out there in first draft format so that I could find it again: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/first-version-coherent.html" target="_self">make the first version coherent</a> (from 2011); &#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/creativity-vs-p.html" target="_self">creativity vs productivity</a>&#0160;(from 2008); on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/04/shitty_first_dr.html" target="_self">shitty first drafts</a> (from 2007); <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/05/my_quadrille_no.html" target="_self">wishing that my weblog looked more like my quadrille notebooks</a> (from 2004).</em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-summer-2011-discardia-notes/">Summer 2011 discardia notes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at <a href="http://www.discardia.com" target="_self">discardia.com</a>. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.</p>
<p>For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. Before you can do a rebuild of a model that you already have, you need to find all of the impossibly tiny scattered pieces that make it up. A multipart storage box container is a great way to occupy a small boy&#39;s hour cleaning and sorting, because only when you have all of the yellow pieces together do you find the tiny Lego-sized firefighters accessories. Once you get down to the level that you can find the tiny black fireman&#39;s axe, the small child is content to build with it rather than agitate to buy more.</p>
<p>Books are my bane of accumulation existence, to the point where deciding what to do with them takes more energy than actually reading them. We have used Paperback Swap to maintain a steady state of inventory and still get new reading materials, and Books By Chance to dispose of surplus. Fortunately, the Lego situation (q.v.) is under control enough that I have reclaimed one bookshelf, which is being carefully curated as best I can to contain the collection that I would keep if it were my only shelf of books. Every decision to add to it means there&#39;s a corresponding decision to remove a book, and that keeps the shelf from accumulating dust and ennui.</p>
<p>The element of my life that absorbs more time than it should is the Internet, especially the Internet of flitting around from site to site trying to decide that someone has written something new worth writing. My self control is weak for shiny new things, but what I have discovered is that I can replace self control with ritual sometimes, and a ritual of writing on a specific topic for a specific person rather than reading aimlessly repays the time. I don&#39;t know yet how to cure a ritual addiction to being online, though Paul Jones&#39;s &quot;no email&quot; project points to one way to discard a portion of the online existence while staying connected.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Dinah Sanders for the &quot;decide and do&quot; theme for this season&#39;s <a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a>. John Weise and Stephanie Bentley run <a href="http://www.booksbychance.com/">Books By Chance</a>, a consignment used bookstore which helps deal with my book surplus. Duane Collicott&#39;s Bricks for Brains provides an annual Lego surplus at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/brick-bash-lego-2011.html">Brick Bash</a>.
