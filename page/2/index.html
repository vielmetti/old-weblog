      </h3>
      <p>Some notes before I try to do the build.</p>

<p>The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.</p>

<p>Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.</p>

<p>The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). Some sort of adapter jack (or alligator clips) should be all I need.</p>

<p>I can test the antenna on my Nokia 635 which has an FM tuner connected with the headphone jack as the antenna, and the ideal situation will be to have an antenna that I can just plug either into my phone or into my SDR tuner interchangeably. Once I figure all that out, the next next step is to make these antenna inputs for other radios. One step at a time though.</p>

<p>I'll be working from the tutorial <a href="http://willus.com/author/antenna.shtml">Making a Dipole FM Antenna</a> on willus.com .</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My goal for the week was to empty out my inbox sufficiently that I would be able to make progress on some programming tasks that are hard to do when there's distractions. The inbox got all the way down to zero, and that meant that there was a chunk of evening time suitable for hacking. Happy to report that the result of this is Node-RED running on a Raspberry Pi under Docker on top of Hypriot. A word of explanation of how this all works in detail is too much, but here's where I got the parts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-on-your-arm-device/">Hypriot's gettting started guide</a> brings you up to speed on getting Docker running on your ARM device (e.g. your Raspberry Pi). They have bootable images that you can download and burn to SD card, and from there you load up applications from Docker.</p>

<p>Hypriot has a <a href="https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk">chat window</a> on Gitter, so you can pop in and there will be occasionally people to assist. Best to do things European time.</p>

<p>Docker's <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> is a one stop shop for packaged applications. When you're running on the Pi, you'll want to seek out versions with 'rpi' or 'arm' in their names as they have likely been adapted for that system.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling Niel Eyde's Raspberry Pi versions of Node-RED from DockerHub as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/">nieleyde/rpi-nodered</a>. It has all sorts of interesting modules that I had not previously built.</p>

<p>Node-RED is at 0.10.6 at this writing. Its <a href="http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi support</a> includes hardware support using <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">WiringPi</a> to access the GPIO pins. </p>

<p>Node-RED currently supports Node.JS 0.10. Node.JS and IO.JS have <a href="http://sdtimes.com/node-js-and-io-js-to-merge-under-node-js-foundation/">merged forces</a> after a fork, which means hopefully development will start to be sane again.</p>

<p>That all said I am not sure I have everything I need yet but as a leap forward it's pretty good!</p>

      <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.</p>

<p>For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. </p>

<p>For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. I'm especially happy about the Sony because I had feared that it was a complicated repair. There's some corrosion on the battery terminals and I might be forewarned that would be the first thing to look at again. A discussion of another repair is written up by <a href="http://idlenot.com/?p=1481">KE1RI</a> to replace an audio capacitor, fortunately I haven't had to do that.</p>

<p>Both stations are tuned to R Havana Cuba's Sunday night programming on 6000 KHz.</p>

      <p>The rented lakes of my childhood 
 by Marge Piercy </p>

<pre>
 I remember the lakes of my Michigan
 childhood. Here they are called ponds.
 Lakes belonged to summer, two-week
 vacations that my father was granted by
 Westinghouse when we rented some cabin.

 Never mind the dishes with spiderweb
 cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce
 pans, the crusted black frying pans.
 Never mind the mattresses shaped
 like the letter V. Old jangling springs.

 Moldy bathrooms. Low ceilings
 that leaked. The lakes were mysteries
 of sand and filmy weeds and minnows
 flickering through my fingers. I rowed
 into freedom. Alone on the water

 that freckled into small ripples,
 that raised its hackles in storms,
 that lay glassy at twilight reflecting
 the sunset then sucking up the dark,
 I was unobserved as the quiet doe

 coming with her fauns to drink
 on the opposite shore. I let the row-
 boat drift as the current pleased, lying
 faceup like a photographer’s plate
 the rising moon turned to a ghost.

 And though the voices called me
 back to the rented space we shared
 I was sure I left my real self there-
 a tiny black pupil in the immense
 eye of a silver pool of silence.

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.</p>

<p>I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city's employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained. The city has hired a contractor to handle the building official's role, but that contractor is not working on the day of this meeting. </p>

<p>The group's meetings are in Legistar, which I looked at at 8:30 a.m. today before a 1:30 p.m. meeting. Legistar should have details and staff reports for all of the items on the agenda, but as of 8:30 a.m. there was only the barest detail listed, with five parcels under review but no detail for any of those parcels and no information about old business to be reviewed. Several members of the board noted that they did not get any email from the building department reminding them that there was going to be a meeting, let alone informing them of the agenda.</p>

<p>When I got to the meeting at 1:30 p.m. I find that one of the items was removed from the agenda (that's pretty typical) and there was a bare minimum of documentation for the other four items. Bare minimum in this case included photos but no writeup of the staff recommendation and no detail at all. There were also two surprise agenda items under old business, neither of which had any written supporting documentation.</p>

<p>At the meeting itself there was a fair amount of confusion. One unfortunate petitioner who was asking for a variance for basement apartment filled out his form asking for this as a Housing Board of Appeals request, but then someone (the petitioner or the city, not sure who) whited out the word "Housing" and replaced it with "Building". Some substantial amount of time was spent sorting out which appeals board actually would address the appeal, and the petitioner felt that it should be the Housing Board of Appeals that would address a variance for occupancy.</p>

<p>Of course that discovers another problem. The Housing Board of Appeals, as currently constituted, has three members; but seven are specified by charter, and thus it does not have a quorum and cannot meet.</p>

<p>What kind of Kafkaesque city do we live in where matters are best referred to a body that cannot meet!</p>

<p>I spoke up at public commentary at the end of the meeting, there being no opportunity to speak at the beginning, pointing out some of this sad state of affairs and especially encouraging the board to prepare more carefully for meetings in such a way that members of the public would be able to avail themselves of information about the matters coming before the board. Certainly there is public interest in some of the long-term dilapidated buildings that have come before the board - in particular 410 Miller, which has been a mess as long as I can recall - but there being no adequate agenda publicized there is no way for the public to be even aware that a discussion is going on.</p>

<p>When is Ann Arbor going to have a full time building official? Without someone in an official position to make the department work, the city's systems for handling exceptional cases appears to be entirely and completely broken. I can only imagine that routine issues are under a similar sort of chaotic pressure.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it's running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it's also quite economical.</p>

<p>That said, there's one feature on the phone that wasn't a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him. The phone has wifi calling so it should have worked just fine where I was, a spot that has poor cell reception. But the call never came, and by the time I idly checked my messages I had missed several calls. How did that happen?</p>

<p>Windows Phone and Cortana has a feature called Quiet Hours. In <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-quiet-hours-and-inner-circles-windows-phone-81">How to set up Quiet Hours and Inner Circles on Windows Phone 8.1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsabri">Sam Sabri</a> writes for Windows Central a nice tutorial on how to set it up and configure the phone to not ring during some hours of the day and to allow some people to specially ring the phone even when it's set to no ring. It's a good tutorial, and if I had read it carefully and thought it through I could have set it up to always take calls from important people late at night.</p>

<p>The truth is, though, that I already have another phone system (Google Voice) that I could already use to reroute or divert calls, and having that power in my phone though nice is the opposite of what I wanted. If it's late and someone calls me, I want to take the call. So my suggestion to you for your new Windows Phone is - if you want to use it as a phone - that you start out your device setup by disabling Quiet Hours, and only add it back in once you have thought it through very carefully.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, May 5, 2015, 2:00 a.m. I spoke with Jim Payeur, fire chief for the Chelsea Area Fire Authority, about the gas pipeline explosion in a 20" gas transmission line in a wooded area near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road about five miles north of Chelsea, Michigan. The incident occurred at about 10:30 p.m. on May 4, when about 20 people reported a sound like a jet crash. There was no fire at the scene and no injuries reported. Some nearby residents were evacuated from their homes and sheltered at Lyndon Township Hall. Chief Payeur had "no clue" why the pipeline ruptured, and said that a crew from Consumers Energy was working on site. The scene has been cleared and residents have been allowed to return to their homes.</p>

<p>This is my final update for tonight.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:29 a.m. Called Huron Valley Ambulance (fire dispatch), was told that they were "not allowed to give out any information". The below map is from PHMSA and shows the routes of gas pipelines in the area.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:10 a.m. First hand account says they told people with a half mile to leave. Report that the fire could be heard from three miles away. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>Ann Arbor, MI, May 5, 2015, 12:37 a.m. Reports of a fire in a 20 inch gas main in Lyndon Township north of Chelsea, MI near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language. Learning a new language from scratch is not the easy task, but with news reports you're not really trying to learn the language at all, just to read the text like a "bookbreaker" would read it if they were <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/How_the_Germans.pdf">decoding a secret code</a>.</p>

<p>So, Nepali news, sad all of it. Lots of photos are online, some video. Active message traffic via amateur radio is on 20 meters, which you can monitor at a <a href="http://websdr.org">WebSDR</a> station. Trying to find a good DX monitoring spot for Nepali transmissions.</p>

<p>The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I'm looking at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn't have school and so I didn't actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.</p>

<p>The first piece of the new routine is getting to the <a href="http://www.annarborymca.org/">Ann Arbor YMCA</a>. If the weather is nice and I don't have anything else going on, it's a nice bike ride; if I'm making a car trip into town for school, it's close enough to be a good next stop. The only slight problem with the Y during the day is parking, not that I'd spend money on parking, but that everyone knows to park on West Washington St. There's nothing quite like a sauna in the morning to get you going, and there's a lovely little library by the pool with a very fast wifi and good power outlets.</p>

<p>The second piece of the new routine is <a href="http://www.argusfarmstop.com/">Argus Farm Stop</a>. I had been in here when it first opened, but now the routine has settled down a bit, and after the 8:00 a.m - 9:00 a.m. coffee rush it's a pretty reasonable spot to sit and type. There's delicious day-old bread to be had at reasonable prices and they will lop off an end for you to chew on while you drink your coffee. As a bonus the parking on Second St usually has a free space on one side or another at 8:00 a.m. so I can walk to the Y, do my thing, walk back, sit for a bit and type some more, and be good to go by 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>The conversation at the Farm Stop is sparkling - talked to a fellow named Granger who's moving here from Colorado about food, where to get a good bi bim bap, and his plans with his friends to open up a glass shop in town. [Kathy Sample] was behind the counter sorting out the morning flow and talking about the farmers bringing in their produce and their meats.</p>

<p>Between those two changes I now can pretty much count on being bathed, fed, watered, and have a little bit of shopping done by 10:00 a.m. If the weather is nice, I get a bike ride in to start the day, and I haven't spent any pennies on parking, and it also works to take the bus.</p>

      <p>After three or four years of planning to get Skywarn training, this year I finally did it. The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.</p>

<p>I was there with John Hritz KD8MKE and Ann Hanson. Ann captured the opening slide. There was a nifty online multiplayer game (can't recall the site it was built on) which had 95 people playing along from their smart phones!</p>

<p>I brought my radio to the event and made a contact from the car with Marty KD8RGL from Canton MI. We were both using 5 watt radios contacting the W8UM repeater in Ann Arbor - I'm always surprised how well things work when they do work.</p>

<p>I discovered that it works a lot better to identify myself as "Eddie" when on the air. This because "Ed" gets misinterpreted as "Andy" all too often, and "Edward" seems awfully formal.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.</p>

<p>After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. Same form factor, bright blue in color, and the supplied antenna is a retractable whip with a magnetic base. As always it comes with no documentation and no software (you are expected to provide those).</p>

<p>I had previously used a version of "gqrx" as a radio receiver, in a package that had been built for the Mac. This time I thought I'd build from source. I went to the 'homebrew' port system and found a version that said it worked for OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), but I'm on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and the build didn't work (it crapped out in building scipy). Reading the documentation more closely the distribution says it's available through Macports, so I installed that and did "sudo port install gnuradio" and "sudo port install gqrx".</p>

<p>Macports is one of those amazing feats of modern software engineering where someone (or really a lot of people) have carefully and meticulously figured out how to take a package of source code and make it build, including tracing all of the dependencies upon which everything else needs to be built. For gqrx and GNU Radio this means (at the very bottom) that I had to have a working FORTRAN compiler so that I could compile the FORTRAN code hiding in the numerical analysis libraries. This brings me right back to the 1970s learning FORTRAN at Michigan Tech in their Summer Youth Program. I can't even imagine how old the code was that I compiled but it might actually date from then.</p>

<p>Everything did build just fine, and then I had a radio. The first test is always to tune into WCBN, which came in with a strong signal, and to key up my ham radio transmitter via Echolink to make the W8UM repeater make some noise, and to get some weather radio going. Everything I tried worked just fine and passed with flying colors, the gqrx software is more modern than it once was in a couple of very helpful ways.</p>

<p>Next was to grab one of the many versions of "dump1090" which uses the SDR radio to tune to aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that give you a version of aircraft radar. This also worked well, perhaps better than I could have expected. From home with an antenna in the middle of the house I could hear airplanes just north of Jackson, MI from Ann Arbor, MI (about 40 miles). I relocated to a cafe near the dog park (Ellsworth at Platt) that has a good view of the southern sky, and the same little bitty antenna pulled in reception from airplanes near Fort Wayne, IN (about 120 miles). </p>

<p>There's always more to try, of course. GNU Radio is a full toolkit for building your own radio design, complete with FM decoders and the like, and it has a fairly simple to understand user interface compared to how complex the underpinnings are (remember, FORTRAN). There's lots more software that uses the RTL-SDR libraries and even a port to the Raspberry Pi which I'd like to try.</p>

      <p>My Twitter feed was full of air crash news this morning. Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all passengers aboard. Wikipedia has a <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Germanwings_Flight_9525">good summary</a>, perhaps as good as any.</p>

<p>What was unusual about the crash was that there was no distress call, and that the plane descended rapidly and steadily into the ground without veering once from its course.</p>

<p>Of note in this regard is another European flight on a similar aircraft some months earlier. Lufthansa 1829 on Nov 5th 2014 lost 4000 feet/minute of altitude after having problems with its control systems. The <a href="http://avherald.com/h?article=47d74074">Aviation Herald story</a> was written a few days later, and it references emergency airworthiness directive <a href="http://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/easa_ad_2014_0266_E.pdf/EAD_2014-0266-E_1">2014-0266-E_1 (pdf)</a>. <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=171411">AviationSafety.net has a summary of that incident</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During climb, 12 NM NW of Pamplona, at approximately Flight Level 310, the aircraft unexpectedly decreased the pitch autonomous and started to descend. The aircraft reached a rate of descent of up to 4,000 ft/min. The crew was able to stop the descent at Flight Level 270. The flight was continued and the aircraft landed safely at its destination Munich Airport. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least superficially the incidents seem related. I am not expert enough at aviation issues to know if there is a real connection, or if this is mere coincidence.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman's Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones.</p>

<p>The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map.</p>

<p>As always with these discussions the question turned to what data there might be available to look at, and how to get it. That led us to questions of what other people were doing with municipal data in other cities, and to this New York City parking ticket analysis: <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/87573867759/success-how-nyc-open-data-and-reddit-saved-new">Success: How NYC Open Data and Reddit Saved New Yorkers Over $55,000 a Year</a>. It seems that there was a parking space in New York that looked like it was a legal spot, but turned out to be frequently ticketed because it was near a fire hydrant. After some analysis and publicity by Ben Wellington of I Quant NY, the NYC DOT repainted the stripes on the street to clearly mark this spot as a no-go.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, how would you repeat this analysis for Ann Arbor, and what would you look for? Where are there locations that frequently generate tickets, what do they look like on a map, and how much ticket revenue comes per space?  And in the public interest, are there any spots that generate disproportionate ticket frequencies that should be looked at carefully to improve signage?</p>

<p>It looks like a project. In New York there's a data catalog that includes this data set and many others; no such data has been released in Ann Arbor. So the first step is understanding what the process is for getting a year or two of ticket data to start analyzing it.</p>

<p>Update: here's a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_wellington_how_we_found_the_worst_place_to_park_in_new_york_city_using_big_data?language=en">TED Talk by Ben Wellington</a> on "How we found the worst place to park in New York City -- using big data".</p>

<p>I first got word that there was a chance of northern lights from the <a href="http://mivus.org/">Michigan VHF-UHF Society mailing list</a>, an amateur radio group. When the aurora activity is high, the VHF amateur radio bands (2 meter and 6 meter) get increased range, so ham radio operators with this interest keep an alert out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/">The Aurora Page at Michigan Tech</a> has a lot of useful links to space weather forecasts.</p>

<p>Alas no sign of or reports of northern lights in Ann Arbor - we don't exactly have a dark sky, but the storm was also not strong enough for any reports this far south.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility company. I know it won't be a perfect boundary (most utility companies have at least one county that they only provide service to part of), but as a start it's a pretty good one.</p>

<p>The DOE data is based on their Form EIA-861, and I'm working from the 2013 data set. See <a href="http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/">Electric power sales, revenue, and energy efficiency Form EIA-861 detailed data files</a> if you want to get your own files. It's provided as Excel (XLSX) files, so you'll need something compatible to read them; I ended up using <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/in2csv.html">in2csv from csvkit</a> as the first part of the pipeline to break these apart.</p>

<p>You get lines from the provided file that look like this:</p>

<pre>
Data Year,Utility Number,Utility Name,State,County
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Shiawassee
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,St Clair
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Tuscola
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Washtenaw
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Wayne
</pre>

<p>The next challenge is to pull a map for each county served. To do this, convert the (State,County) list to a FIPS code, using a table like this one from ORNL called <a href="http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/CoFIPS00.txt">CoFIPS00.txt</a>. (MI,Washtenaw) turns into 26161. Feed a list of FIPS codes into the Census Reporter geo API, and out comes GeoJSON files, like so: <a href="http://api.censusreporter.org/1.0/geo/show/tiger2013?geo_ids=05000US26103,05000US26003">GeoJSON for Marquette and Alger Counties, Michigan</a>. </p>

<p>We have a list of counties for each utility, so at minimum we're set right there. But we need to get 2935 of them, and it's kind of slow to wait for each one to return before fetching the next one. That motivates the use of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>, a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel. On my four core MacBook Air I ran 32 jobs in parallel, and 2935 fetches (using "curl") took 287 seconds with the median elapsed time for each job at about 3 seconds - about a 31x speedup vs doing things serially.</p>

<p>However, the GeoJSON provided is really one shape per county, and we're looking for a complete service area in a single shape, so we need to merge the result together. Here a useful tool is the "R" stats package, particularly the "rgeos", "rgdal", and "maptools" packages. </p>

<p>The first step is the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/ogrInfo">readOGR() function from the rgdal library</a>. It takes a variety of input map formats including GeoJSON and shape files and pulls them into a Spatial vector object in R. rgdal is an R interface to Frank Warmerdam's <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a>, and it handles both raster and vector geospatial data formats.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/maptools/docs/unionSpatialPolygons">unionSpatialPolygons() function from the maptools library</a> to merge the county polygons into a single polygon. The docs say that this is a wrapper around the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gUnion">gUnion() function from the rgeos library</a>. rgeos comes from the Google Summer of Code 2010, and this <a href="https://gsoc2010r.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/rgeos-introduction/">introduction to the project</a> explains the motivation. rgeos provides an R interface to <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>, which is in turn a C++ port of <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html">JTS</a>, the Java Topology Suite.</p>

<p>After you run the unionSpatialPolygons() operation, you will inevitably find that there are tiny holes in your unioned map. Geographic boundaries are complex, and as a result there are often little areas that don't quite touch, leaving little bits of land that aren't included anywhere. This algorithm from stackoverflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12663263/dissolve-holes-in-polygon-in-r">Dissolve holes in polygon in R</a>, takes care of the issue. </p>

<pre>
G.rings = Filter(function(f){f@ringDir==1},G.union@polygons[[1]]@Polygons)
G.bounds = SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(G.rings,ID=1)))
</pre>

<p>As the Polygon documentation note for ringDir: "the ring direction of the ring (polygon) coordinates, holes are expected to be anti-clockwise"</p>

<p>Having done this cleanup work, we return a GeoJSON file with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/leafletR/functions/toGeoJSON">toGeoJSON() function from the leafletR package</a>. Now I probably don't need to pull in all of leafletR; there's a <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/writeOGR">writeOGR() function in the rgdal package</a> that should also do the same work. The aside, though, is that <a href="https://github.com/chgrl/leafletR">leafletR</a> creates nice maps in R using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library.</p>

<p>With all that done, we have a new GeoJSON file that's a cleaned up merge of multiple county outlines done in R. However, the process isn't quite done. Some of the merged files don't have holes, but they do have "slivers", little angular bits of geometry from where two counties don't quite touch at their corners. I didn't find an algorithm to unsliver in R, but this <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/120286/removing-small-polygons-gaps-in-a-shapely-polygon">Removing small polygons gaps in a Shapely polygon</a> did the trick. </p>

<pre>
# Here's the algorithm
fx = poly.buffer(eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre).buffer(-eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre)
</pre>

<p><a href="http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html">Shapely</a> from Sean Gilles is a "Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library." So we're back to GEOS, which is also supported by R...which means I suspect this algorithm translates directly back into R by proper invocation of the equivalent <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gBuffer">gBuffer() function from the rgeos package</a>.</p>

<p>No matter, I installed Shapely. It's pretty fast, and if I had time to refine this operation I'd try to port all of the R code back into python using Shapely to see if I could get a meaningful speedup improvement.</p>

<p>All this description! Here's the code.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/vielmetti/13f6feae14111ff1c148">unsliver.py</a> - in Python with the Shapely library</li>

</pre>

<p>So, progress.</p>

<p>One process, written in python, takes an Excel file provided by the county and creates a GeoJSON file from it. Addresses in the file are geocoded. The original file has a set of restaurant inspection reports and three kinds of inspection problems found; I add a fourth "score" variable that's derived in some way from those three.</p>

<p>A second process (code above) is in R using the LeafletR graphing package. It in turn takes the GeoJSON file as originally provided, and writes an HTML file that reads it using the Leaflet maps package.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the result is below:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" title="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Some big caveats.</p>

<p>My color palette is all wrong - I need to think that through. </p>

<p>This process is based on a single monthly Excel file, and should be updated to include all recent inspections and not just a single month.</p>

<p>The map needs labels of some sort. (How they will look when everything is smushed together, don't know.)</p>

<p>It would be nice to have HTML links to the Arborwiki page for each restaurant, and to a deep link for the inspections itself.</p>

<p>The geocoder is a bit slow, and I should cache previous results so that it goes faster in future months.</p>

<p>RESTAURANT NAMES ARE IN ALL CAPS AND THAT'S SHOUTING.</p>

<p>Leaflet can do all sorts of things and I've hardly scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I probably could do this all in R - or all in Python - but I'm trying to spin up on both systems &amp; thus really want to use each for what they are good at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don't ask me why.) Here's some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more.</p>

<p>First, some prior art. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Tactile-Feedback-Compass-Belt/">How to make a tactile compass feedback belt</a> is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt. When you're pointing in a certain direction, the belt vibrates in that spot, and you get a continuous sense of direction. <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/esp.html">Wired Magazine wrote this up in 2007</a>, and the invention of the "feelSpace belt" is credited to Osnabrück cognitive scientist Peter König. Here's a CBC interview with Peter König from 2014.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.cbc.ca/i/caffeine/syndicate/?clipId=2626883935" width="620" height="348" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If you look at the designs for these magnetic belts, you quickly discover that the electronics to detect direction are relatively straightforward, and that there are lots of wires and buzzers that you have to harness together. So the question I have is whether there's a better way to encode direction that doesn't require a dozen motors! You'd think that you could use a code on a single vibrotactile device to "tap out" a direction, or use a pair of devices to encode "northiness" and "eastiness" to give the whole code with two points instead of a dozen. There would be a training time to learn this, and it might be less obvious than a single motor pointing north. The evident advantage of the two-motor approach over the twelve-motor approach is that the wearable device could be very small.</p>

<p>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it's cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate.</p>

<p>I thought I'd use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch.</p>

<p>The setup:</p>

<p>Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag. I'm using RabbitMQ as my MQTT message passing system, but that's not strictly necessary for this application.</p>

<p>The Macbook has support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is what the Sensortag talks. Support for BLE in Node-RED is provided by the "noble" module, which the "sensortag" module uses to communicate with the device. Freeboard is a visualization dashboard with some simple widgets to display data coming to it.</p>

<p>This report on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dceejay/fb47301b759222e05f84">how to use the Freeboard dashboard with Node-RED</a> has all of the difficult parts. It provides a websocket listener for Freeboard, and you use the built-in websocket transmitter on Node-RED. There's a very tiny bit of logic to pull apart the data coming off the Sensortag; it could probably be less if I were more clever.</p>

<p>The Node-RED code looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>and the very simple dashboard I put together to test this looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>There's a catch to using the TI Sensortag; it sometimes turns itself off, to save battery. To correct this you can install new firmware on the device to disable the battery saving mode. The folks at MyWeatherCenter provide a <a href="http://www.myweathercenter.net/installing-a-new-firmware-for-ti-sensortag/">link to their firmware</a> which deals with the issue, at the cost of lower battery life. </p>

<p>The results: the windows are way, way colder than the inside air (about 45 degrees), but the curtains read much warmer (about 60 degrees). Thermal curtains for the win!</p>

<p>As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People's Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/01/downtown_ann_arbors_vellum_to.html">Ann Arbor News story</a> tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.</p>

<p>What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. County health officials took a dim view of this, as seen in this excerpt from a <a href="http://www.healthinspection.info/establishments/1364">health inspection in February 2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Critical) Found a package of meat in a vacuum sealed package, and found beef short rib in a vacuum sealed package in the basement meat walk in cooler. These packages were the same size as the vacuum package supply in facility, and did not appear to be commercial products as there were no labels and pic could not provide any statements or boxes indicating from a commercial licensed source. Pic corrected by discarding meats in vacuum sealed packages. Found a piece of meat in a vacuum sealed package with " 140 degrees 4 and half hours" written on package in the walk in cooler. Pic states he does not know what marking mean and where this came from. Pic corrected by discarding meat. Found several pieces of sous vide equipment in the basement and main kitchen areas. Found at least 5 boxes of packages for vacuum packaging on the shelf in the basement prep area, and was denied access to room/closet next to shelf with vacuum packaging. To correct verify that no one in facility is using vacuum sealer or preparing food using sous vide method as a variance is required. This violation has repeated and a risk control plan is required to be submitted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your innovative kitchen depends on methods that are in violation of regulations, it's going to be hard to keep up the buzz when you have to give them up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.</p>

<p>Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.</p>

<p>The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. Expect the neighborliness issue to be a substantial point of discussion.</p>

<p>The downtown zoning plans revolve around the changes proposed to what's now a parking lot next to the DTE building on S Main St. The parcel abuts a residential neighborhood and the neighbors don't particularly want a giant building to the west looming over their back yards.</p>

<p>On the consent agenda is approval of an emergency repair to the city's tower truck in the sum of $64,464.93 which is to repair damage from an accident on October 31, 2014. The fire department has brought its 18 year old previous tower unit back into service in reserve, according to the city administrator's notes accompanying the purchase order approval request.</p>

<p>Council will take up the issue of rezoning of a parcel at 3601 Plymouth Road to allow the construction of a Plum Market on the land most recently occupied by Cleary University.</p>

<p>It should be an early night at council.</p>

</p>

<p>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65 pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into the machine.</p>

<p>Graveraet Middle School in Marquette had one of these, presumably discarded from its use in the school administration. By 1977 the machine was so completely obsolete that it sat idle, with no one knowing how it worked. I got plenty of time to spend with the system, and frankly I never really figured it out either. It was easy enough to use it as an adding and multiplying and dividing machine, but the mysteries of its program logic escaped me.</p>

<p>There are several folks who have active projects to restore the old system, including a project at the DataMuseum in Denmark. <a href="http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Olivetti/Programma_101/Revive">See their efforts here.</a> There are quite a lot of mechanical parts in this old machine, including a set of 8 pulleys that drove the various bits of the card reader and the printer. Rubber rollers of course get old and decayed with time so every account of a restoration has some discussion of that repair.</p>

<p>The photo at the top is from Michigan Tech, written by James D. Spain, who outlines the use of the Programma 101 <a href="http://blogs.mtu.edu/biological/2012/03/origins-of-the-computer-simulation-program-in-biology-at-michigan-tech/">in the biology program at Tech in 1969.</a></p>

      <p>As of this writing (2 am Sunday December 28 2014 in Ann Arbor MI) there is no word on the fate of the lost airliner Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 which went missing on a flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. </p>

<p>Trying to find reliable information about an event in progress half way around the world is always a challenge. Twitter and Facebook are good at moving information quickly around the globe, but they send sense and nonsense in equal parts, and it's easy to read things that are speculation or even outright falsehoods.</p>

<p>Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_AirAsia_Flight_8501">Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501</a> warns "Initial news reports may be unreliable". At the moment the page is up to date with as much of the fragments of news that have been made available, and it links to "unconfirmed and speculative early reports" that speak of wreckage being found.</p>

<p>Much less reputable are the reports of Russia Today and China's CCTV which take rumor as fact.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every month I get an email with a spreadsheet of restaurant inspection reports from Washtenaw County. Here's a summary of the worst (and best) of the restaurants inspected in November 2014.</p>

<p>There are three types of problems reported by county health. To simplify reporting I score them proportionately to see which locations go to the top of the list. </p>

<p>6 locations had no problems at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>DOG DAYS III  2515 JACKSON    ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>DOMINICK'S    812 MONROE  ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>HOTEL HICKMAN WILD WEST ADVENTURES STFU   2400 HICKMAN RD ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>JIMMY JOHN'S GOURMET SANDWICHES   342 S. STATE STREET ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>OCED SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM 2025 E. CLARK ROAD  YPSILANTI</li>
<li>WETZEL'S PRETZELS 100 BRIARWOOD CIRCLE K108   ANN ARBOR</li>
</ul>

<p>By far and away the worst restaurant is Tim Horton's on 760 S Hewitt Rd in Ypsilanti, with 9 priority violations, 8 priority foundation violations, and 14 core violations. 
This sums it up (all caps in original)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL IS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED IN THE FACILITY AS EVIDENCED BY EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY HANDWASHING, EMPLOYEES ARE MONITORING FOOD TEMPERATURES, PROPERLY WASHING AND SANITIZING CLEANED MULTIUSE EQUIPMENT AND UTENSILS BEFORE THEY ARE REUSED, MONITORING DISHWASHING PROCEDURES.

<p>The <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tim-hortons-ypsilanti">Yelp reviews for this place</a> share some of the horrors.</p>

<p>Bill S.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disgusting - worst sandwich I have ever purchased in my life. Dried out chicken that tasted like it bad been sitting around for 3 days. Threw it out after 2 bites. Would have asked for a refund but didn't want to deal with the aggravated and stressed out staff running the place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mia M: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, the same person is running the drive thru window. She's rude and I overhear conversations that make me question the cleanliness inside the restaurant. "Grab a wet rag and pretend you wiped down the tables." "Put a towel on it and we'll clean it up later." Or my personal favorite, "We're out of coffee [and it's 8 o'clock in the morning.]" </p>

      </h3>
      <p>From Scientific American, [For Sale: “Your Name Here” in a Prestigious Science Journal] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. "Begger's funnel plot" appears to be an accidental hybrid of the two names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem? A steep rise in the number of "meta-analysis" papers published in China, many of which seem to be following a common template for reporting results - including sharing typographic errors, mis-attribution, and formulaic text. </p>

<p>The best ongoing reporting on dishonesty in the scientific literature is <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> from Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus. Filion's post on <a href="http://blog.thegrandlocus.com/2014/10/a-flurry-of-copycats-on-pubmed">A flurry of copycats on PubMed</a> digs deeper into the problem, studying the copycat formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real shock came when we downloaded the papers. Most are behind paywalls, so we could access only 25 of them. There was no need for more, the pattern was very clear from the third study. The papers have exactly the same structure, with the same figures in the same order. The last figure of each paper is a “Begger’s funnel plot”, featuring a surrealistic fusion of Begg and Egger (Colin Begg and Matthias Egger both gave their name to a test for publication bias). What struck me the most was the similarity in the aesthetics of the figures, the same line widths, the same colors, the same shapes etc.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.</p>

<p>The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. Note that broadcasts in English are not 24 hours a day, and that shortwave reception varies widely by time of day and location of receiving station.</p>

<p>The key to do this is to acquaint yourself with <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a>, a project that allows multiple listeners to tune into the signal of a single wideband radio. You'll need to pick a receiver that has an antenna that covers the appropriate part of the broadcast band, and you'll need also a schedule for when the station is broadcasting.</p>

<p>Many shortwave schedules and stations can be located via <a href="http://www.short-wave.info/">short-wave.info</a>.  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" title="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Given a schedule and a frequency, use WebSDR to find a suitable listening location. My two favorites for monitoring Havana are the original <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">WedSDR at U Twente</a> and <a href="http://96.225.100.244:8902/">K2SDR in New Jersey</a>. </p>

<p>Of course you can tune in via <a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Havana-Cuba-p1687/">TuneIn</a> and get to the broadcast direct. The sound will be more clear, and the reception more reasonable. But there's really something to be said for experiencing broadcast radio through the medium of radio rather than this newfangled Internet thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Dr. Dobb's Journal is closing down, with its last issue appearing at the end of 2014. They <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">tell their story</a> in a final report.</p>

<p>The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side, our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My memory of reading Dr. Dobb's dates back to the early 1990s, when it was a source for careful writing (complete with source code) on programming issues of the day. Now days there's an infinite supply of technical writing on the net, so it's not surprising that ad revenues dried up (or more pointedly got concentrated on Google the gatekeeper for much of online traffic).</p>

<p>"Running light without overbyte" was their first slogan. You can pick up a first edition of their compiled first year of publication (1976) from <a href="http://www.kuenzigbooks.com/pages/books/22185/dr-dobb/dr-dobbs-journal-of-computer-calisthenics-orthodontia-running-light-without-overbyte-volume-one">Kuenzig Books</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.</p>

<p>websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. There are websdr servers running around the globe, each tuned in to some particular slice of the radio waves. Multiple people can tune in at the same time and hear their own piece of the airwaves.</p>

<p>The interesting thing happens when you connect these two systems together. Some small number of the websdr receivers tune into the 2 meter band, which is the typical band used by Echolink. Using Echolink (or in my case the Mac application Echomac) I identified an Echolink host in the vicinity of the websdr receiver, then connected to it. Sure enough, I was able to hear my call sign back in through the websdr front end.</p>

<p>This little image shows the result. Transmitted via DM0ZHS, and monitored at http://129.187.5.188:8901/ on 145237.50 kHz, I'm sending from Isen, Germany and receiving the transmission at the Olympic Tower in Munich, Germany.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gall, John C. 9/18/1925 - 12/15/2014 Walker, MN John C. Gall, Jr.,
beloved husband, father, pediatrician, scholar and author, passed
away with his wife by his side Dec. 15, 2014, in Walker, MN, from
natural causes. He was 89. John was born on September 18, 1925 in
Washington, D.C. and grew up near Upperville, VA. In 1945 he was
drafted into the Army Air Corps and sent to Germany, where he served
as a medic in the Allied army of occupation. During his tour of
duty he attended the Nuremberg trials, which kindled in him a
lifelong passion to heal the afflicted and promote justice. Upon
returning home he furthered his education, graduating from Yale and
George Washington University Medical School. He was a postdoctorate
fellow at the Mayo Clinic, where he was dubbed &ldquo;the best pediatric
diagnostician [they had] ever seen!&rdquo; In addition he earned a
certification in Human Genetics and completed 7 years of therapy
training. Dr. Gall began his medical career as a researcher at the
University of Virginia, followed by a 3-year stint at the Geisinger
Clinic in Danville, PA. He next went into private practice in Miles
City, MT, but was soon invited to teach at the University of Michigan
Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. There he also served as head of
the Plymouth State Home, where he did research partially funded by
the Kennedy family foundation, and named and described several
syndromes of the developmentally disabled . In addition he established
a long-running private pediatric practice of 38 years. During this
period he developed a special appreciation for, and an enduring
interest in, the importance of nonverbal communication between very
young children and their parents. This led him to expand his practice
to include support and education classes, in which he was aided by
his late wife, Beth, and then by his wife Carol. Their observations
and anecdotes are included in Elegant Parenting, written with wife,
Beth; in Dancing with Elves written by John, and with wife Carol
he wrote Hit by a Low-Flying Goose. John&rsquo;s best known book is System
Antics, later published under the title The Systems Bible, a humorous
but insightful study of the problems and pitfalls that afflict every
type of system that human beings create-whether mechanical, economic,
corporate, aeronautical, legal, linguistic, religious, medical or
electronic. It was first published in 1976 by the New York
Times/Quadrangle Press and has been translated (officially or
unofficially) into at least 14 languages. He lectured widely
throughout the United States and was interviewed by the Voice of
America on nuclear proliferation issues after its publication. John
and Carol were both invited to speak in London in 2012 to a group
of CEOs and other executives from around the world and John was
introduced as &ldquo;The Grandfather of Systems Theory.&rdquo; He retired to
Walker, MN, in 2001 in search of privacy and uninterrupted time,
which he used to write seven other books, including a novel, First
Queen, plus books and video books on parenting and the art of
pediatric practice. He was very proud that the great Swiss psychiatrist,
Alice Miller, who introduced the world to the subject of child
sexual abuse, endorsed his work before she died. His work has also
been endorsed by others too numerous to name, but including such
luminaries as the head of the Dept. of Psychology at Cambridge,
University, who forwarded his material to several British social
service agencies. In the late 1990s John helped to write the National
Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Exam in Washington D.C several years
running. More recently he was invited to Washington D.C. by a
government psychiatrist and consulted with this man on the development
of psychological profiles of moles (double agents). He also spoke
at a symposium at Princeton University entitled &ldquo;Children under the
Shadow of War.&rdquo; The group included scholars from around the world,
and filmmakers who had photographed kidnapped children who had been
conscripted into war and forced to commit atrocities. It was John&rsquo;s
job to deliver the final speech, summarizing and tying together all
of the presentations. This was the only lecture open to the public.
John gave a moving presentation that left not a dry eye in the
audience. In the final months of his life, John continued to think
and write actively on a wide range of subjects. Most recently he
completed a 4th edition of Systemantics and contributed, with other
international scholars, to a book on Panarchy, due to be published
in 2015. John was preceded in death by his first wife, Beth, and
three step-grandsons, Michael Nelson, and Franklin and Alexander

      </h3>
      <p>Nothing personal, but it's time to take a break from Twitter.</p>

<p>I tried to do this <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">back in 2008</a> when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates.</p>

<p>I have a few bots that tweet out weather updates which I guess I will keep running because it's more trouble than it's worth to temporarily turn them off. </p>

	Recreating more or less my original layout, but with 
	dynamically loaded content. I guess that could work!
