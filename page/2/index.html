<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>A few notes from MLK Day.</p>

<p>A morning trip to Roos Roast, enjoying a cup of Portland in the 90s coffee
and a hard boiled egg from Farmer John&rsquo;s Our Family Farm.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan Men&rsquo;s Glee Club, singing at the annual
MLK Day symposium at the U of M, monitored via a remote video feed.</p>

<p>A bus trip to the UM Computer and Video Game Archive, in the basement
of the Duderstadt Center, for some quality time with my 10 yo and a
chance to play Centipede and Driver San Francisco.</p>

<p>A walk across the N Campus Diag (under construction) to the W8UM shack
in the EECS building, where I talked to Steve K8QKY who was working
a station that was on a DXpedition to the S Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>The bus trip was fine business as well - on the way there I talked to
W8TAM and the return trip was a QSO with KB6NU.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-17-qso-on-redditnet/">QSO on redditnet via Geekshed IRC</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The #redditnet channel on the <a href="http://www.geekshed.net/">Geekshed IRC network</a>
is full of amateur radio operators from the /r/amateurradio network on Reddit.
People seem to be friendly and knowledgable and more likely than not
to be actually doing digital modes on their radio rather than talking
about that.</p>

<p>The channel practice is tolerant of people treating it as thought
it were a CW or RTTY frequency, complete with contest style behavior
and reception reports (you are always 59 on #redditnet). I haven&rsquo;t
ever done contesting myself for lack of appropriate gear, but I&rsquo;m
starting to see the appeal.</p>

<p>IRC was formally defined by RFC 1459 in 1993, but it dates from 1988
and was inspired by the earlier BITNET Relay network of 1985. Unlike
the Unix based Usenet network, which focused on email-sized messages,
the IRC network is fundamentally about short messages and also about
considerable autonomy among separate non-federated servers. It&rsquo;s because
of this that IRC has been relatively resistant to the spam that overran
Usenet.</p>

<p>Thanks to Thom <a href="http://aprs.fi/info/a/W8TAM-1">W8TAM</a> for alerting me to this net,
and Dan <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/">KB6NU</a> has a nice writeup

      </h3>
      <p>APRS is the &ldquo;Automatic Position Reporting Service&rdquo;, a
system for sharing information about the position of
participating amateur radio stations. Clients transmit
position reports on 144.39 Mhz; digipeaters repeat
these reports to other monitoring stations; and various
IGate sites monitor transmissions and send their findings
to <a href="http://aprs.fi">aprs.fi</a> which collects worldwide data.</p>

<p>In recent memory there has been an APRS digipeater in
Chelsea, Michigan with wide area coverage, good enough
to pick up travellers on I-94 west of Ann Arbor.
The Chelsea digirepeater is currently off the air,
which leaves a coverage gap.</p>

<p>There is one station within the city of Ann Arbor.
<a href="http://aprs.fi/info/a/KD8TDF">KD8TDF</a> is in southeast
Ann Arbor (EN82dg). Its coverage is enough to pick up
part of I-94 right adjacent to town. A second station,
<a href="http://aprs.fi/info/a/AB3DC-1">AB3DC-1</a> is the
Ann Arbor/Ypsi Rx-iGate, w8pgw.org, right near St.
Joe&rsquo;s Hospital (EN82eg).</p>

<p>Discussion at last night&rsquo;s ARROW meeting included a
desire to experiment on 2 meters with digital modes.
Dave New <a href="http://www.qrz.com/DB/N8SBE">N8SBE</a> talked
about software defined radio and GNU Radio, and demonstrated
monitoring car key-fobs on UHF.</p>

<p>APRS is a very old and useful digital mode, and I
am hopeful that local network conditions will improve.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor Building Board of Appeals will not meet today, January
13, 2016, for lack of a quorum.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know the following to help understand more about this group:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is on the board, and how long have they been on it?</li>
<li>Have there been any recent changes to board membership?</li>
<li>Who is eligible to be appointed to the board, and what does that process entail?</li>
<li>What happens to decisions that the board needs to make if a quorum cannot be met?</li>
<li>What is the status of the search for a full-time building official?</li>
<li>When does the board next anticipate meeting with a quorum?</li>
<li>Who has been nominated to serve on this board?</li>
<li>Why did the board not make quorum?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=452565&amp;GUID=F55A2A53-26AB-404B-9A59-8A9FCD92EE39&amp;Options=info&amp;Search=">agenda for the meeting</a> has been
posted, which gives you an idea of what is not being done:</p>

<ul>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 325 W Liberty</li>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 215 N Maple<br /></li>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 121 W Kingsley</li>
<li>BBA Show Cause Hearing for 2001 Commerce</li>
<li>BBA Show Cause Hearing for 111 S Main St</li>
</ul>

<p>The last of these, 111 S Main St, is a building on the city&rsquo;s
Dangerous Buildings list right on Main Street. The building
has a tree growing out of the roof, spongy floors due to water
infiltration, and mold everywhere according to the building
inspector&rsquo;s report. The unavailability of the Building Board
means that the owner of 111 S Main doesn&rsquo;t have to face a
public hearing for another month.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>January 8, 2016, 5:30 pm (Ann Arbor time): Central Michigan University
spokesman Steve Smith answered questions today by telephone regarding
a Morning Sun editorial, <a href="http://www.themorningsun.com/opinion/20160108/editorial-status-quo-cmu-mum-on-talk-of-shutting-tv-station">Status quo: CMU mum on talk of shutting TV station</a>, published in this Digital First Media newspaper
from Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.</p>

<p>In the lede, the newspaper writes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Central Michigan University considers whether or not to shut
down its Public Broadcasting television network, the silence is
deafening.  CMU trustees almost a month ago voted to consider
shutting WCMU-TV and its three sister stations in exchange for up
to $726 million from the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith poined out that the University had only approved to &ldquo;apply
for eligibility&rdquo;, which is not binding on CMU to proceed, and that
all options were open. In addition, he noted a Federal anti-collusion
rule that restricts the rights of potential auction participants
to speak freely about their intent leading up to the auction.</p>

<p>Central Michigan University invites public comment on its decisions
to sell part or all of its broadcast spectrum back to the FCC, in an
auction that is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. Address your
comments in email to trustees@cmich.edu or by postal mail to
106 Warriner Hall, Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant, MI 48859.
<a href="https://www.cmich.edu/bot/Pages/default.aspx">The next public meeting of the Trustees is on February 18, 2016</a>,
and with prior arrangement there is time for the public to provide
comment on agenda items.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Federal Communications Commission, which
manages this auction, was not available for comment at this time.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Hall, January 8, 2016 - A brief report from a jammed
Council committee meeting held in the council workroom. The committee
moved public comment time to the begining of the meeting to hear
concerns of citizens who objected to a previous decision of the committee,
memorialized as follows on Legistar as 15-1179 enacted on October 16, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resolution to Approve a Request from Aquamarine Springs, LLC for a New Micro-Brewer, Small Wine-Maker, Small Distiller Liquor License and Dance/Entertainment Permit, to be Located at 507 S. Ashley Street Sponsors: Council Liquor License Review Committee</p>

<p>The committee noted that the building is located in the floodway and is also part of the Old West Side Historic District. Committee members discussed the fact that any renovation to the building would require further review by the Fire and Building Departments and may also require site plan approval. It was noted that this approval was only for the applicant to proceed with the liquor license application process.</p>

<p>A motion was made by Councilmember Kailasapathy, seconded by Councilmember Lumm, that the Resolution be recommended for approval to the City Council on 10/19/2015. On a voice vote, the Chair declared the motion carried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizens at the meeting objected to this decision, both
that they were not properly informed of the decision making
at the time as well as the observation that there is a preschool
nearby that should have the right to object to the decision.
Several people at this meeting had gone to Lansing to register their
complaints.</p>

<p>Also on the docket was a proposal from Glass House Brewing LLC for
a &ldquo;New Micro-Brewer Liquor License to be Located at 2350 W. Liberty
Street&rdquo;.</p>

<p>More later as time and space warrants.</p>

<p>On Arborwiki: <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Aquamarine_Springs">Aquamarine Springs</a> and <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Glass_House_Brewing">Glass House Brewing</a>,

both readings from automated sensors (about £250) as well as
manual readings from gaugeboards or photos.</p>

<p>New as of December 2015 is an <a href="http://www.nominet.uk/iot-technology-powers-an-interactive-flood-map-and-sensor-network/">interactive flood map</a>.
A post from Nominet describes the effort:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nominet, in association with the Flood Network, is today launching an interactive, online map which visualises river and stream levels around Oxford. The map, showing how technology can be a part of flood defence systems anywhere, has been developed following a successful pilot project with the Oxford Flood Network. The project has been focused on exploring the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas for the first time in the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system is using TVWS (&ldquo;TV white space&rdquo;) as its wide area backhaul
network for these sensors for hard-to-reach devices that are outside
of the range of wifi. Cost-effective and reliable access to remote
small sensors is one of the tough spots in Internet of Things development,
it&rsquo;s interesting to see TVWS as a possible solution to this issue.
The other relevant technology for low-cost metro area networks for
sensors is Lorawan, more about which later.</p>

Greetings all,

Sincere apologies, but we are experiencing technical difficulties
with our inspection software and I am unable to retrieve the
restaurant inspection list for November. Kristen is currently on
vacation and will return on December 29th. I am hoping that she
will be able to remedy the issue and will be able to send along the

So sorry for any inconvenience!!

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, January 6, 2016. Columbia Journalism Review&rsquo;s
Anna Clark broke the news of cuts at MLive to journalist jobs there,
in this post on Twitter. Details to follow as I have them.
Reports, as of yet unconfirmed, suggest that MLive will shed
jobs statewide including at the Ann Arbor News.</p>

<p>MLive posted a <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2016/01/mlive_media_group_announces_ne.html">news release</a>, &ldquo;MLive Media Group announces news restructuring&rdquo;, which reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of staff members producing content – reporters, photographers and producers in video and social media – remains intact statewide, although some roles will evolve based on audience demands, Hiner said. Overall, 29 content positions will be eliminated, primarily through reducing management roles and jobs related to newspaper production, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Hiner, a former Bay City Times and Flint Journal editor, is
vice president of content at MLive.</p>

<p>Mark Maynard has commentary and some names of locals who are being
reassigned or laid off, in his post
<a href="http://markmaynard.com/2016/01/a-terrible-blow-to-journalism-mlive-cuts-29-jobs-at-a-time-when-michigan-desperately-needs-quality-reporting/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">A “terrible blow to journalism, ” MLive cuts 29 jobs at a time when Michigan desperately needs quality reporting</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it’s not yet official, as far as I know, word is that several of these 29 jobs eliminated across the company were in the Ann Arbor office. As I understand it, the two managing producers, Cindy Heflin and Julie Taylor, were both laid off, as was entertainment reporter Jenn McKee. And others have been reassigned to statewide positions. Paula Gardener, for instance, will be stepping away from her editorial duties to become a statewide business reporter. Likewise, I’m told that John Counts and Jessica Webster will also be shifting to the statewide team. As for editorial duties, it’s unclear to me what they’ll be doing without Gardener in that role, but I’m told a few new people will be coming into the organization, so perhaps one of them will be charged with such tasks. For instance, I hear that someone named Jen Eyer has been named the new “team leader,” which I’m hoping is something at least approximating an editor. [Without an editor, it might as well be a blog, right?]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A request for comment from MLive Media Group president Dan Gaydou
was not immediately acknowledged. (To be fair, he doesn&rsquo;t use Twitter
much, and it was my first DM to him.) Ann Arbor News editor
Paula Gardner also did not respond to a Twitter DM.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Michigan State University is considering placing the spectrum
that it uses for WKAR-TV into an auction that the FCC is running,
in which case it might receive upwards of $200 million in exchange
for ceasing all of its terrestrial broadcasts.</p>

<p>This strikes me as a penny wise, pound foolish approach. Once
the spectrum is gone you can&rsquo;t get it back, and as a land grant
institution should know it&rsquo;s important to be a good steward of
the resources you have been handed not just for the short term
but for the long term. Selling off a 50+ year tradition of
public broadcasting for a quick buck seems like a bad approach,
no matter how appealing a big check would be, especially
considering the community&rsquo;s investment in the station.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t currently have a TV receiver for over the air broadcasts,
but my neighbor down the street who does make the trek from Ann
Arbor to Lansing to give her thoughts. Her family grew up on WKAR-TV
and have been supporters for years, and they rely on over the
air television to bring in the signal.</p>

<p>More as I have it; I&rsquo;m collecting links and news articles at

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m trying to learn Morse Code, at least to be able to copy characters at a
a fast enough pace to understand what the IDs on the local 2 meter
amateur repeaters are saying. Over a previous holiday break I had
sorted out at least a little bit of sending Morse, so some letters
are already familiar (CQ, K, E, SOS). I don&rsquo;t yet know how to either
send or recognize my call sign. There&rsquo;s a ways to go.</p>

<p>Ward Cunningham K9OX has a <a href="http://c2.com/~ward/morse/">page full of ham radio software</a>, including a
<a href="http://c2.com/~ward/morse/morse.html">Morse Code Teaching Machine</a>
that does a nifty adaptive learning system to feed you the letters
you need work on. It dates from the article
<a href="http://c2.com/morse/wiki.cgi?QstArticle">A Fully Automatic Morse Code Teaching Machine, QST (May 1977)</a>.
Ward wrote it to fit on a very tiny machine, and it&rsquo;s been subsequently
ported and improved to run on bigger machines, but still at its heart
it&rsquo;s old and tiny (and in some essential way very wonderful).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the Macintosh version; there&rsquo;s an interesting
version for Ward&rsquo;s federated wiki as well, which would
be worth trying.</p>

      <p>As previously noted here I&rsquo;m fond of getting and sending postcards.
I&rsquo;m also a ham radio operator, which makes it reasonable to want
to get and send postcards as QSL cards.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a stockpile of preprinted cards, so my habit is to
recycle old postcards either from PTO Thrift ($0.10 each) or from
a local bookseller ($0.00 each), apply a postcard stamp, and hand
write the details. But I&rsquo;ve also successfully send cards using
the <a href="http://www.lob.com">lob.com service</a> and the thought is that
if I got my act together I could pretty easily put together a
QSL printer that would run off a command line and lob full-custom cards
into the mail at about $0.70 each postage paid.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have a QSL card template for lob.com. Some notes for

      </h3>
      <p>&ldquo;Learn this one weird trick&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&rdquo;</p>

<p>Really though it&rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&rsquo;s had a sale on kale for
99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and
when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it
from the wrong bin, whatever.</p>

<p>Get home, cook the kale (it&rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the
twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&rsquo;t
actually organic, and that I was overcharged.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the &ldquo;Lucky&rsquo;s overcharges&rdquo; before on our neighborhood
email list, where it comes up from time to time., I didn&rsquo;t
have to quote chapter and verse of state law, just mention the
Michigan scan law. The manager hand wrote a receipt and gave me
$5.00 cash as well as refunding the purchase price of the kale on
my card.</p>

<p>Fortunately I didn&rsquo;t have to buy any more kale. Chocolate ice cream
was $4.99 per half gallon, and it too was delicious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Save your receipts, at least until the meal is eaten.</li>
<li>Check the twist-ties on your produce to make sure you got what you were charged for.</li>
<li>Organic produce PLU numbers are 5 digits starting with a 9.</li>
<li>Lucky&rsquo;s was friendly when I pointed out their error, no hassle at all.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>Sauteed kale</p>

<ul>
<li>1 bunch kale (organic preferred)</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1 clove garlic</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the oil until it shimmers. Slice the garlic into slices and
cook until fragrant but not yet browned.</p>

<p>Wash the kale and trim the stems . Chop the leaves finely. Add to
hot pan and stir until the kale has wilted somewhat and has changed
color.</p>

<p>Add about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup of water to the pan, then cover quickly. Steam
the kale until cooked to taste.</p>

      </h3>

<p>I had a chance to spend some time at the U of Michigan
<a href="http://guides.lib.umich.edu/cvga">Computer and Video Game Archive</a>
tonight, with J in tow (or perhaps I was in tow).
We played for about two hours in total, and then adjourned
for dinner to talk about new and classic gaming and game emulation.
He snuck in a few games of Tetris on his phone afterwards.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few game reviews and observations.</p>

<p>The first game I turn to at the UMCVGA is an arcade version of
Centipede. The archive has an <a href="http://www.arcadelegends.com/">Arcade Legends</a>
cabinet that has real arcade controls, and then emulated games
running on some kind of Linux system running MAME inside.
&ldquo;Legendary arcade games authentic in every detail&rdquo; says the pitch,
and the game comes with the crucial trackball that makes the
arcade version of Centipede a singular experience.</p>

<p>As an Atari game, Centipede is also available on other systems, and
I looked at it on the Atari 2600, running on original hardware
including a vintage analog television set for the display. Centipede
is not very complex, and the 2600 version is faithful to the original
gameplay for the most part. The graphics are as flickery as I had
ever remembered, especially when you hit your target.</p>

<p>A reasonable life goal is to play Centipede on as many systems as
the Archive supports. The Mirlyn catalog currently suggests
that there are <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?type%5B%5D=all&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=centipede%20game&amp;filter%5B%5D=format%3AVideo%20Games">eight versions of Centipede</a> available, on platforms including
Sega Dreamcast,
the TI-99,
Atari 2600,
Sega Genesis,
Playstation Portable (PSP),
Windows 95 / 98,
Playstation, and
Windows XP.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing on the Nintendo 3DS was new to me, though I had
heard <a href="https://twitter.com/chairckicker">Brian Kerr</a> talk about it
for quite some time. Animal Crossing is really fun in a quirky little
way that a social casual game that&rsquo;s age-appropriate for seven year
olds can be. I didn&rsquo;t get very far into the game, but it was clear
that every character in the game that interacted with me was super
happy to see me back in the system, and that kind of welcoming
reunion greeting was something I want to emulate myself.</p>

<p>A recent (January 2015) interview with David Carter (superman) on PRX
was a good 17 minute listen about the current state of the archive.</p>

<p>On PRX: <a href="https://beta.prx.org/stories/141395">Six Years Inside the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive with David Carter</a> from Radio Free Culture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Carter of the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive at University of
Michigan tells us about the collection, how it&rsquo;s used in an academic
setting, and a little about the care and feeding of elderly video
game consoles.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question
of &ldquo;platform&rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer
IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes
in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt,
it&rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for
2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.</p>

<p>This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar
systems are next to each other. It&rsquo;s a highly dimensional space, but
all elements have something in common: engineers are trying to
change how we interact with simple devices like light bulbs through
our hand-held phones, and no one has the full correct answer that&rsquo;s
obviously right. Indeed it&rsquo;s not clear at all that there is
a right answer for some of these controls; the
<a href="http://twitter.com/internetofshit">Internet of Shit twitter account</a>
collects with some glee the number of devices that emphatically should
not be on the Internet.</p>

<p>On to the platforms:</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em> is hard to ignore. Many smaller cloud platforms are
built on top of its AWS computing platforms, and Amazon has
entered the fray with its AWS IoT service that offers a hosted
MQTT message server. In addition Amazon has the Echo product
that does voice recognition. Nearly impossible to ignore, Amazon
is a clear central player in the IoT consumer space.</p>

<p><em>Google</em> is a distant second in the IoT world, mostly because
the Google Compute Engine isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a compute
platform, and the Android phone isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a top
end phone. Google does have the moxie to make it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Internet Thing&rdquo;
be a self-driving car. The Nest thermostat is the most obvious
home point-of-entry for Google, and the platform and brand extension
to watch is more stuff that works with Nest.</p>

<p><em>Apple</em> has the phone to want, and the assistant (Siri) that people
have learned how to talk to to get things done. If the Internet of
Things is going to be controlled from an app, it&rsquo;s an app that&rsquo;s going
to run on an Apple phone, and you&rsquo;re going to be able to talk to it.
Less clear is Apple&rsquo;s in-home device hub strategy - the AppleTV never
really has had that open platform feel to attract the first-mover developer.</p>

<p><em>Microsoft</em> would dearly love to play in this world, but Windows 10
on ARM and the Raspberry Pi is a disappointment, and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is mostly
defined by problems too big for Excel. The Microsoft cloud platform,
Azure, mostly seems to be used by organizations that treat it as
a second or third data center, or who are locked in to Azure for
business and partnership reasons. Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana is capable, but
hardly anyone has Windows phones to talk with.</p>

<p><em>IBM</em> is the wild card here. Their Bluemix hosted platform service is
interesting if unusual and not really aimed at the consumer space. A
very interesting Node-RED project has extended IBM influence into
the Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth BLE sensor space, but it feels like
an interesting technology play and not a product.</p>

<p>Next, to major players with hardware. &ldquo;How many engineers does it
take to change a lightbulb?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Philips</em> has the Hue line of home products, mostly lighting focused.
There was a hue and cry about the Philips decision to disable support
for some compatible products that did not have explicit partnership
agreements in place, and the nature of the complaining made it clear
that there&rsquo;s an active hobbyist community around this product space.</p>

<p><em>Flex</em> is the new player, with its recent acquisition of the
assets of Wink from the bankruptcy of Quirky.  Flex, formerly known
as Flextronics, is a large contract manufacturer, and it knows how
to build quite a few things; look for Wink&rsquo;s technology to make its
way into a wider range of products.</p>

<p><em>Samsung</em> and their SmartThings brand has enough market share to make
interesting efforts, but again to that point there&rsquo;s no one breakout
product in their portfolio that brings that brand much to mind unless
you are using it.</p>

<p>Finally -</p>

<p>The biggest winner in the IoT space for this year and probably for
next year is an Internet tool with the unlikely name of <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
&ldquo;If this, then that&rdquo; is the level of control you get with IFTTT,
and surprisingly enough that&rsquo;s enough to do all sorts of things -
mostly because IFTTT speaks just enough of the protocols of over 100
systems that you can glue together a recipe that does something
when something else happens even when the two vendors you are dealing
with have never heard of each other.</p>

<p>Interoperability is the bugaboo of Internet of Things systems development.
Many vendors want you to sign up to their big bear hug of a partnership
agreement and work solely within their ecosystem. Others have narrow
APIs and proprietary protocols that discourage casual reuse. Where
IFTTT fits in is as a universal connector kit that lets you explore
how parts fit together.  The IFTTT
<a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/collections/32-recipes-for-the-internet-of-things">recipes for the Internet of Things</a> captures some of the essence of what
can be done right now without much of a fuss if you have wide protocol
support, even if it&rsquo;s only very simple support.
Many vendors in the &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;
space could benefit from thorough understanding of simple connectivity.</p>

<p>Also previously: <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/">Split tunnels considered harmful</a></p>

<p>I have this running in a staging environment and a test
environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying
operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing
rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that
it runs on a single host &amp; thus provides neither
high availability in the case of Amazon <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-20-aws-dynamodb-downtime-sunday-am/">funkiness</a>
nor scalability to handle lots of clients.</p>

<p>Getting this to be more reliable was a matter of tracking
down the right systemd configuration. I&rsquo;ll save systemd
commentary for a separate post, saying only that it&rsquo;s new,
it&rsquo;s not necessarily better for managing single machines,
but I can see the advantages for consolidated management of
big collections of machines.</p>

<p>Some OpenVPN config alternatives to pursue that look like they might do
the right thing are as follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cloudcoreo.com">CloudCoreo</a> has a setup based on the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.
They say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting an OpenVPN config up and running in AWS is difficult. We&rsquo;ve already done it for you in an HA, durable, self-healing way. This blog post details how.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blog post is in two sections.
<a href="http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn/">Part one</a> details how they
configured autoscaling, elastic load balancing, name service, S3
storage and policies, and security and IAM policies to set things
up the way that you would want them within Amazon&rsquo;s AWS.
<a href="http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn-part-2-of-2/">Part two</a> goes on to describe the particular OpenVPN policy
and routing setup, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of policy there particularly
with the use of split tunnels that you want to understand.</p>

<p>Their claim that they have
&ldquo;done it all for you&rdquo; reflects a <a href="http://hub.cloudcoreo.com/stack/servers-vpn_c6a65">complete configuration</a> available
through their CloudCoreo system.</p>

<p>A second approach is detailed by <a href="https://blog.zalando.com">Zalando</a>, a Berlin based retail fashion platform.
Their article <a href="https://tech.zalando.com/blog/building-an-openvpn-cluster-zalando-style/">Building an OpenVPN Cluster, Zalando-Style</a>
uses dynamic routing to distribute routes, and the
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/">Quagga</a> system as their software based router. This setup
does not particularly depend on AWS features, and they
claim that
&ldquo;With this set up, we have about 800 users (150 in parallel) and haven’t faced any performance issues at anytime, from anywhere!&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s a bit more complex to set up, though the writeup
makes it clear that because of the flexibility that dynamic
routing gives you there&rsquo;s the opportunity to construct
firewall policies that follow the user quite independent
of how they are connecting to the network.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. (John Gall, Systemantics)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich.
That&rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies,
even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative
of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.</p>

<p>Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need
only point you at the <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/main.html">Usenet Cookbook</a>,
developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.
&ldquo;I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I would have feared.&rdquo; But that collection is
weak on sandwiches, lending itself more to
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/us/SP-menu.html">soups</a>.</p>

<p>To remedy this need I have started a small and pitiful but
hopefully growable sandwich recipe collection, using Github
as the hosting place of choice. See
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich">the vielmetti/sandwich repository</a>
for the first start. As it happens, I am clearly not the only person
to think this way; herewith some collection of sandwich collections.</p>

<p>Barrie Turner (@bazbt3) came up with roughly the same idea at the same
time, and you might see his <a href="http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2015/12/10/git-sandwiches/">git sandwiches</a> blog for the proper inspiration for collection
development. Thanks to @ellemef for connecting us.</p>

<p>Single sandwiches in git include</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnus919/grilledcheese">grilled cheese</a>, from Magnus Hedemark</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pcon/recipes/tree/master/meals/fried_chicken_sandwich">gluten free fried chicken sandwich</a> from Patrick Connelly</li>
</ul>

<p>and certainly many more.</p>

<p>If you are ill-equipped in your kitchen
to make your own sandwiches, this command line tool will
<a href="https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js">order you a sandwich from Jimmy John&rsquo;s</a>. It comes with a makefile so that you invoke it as
<code>sudo make me a sandwich</code> and it will do the right thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year.</p>

<p>It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings
is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing
&ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them.</p>

<p>Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and
paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!)</p>

<p>Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile.
The topic of the conversation was roughly &ldquo;places to take a walk
outside in the winter&rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include
&ldquo;with a dog&rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get
onto Arborwiki.</p>

<p>As always the Arborwiki <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals">birthday deals</a>
page came through, and I scored freebies or discounts at
Northside Grill (breakfast sandwich), Roos Roast (mocha),
Zingerman&rsquo;s Bakery (bread) and Zingerman&rsquo;s Coffee (coffee).</p>

<p>The technical commentary of the year is that Twitter has an
opportunity to step up its birthday game, and it would seem
that that&rsquo;s a chance to do things right (or do things differently
from Facebook, at least).</p>

<p>Until the next time around the sun!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes
through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor
routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&rsquo;ve
had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes.</p>

<p>As it happens, there&rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the
Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide. Here&rsquo;s a recent request
that gave me same-day results:</p>

<pre><code>Hello, this is a request under the Michigan Open Meetings Act.

Please make available for inspection the draft minutes of the (named)
Committee meeting of today, December 8, 2015.

Under the terms of the Act, draft minutes are to be made available
for inspection within 8 business days of the date of the meeting,
or by my calendar December 18, 2015.

(Name) is listed as the staff contact for this board.

Thank you for your cooperation.
</code></pre>

<p>The request was routed to the staff member, and the minutes were prepared
and ready and shared with me the same day that the meeting was held.
Same day service!</p>
