      </h3>
      <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://crisislanding.appspot.com/" target="_self">2011 hurricane season crisis map from Google</a>&#0160;has the first large scale version of a multi-utility outage map. It renders thematic maps from 5 east coast utilities (ConEdison, Pepco, Progress Energy, Delmarva and Atlantic City) on a single map, pulled from a KML (GeoRSS) file that notes the relative severity of the storms in each area. Map below shows a day with no severe outages, all blue; I&#39;ll need to compare with a post-storm power outage.</p>

<h3>DETROIT, Sept. 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy has introduced a new interactive iPhone application (app) for customers to access a variety of up-to-the-minute information, including real-time outage information from their mobile devices.</h3>
<p>The DTE Energy Outage Center app is available from the Apple iTunes App store or Apple.com free of charge.</p>
<p>Located at&#0160;<a href="http://dteenergy.com/" target="_blank">dteenergy.com</a>, the Outage Center is a central area online where consumers interested in getting the latest information about power outages, get tips on what to do during a storm or other frequently asked questions. DTE Energy is one of the first utilities in the country to allow customers to report power outages via a downloadable native mobile smartphone application. &#0160;</p>
<p>Using the app, DTE Energy customers can report power outages, view the status of a reported problem and explore a map illustrating the number of outages reported throughout the area.</p>
<p>DTE Energy has added this mobile capability to our existing suite of outage-related offerings to bring useful information to customers in the way they want or in an outage situation, where they are able to see it.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a variety of tools for our customers already available on the DTE Energy website and we want to extend those tools in new and engaging ways,&quot; said Patrick Duffy, Customer Service Manager with DTE Energy. With the summer storm season upon us, extending the outage reporting tools to the iPhone was a great place for us to start.&quot;</p>
<p>Additional mobile communications offerings, such as the ability to check account balances and submit mobile payments are currently in development. DTE Energy is also working on an application that supports Android devices.</p>
<p>DTE Energy expects the iPhone app to give users a convenient method to report problems and retrieve updates. The company worked with Southfield-based RIIS to develop and test the application, which allows customers to access information on outages in their neighborhood or throughout Michigan.</p>
<p>The creation of an iPhone app broadens the reach of DTE Energy&#39;s Outage Center tools to a wider audience.</p>
<p>DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Its operating units include Detroit Edison, an electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan, MichCon, a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan and other non-utility, energy businesses focused on gas storage and pipelines, unconventional gas production, power and industrial projects, and energy trading.

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at201109.html" target="_self">Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene</a> page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-pi"><img alt="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov" target="_self">National Hurricane Center&#39;</a>s Irene archive has a fascinating <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/graphics/al09/loop_5W.shtml" target="_self">loop of 5 day Hurricane Irene forecasts</a>, showing the evolving best forecast track for the storm. It&#39;s a clear look not only at where the storm is going but also where projections have changed, in this case the projections that (on Tuesday) have landfall in North Carolina instead of Florida.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/" target="_self">Tropical Cyclone Guidance Project at NCAR</a>&#0160;has an even more detailed set of <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/realtime/plots/northatlantic/2011/al092011/" target="_self">data for Hurricane Irene</a>, including an archive of sets of model predictions for the storm.</p>
<p>After the storm, the set of models will be compared to the actual path to verify model accuracy. This National Weather Service <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/index.shtml" target="_self">National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification</a>&#0160;report charts forecast accuracy over time, noting how improved modeling and added computing power has made storm forecasting more accurate over time. How much better? Consider that the average 24 hour forecast error was 100 miles in 1990, but only 50 miles in 2010; also, that the models currently in use give as good a 5 day forecast (about 225 miles off) as the 2 day forecast was in 1988.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-17-what-to-write/">What to write</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next.</p>
<p>Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that. A second is the perennially interesting article which routinely gets seasonal traffic when the world looks for that bit of information that they look for every year.</p>
<p>A third type of post, of course, is this one, which gets no appreciable readership in the short run or in the long run; that&#39;s mostly typical.</p>
<p>Writing the perennially interesting piece is hard, because you need to care about something deeply enough to capture a piece of what you and the world know about it that&#39;s of enduring interest and that&#39;s enough better than the rest of the net that people will find it. Once you do track this down, your search logs will lead you to variations and refinements that make the post better. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage maps</a> post has this quality.</p>
<p>The post with a burst of intense newsworthiness is generally not newsworthy beyond two or three days. If you are fortunate, you have collected something that is otherwise interesting. I have a habit of collecting incident and situation maps for emerging events; this recent <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/august-2011-london-riot-maps.html" target="_self">London riot map</a> post is of that type.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to think that I don&#39;t need to have an audience (beyond myself) for this writing, but that said, it&#39;s always good to see that at least someone reads something that you write. (Otherwise, you&#39;d be better off putting in on paper and then recycling it immediately.) When I&#39;ve tried to use a blog as mostly a collection point, it has helped to divide out a separate blog for that purpose. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/telegraph" target="_self">telegraphy blog</a> admits the notion that on any given day zero or one person might read it, but it has been assembled as a collection, not a narrative. For some other ongoing efforts, a wiki might be more appropriate, e.g. for <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor history</a>, <a href="http://camera-wiki.org" target="_self">cameras</a>, or encyclopedic knowledge about <a href="http://t.tatianastomatobase.com:88/wiki/Main_Page" target="_self">tomatoes</a>. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A trip to the Goodwill store in Marquete, MI prompted an examination of their media collection. I ignored the piles of CDs, skipped the shelf of LPs, and went to the bin that had cassettes and 8-tracks. For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;. On the video shelves, there were plenty of 1990s vintage VHS tapes and a whole shelf of VHS players stacked up.</p>
<p>This is the same store that had a 1973 Reader&#39;s Digest Almanac on the shelf, reporting earnestly on the issues of the day (Nixon, food prices).</p>
<p>The 8-track discovery led me to do some searching, and I found a whole collection of <a href="http://www.fwweekly.com/index.php?option=com_wordpress&amp;tag=the-dead-media&amp;Itemid=12" target="_self">stories in the Fort Worth Weekly about The Dead Media</a>, an 8-track record label with a handful of new releases. &#0160;See <a href="http://deadmediatapes.com/" target="_self">DeadMediaTapes.com</a>&#0160;for the work of&#0160;Fort Worth R&amp;B singer-songwriter&#0160;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/browningham" target="_blank">Nathan Brown</a>.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how long these 8-tracks have been rattling around, and what path they took to get to this particular Goodwill. &#0160;They had the dusty patina of unloved old media, still recognizably worth something, but not yet at a home that would appreciate them. &#0160; They aren&#39;t hip, or trendy, or ironic; they&#39;re just old, at least in this place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acturban.org/biennial/doc_planners/treanor_internet_hyperliberalism.htm" target="_self">The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism</a>&#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. On the contrary: never before in history, have so many separate networks been technically possible. Linking all networks together is a conscious choice by some people, a choice then imposed on others. The logic is identical to that of colonial governments, which forced peasants into the agricultural market, by imposing cash taxes. (To pay the tax, the peasants had to sell cash crops such as sugar). This logic says in effect: &#39;no one is free to stay outside the free market&#39;. Today, not just governments, but business, social movements, intellectuals and artists, all want to impose the Net. This broad movement is obviously more than profit-seeking (and a non-profit Net would also be wrong). It is an ideological movement seeking ideological imposition. That imposition itself, the universalism, the expansionism, their involuntary nature, the basic unfreedom to exit - that is what makes liberal structures wrong. That applies to the free market, and it applies inherently to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=2299" target="_self">Pandora&#39;s Vox Redux</a> (humdog, 1994)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many times in cyberspace, i felt it necessary to say that i was human. once, i was told that i existed primarily as a voice in somebody’s head. lots of times, i need to see handwriting on paper or a photograph or a phone conversation to confirm the humanity of the voice, but that is the way that i am. i resist being boxed and inventoried and i guess i take william gibson seriously when he writes about machine intelligence and constructs. i do not like it. i suspect that my words have been extracted and that when this essay shows up, they will be extracted some more. when i left cyberspace, i left early one morning and forgot to take out the trash. two friends called me on the phone afterwards and said, hummie your directory is still there. and i said OH. and they knew and i knew, that it was possible that people had been entertaining themselves with the contents of my directories. the amusement never ends, as peter gabriel wrote. maybe sometime i will rant again if something interesting comes up. in the meantime, give my love to the FBI.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who’d prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where–in the holy names of Education and Progress–important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mid-1990s were a good time to be high-mindedly anti-network.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly declares: &quot;The validity of the public debt of the&#0160;<strong>United&#0160;</strong><strong>States</strong>, authorized by law, . . . shall not be questioned.&quot; While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the Government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation. We regard it as confirmatory of a fundamental principle, which applies as well to the government bonds in question, and to others duly authorized by the Congress, as to those issued before the Amendment was adopted.

      <p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 18, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --</p>
<p>Borders Group reported today that, in accordance with the terms of its financing agreement, the Company will submit to the Court for approval the previously-announced proposal from&#0160;Hilco and Gordon Brothers&#0160;to purchase the store assets of the business and administer the liquidation process. Borders said that, in the absence of a formal proposal from a going concern bidder, it did not require an auction prior to presenting the proposal to the Court at a scheduled hearing on&#0160;Thursday, July 21, 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the best efforts of all parties, we are saddened by this development,&quot; said Borders Group President&#0160;Mike Edwards. &quot;We were all working hard towards a different outcome, but the headwinds we have been facing for quite some time, including the rapidly changing book industry, eReader revolution, and turbulent economy, have brought us to where we are now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For decades, Borders stores have been destinations within our communities, places where people have sought knowledge, entertainment, and enlightenment and connected with others who share their passion. Everyone at Borders has helped millions of people discover new books, music, and movies, and we all take pride in the role Borders has played in our customers&#39; lives,&quot; Edwards continued, &quot;I extend a heartfelt thanks to all of our dedicated employees and our loyal customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Borders currently operates 399 stores and employs approximately 10,700 employees. Subject to the Court&#39;s approval, under the proposal, liquidation is expected to commence for some stores and facilities as soon as&#0160;Friday, July 22, with a phased rollout of the program which is expected to conclude by the end of September. Borders intends to liquidate under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, as a result, Borders expects to be able to pay vendors in the ordinary course for all expenses incurred during the bankruptcy cases.</p>

      <p>Thanks to a a promo code I had a chance to look at <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/hello-america/" target="_self">Spotify</a>. Some first impressions.</p>
<p>The service looks like an iTunes which you can play any song that you can find, for free. I haven&#39;t probed the catalog to see how deep it is, but the Beatles and Bob Dylan are represented by cover bands, not the originals. It&#39;s shiny, and the music plays instantly when you click on a song.</p>
<p>1. It doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Napster; perhaps nothing ever will, again. Part of the joy of Napster was the thrill of the chase, knowing that every time you searched it it would be a little different, and that every possible obscure track might be online some day so if it wasn&#39;t there you just wanted to come back the next day.</p>
<p>2. I can&#39;t reconstruct the playlist for all of the tracks on the mix CD in my car, so for some definition of &quot;completeness&quot;, it isn&#39;t complete. That may say more about my tastes in music than anything else. I suppose that anyone who favors Da Yoopers and Barcelona is going to have problems with any service conceived in this decade.</p>
<p>3. Coca-Cola ads everywhere, plus splashy art for artists I don&#39;t know anything about. I suppose that&#39;s a plausible monetization strategy, but it&#39;s distracting.</p>
<p>4. After playing 5 or 6 tracks it put up an advertisement for an 80s playlist, which means that either it&#39;s profiling my interests from the songs I play, or it&#39;s otherwise assuming that how old I am specifies my musical tastes relatively completely.</p>
<p>Looks like a great service, but I&#39;m clearly not the target demographic.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
<div>MARQUETTE – Faye M. Amo, age 57, of 425 West Ridge Street, Marquette, entered eternal life Wednesday evening, July 13, 2011, at her home in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula Home Health and Hospice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Born March 23, 1954 in Lima, Ohio, a daughter of Stephen J. and Ethel (Salidas) Catel, Faye was raised in Ishpeming and graduated from the Ishpeming High School as salutatorian of her class. From her days in grade school, Faye held the desire to become a teacher. She enrolled at Northern Michigan University, where she received her baccalaureate degree summa cum laude (with highest honor) with a double major in French and English. She continued at Northern, obtaining a double masters degree in English and French in 1977 and later studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris where she earned highest honors in French.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Faye’s lifelong dream of becoming a teacher began with her first teaching assignment at the Ishpeming High School in 1977. In 1979, she started teaching French at the Marquette Senior High School, a career that would span 31 years. Teaching French was her passion in life and she loved all her students and they loved her. Affectionately known as Madame Amo, she was the consummate professional teacher, one who truly cared about her students and was dedicated to their education and well-being.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was not enough that the students learned the French language, she felt they needed to experience what “French” meant. Heading the French Club at Marquette Senior High School, Faye planned numerous trips for club members to big city museums to view French art exhibits, eat at French eateries, and learn about French culture. Over the years, several trips were taken to Chicago and to France in her mission to educate. These memorable events were always anticipated by Faye and greeted with enthusiasm by her students. For a number of years, she served as class advisor, particularly enjoying building and decorating floats for homecoming and decorating the gym for junior prom activities. Throughout her life, Faye maintained an untiring interest in the students at MSHS, often asking parents about their children, even through the children may never have been her students and she kept in regular contact with students who were now living adult lives, with families of their own.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to her affiliations at MSHS as foreign language department head for several years, class advisor for the MSHS graduating class of 2008, and serving on numerous parent-teacher committees, Faye was also a member of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption and the Ladies Philoptochos Society, and active in civic committees such as the American Association of University Women and the Marquette Beautification Committee. In her leisure, Faye loved walking her dog, Mario, for the 13 years of his life, bicycling, running – even participating in marathons in Detroit and France, and riding in her boat on beautiful Lake Superior.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Faye is survived by her husband, John; her cherished son, Bret; two sisters, Stephanie (Bob) Trumm and Jayme (Rick) Iknoiah both of California; her mother-in-law, Leone Amo of Ironwood; brothers-in-law, Tom Amo of Philadelphia, PA, Jim (Brooke) Amo of Livonia, and Ken Amo of Ft Worth, TX; and several nieces and nephews. Faye was preceded in death by her father, the honorable judge, Stephen J. Catel, her mother, Ethel Catel; brother-in-law, Andrew Walton; and father-in-law, John M. Amo.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The family will receive friends at the Swanson-Lundquist Funeral Home on Sunday from 4:00 pm until 7:00 pm. Trisagion will be held at 6:00 pm. The Funeral Liturgy will be held on Monday, July 18, at 11:00 am at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption with Rev. Tom Michalos officiating. Burial will be made in the Park Cemetery. Pallbearers will be Jimmy Pedakis, Lou Roumanis, Paul Andronis, Paul Wainio, Gary Shaffer, and Craig Cox. Memorials may be directed to the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption, 235 W. Ridge Street, Marquette, MI 49855 or to the Faye Amo Scholarship Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 101 W. Washington Street, Marquette, MI 49855. Condolences may be expressed online at www.swansonlundquistfuneralhome.com Adieu Madame Amo. Repose en paix.</div>

      <p>Google+ is to Twitter as Usenet is to IRC. Discuss.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m writing this down just so I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore; I don&#39;t know what Facebook is in this context.)</p>
<p>To elaborate: Google+ is like Usenet, except with no newsgroups, and most of the control over what you read being done through kill files and keep files. It&#39;s so busy that you can never catch up, and the default group is a combination of rec.pets.cats, talk.bizarre, and news.announce.newusers.</p>
<p>Twitter is like IRC, except that you&#39;re all on one channel. The hashtag syntax creates things similar to channels, which makes the whole mess easier to keep up with as long as your interests can be narrowed.&#0160;</p>
<p>In both cases, the inversion from the original system is that the fundamental unit of following is no longer the topic, it&#39;s the person. If your favorite Dr. Who fan also publishes lots of photos of their cats, you have to read them both together. There&#39;s no way on Google+ to carve out a narrow channel for deep discussion, not yet at least - you would expect that is the natural evolution, just as Twitter added support for emergent hash tags after they had been invented.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The ability (and the need) to edit other people&#39;s words is a sign of power over them, especially when it can be done without leaving a trace.&#0160;</p>
<p>The WELL, one of the ur-communities online, has this bold fundamental statement of literary authority:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.well.com/yoyow.html" target="_self">You own your own words.</a> This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on the WELL and that reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside of the WELL&#39;s conferencing system may be challenged by you, the author.</strong></blockquote>
<div>Every other online system I&#39;ve ever seen has something much weaker than this. The typical contribution to most networked writing places grants an unlimited license to reuse the work, with this one no worse than most:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.politonomist.com/important-notices/" target="_self">By posting a comment on Politonomist.com</a>, you grant Politonomist and it’s subsidiaries an indefinite and unlimited license to reproduce, edit and make use of the comment in any non-slanderous method seen fit.</blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<p>At least they said &quot;non-slanderous&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons that I continue to write on my own weblog as opposed to transferring my digital identity to some other system is that I have edit rights on all of the content and all of the discontent here. If someone publishes a comment, I have the ability to modify, delete, and quote from it. I&#39;m not certain that I&#39;ve asserted any specific moral rights to do this, but practically the &quot;edit&quot; button is all you need.</p>
<p>Oh, to be writing in a place where word ownership was unambiguous.</p>

      <p>A fascinating account of how Zappo&#39;s improved the quality of reviews on its site by hiring Mechanical Turkers to correct spelling and grammar. From <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/04/want-to-improve-sales-fix-grammar-and.html" target="_self">Behind the Enemy Lines</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An online retailer noticed that, indeed, products with high-quality reviews are selling well. So, they decided to take action. The retailer used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of the reviews posted on its own website. Using the&#0160;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/soylent.pdf">Find-Fix-Verify pattern</a>, the retailed used Mechanical Turk to examine&#0160;<strong><em>millions&#0160;</em></strong>of product reviews. (Here are the archived versions of the HITs:&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/79f44798e8c296e29bddbd3a3aa8f60a/">Find</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/160L5FUZB7DDN03NIAB2D4J8HRZ022/">Fix</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/1QPDXYWLI7K28IZ6MAP7WEO0N6V03B/">Verify</a>. And if you have not figured out the firm name by now, the retailer is Zappos.) For the reviews with mistakes,<strong><em>they fixed the spelling and grammar errors! Thus they effectively improved the quality of the reviews on their website. And, correspondingly, they improved the demand for their products.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The estimated copy editing cost is $0.10 per review. Imagine how many other paragraph-sized chunks of text could be improved for a dime a piece, this post included.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I can't help myself to think of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle when considering the new Google+ system and how it organizes people into circles. The circle, properly constructed, is a "karass", the people who you are following around and around. The pivot of the karass is a "wampeter", the thing which draws you together - "a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail".</p>
<p>I go back to Seb Paquet's <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/2002/10/09.html#a426" target="_self">essay on ridiculously easy group formation</a>&nbsp;as a sense for how the Internet used to be if you wanted to start a collective enterprise. Most of the tasks at that time were relatively heavyweight, in that you had to begin something and set up the software infrastructure before you started to use it. Now, with most social networks, group formation is as easy as settling on a name for what you are doing, making that name prominent within your communications (e.g. using it as a hash tag), and then just doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at Google+ for pivots, you find people, but not ideas. Energy clusters around individual activity, and though it's possible to nominally describe a circle of people as being interested in football or ice hockey, you can't guarantee that those people will reciprocate by only writing about football or ice hockey. One thing you do all have in common, though is Google+ - and thus the wampeter that draws you all in is the system itself.</p>
<p>Following Vonnegut again there are two wampeters for each karass, one waxing, one waning. Fortunately we do have the other one named here already; an animal. Specifically a cat.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of the fun of <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_self">Google+</a>&#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &quot;circles&quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&#39;s private groups). It&#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard.</p>
<p>If Google knew who I went to high school with, it would be inviting me to make a &quot;high school friends&quot; circle, and it would be planning a reunion. But it&#39;s Facebook where that activity is going on, and Facebook where that particular circle of friends and former friends lives. It lives there not because I carefully and laboriously put it there but because Facebook has a group structure (however imperfect) that allows for shared group building, shared tagging of photos, shared lots of things.<br /><br />On Google+ I have no visibility into what other people&#39;s groupings for me are. If you think about just that, it&#39;s remarkable - no one would add me to a mailing list and start sending me things without me knowing it, and no one adds me to a named Facebook community or even a Twitter list without that being at least nominally visible. Yet only Google knows what other people categorize me as, and as more random names show up in my &quot;you were just added to a circle by...&quot; list, the more that particular information asymmetry seems to be visible.</p>
<p>It has been wearying to try to make sense of circles. If you engage in the system, you are expected to classify and categorize all of your correspondents into some kind of bucket that describes them. Alas, real people are many faceted, and don&#39;t fit into any single oversimplified category or stay narrowly focused on one topic. More to the point, I can&#39;t stay on topic myself unless I have a separate place narrowly defined where I&#39;m exploring a topic rather than just vacuuming up something interesting.</p>
<p>Google+ circles have cut into my sleep, and that&#39;s why you see circles under my eyes. I&#39;m better off resting up and spending the time creating things rather than figuring out which tiny bucket to sort them into.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.</p>
<p>In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in. They may have more context of the local situation, more access to people in positions of leadership, or more ability to get someone on the street to see something interesting, but they are not there first on the scene with exclusive coverage.</p>
<p>Last night, over ten thousand people listened in live and in real time as a hostage situation in Grand Rapids, Michigan came to a violent end over the police scanner. Everyone listening heard it first hand, before the news media had a chance to interpret it for them.</p>
<p>The best account of listening to the scanner is Mark W. Smith&#39;s Detroit Free Press piece, &quot;<a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110708/NEWS06/110708030/Mark-W-Smith-Online-police-scanner-an-eerie-window-into-gunman-s-standoff" target="_self">Online police scanner an eerie window into gunman&#39;s standoff</a>&quot;, which paints a vivid picture of what it was like to be in a newsroom listening to scanner traffic from hundreds of miles away. In contrast, Nathan Bomey&#39;s piece &quot;<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/grand-rapids-murders-terrorize-but-jennifer-granholm-tweeting-about-her-new-chevy-volt/" target="_self">Grand Rapids murders terrorize, but Jennifer Granholm tweeting about her new Chevy Volt</a>&quot; is noteworthy primarily for not sounding like it was written with the scanner going in the background - because if you were paying attention to what was happening in Grand Rapids while it was happening, you&#39;d never even have noticed that some people weren&#39;t yet tuned in yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-recyclebank/">Recyclebank Ann Arbor reports released; coupon redemption rates are low, but people recycle anyway</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the City of Ann Arbor has released reports showing the participation rate of Ann Arbor households in the <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/" target="_self">Recyclebank</a> program, which rewards citizens for putting out their recycling. The reports were provided in graphical format, so all numbers here are approximated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20May%202011%20Report.pdf" target="_self">summary report of program performance</a> provided in response to the request shows that about 40% of eligible citizens (about 9500 of 24000) have signed up for the program. These citizens accumulate points which can be exchanged for coupons that offer discounts to participating merchants. In the most recent month reported, May 2011, citizens earned about 1.5 million points and cashed in about 10% of them, resulting in about 1600 rewards ordered.</p>
<p>The Recyclebank contract costs the City of Ann Arbor about $200,000 per year. At current reward redemption rates, citizens will cash in on the order of 20,000 reward coupons, or less than one per eligible household, at an estimated program cost of approximately $10 per delivered coupon. This number could be $15 per coupon at the low monthly participation rate, and $7 per coupon at the high monthly rate; participation varies with the seasons, and a complete year of data is not yet in.</p>
<p>The reports provided do not address the question of whether rewards are increasing participation in the recycling program. If it did, this <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20Route%20by%20Route%20Report%20May%202011.pdf" target="_self">detail report showing recycling rates per route</a> would also include a Recyclebank participation rate per route, and you&#39;d be able to see at a glance whether routes with a high degree of Recyclebank participation correlate with increased recycling performance.</p>
<p>Are incentives driving increased recycling use? The reports provided do not make a compelling case. Redemption rates are so low that most people don&#39;t appear to bother cashing in their rewards. Even with this low redemption rate, almost 90% of people put their recycle cart out at least once a month, suggesting that people in Ann Arbor are already recycling at a high rate independent of external rewards.</p>

      <p>In summary, the train will be late, and it will be later than you had previously expected it to be late because of delays on the line due to the track owner (Norfolk Southern) restricting the speed of the track user (Amtrak). &#0160;See <a href="http://amtrakdelays.onlineschedulingsoftware.com/" target="_self">Amtrak Train Status History</a> for details.</p>

<p>Mulberries are out in full force on the trees and on the sidewalks. Look down for black blotches, then look up for ripe berries.</p>
<p>Blackberries and black raspberries can be found in parks or in the yards of helpful neighbors.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://wasemfruitfarm.com/" target="_self">Wasem&#39;s</a> has&#0160;U-pick&#0160;red and green gooseberries, red and black currants, and tart (sour) cherries, starting July 7. Not everything is always available depending on ripening, call ahead for details.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was away from my computer for a few days, but still near my Blackberry - a not-so-smart smartphone with a rudimentary web browser that is reminiscent of the finer parts of web browsing circa 1995. It&#39;s even better than 1995 in that the browser is so portable that it can go with you everywhere, and thus can be reasonably expected to be a mobile companion on social network outings.</p>
<p>Twitter is completely usable on this device, and the brief updates that people provide are ideal. The mobile Twitter web interface doesn&#39;t do a lot to support lists, but searches work great, and it&#39;s easily possible to follow along with what is going on and participate. It&#39;s an excellent companion in the car, especially when you&#39;re not driving. (Don&#39;t text and drive.)</p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s mobile web interface is rudimentary, but it does have access to almost all of the parts of the system that might make a difference. My phone is not smart enough to let me upload a photo directly into Facebook, but it did allow me to drop in a pleasantry or two, enough to satisfy the minimum social obligation.</p>
<p>Gmail on this device is slow, but fully functional. I wasn&#39;t able to keep up with my inbox, but it wasn&#39;t like I was really trying to, and it was incredibly handy to be able to search my email archives when I needed to.</p>
<p>Google+ is new, and it used to have support for my miserable browser when it launched; but that disappeared soon after launch. I was unattached to G+ throughout its holiday launch weekend.</p>
<p>I am sure that if I had a more capable device, my preferences would be more towards the fancier, newer systems with richer user interfaces and more shiny attractive access. That said, I don&#39;t know if more access is actually better when I&#39;m on the move. All three systems accumulate a social debt that has to be repaid in some way, in that mentions should be reciprocated, messages should be returned, and plans should be acknowledged. Unless you&#39;re willing to be transmit-only when you&#39;re on the move, none of the systems had enough bandwidth on my slightly-smart phone to really keep up with accumulated social network debris.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I have just now gotten access to Google+, so this review is a reflection of other reviews, some personal experience, and a weary view of novelty.</p>
<p>Google+ is out in very limited test. Some small number of well connected people now have access to a new piece of social software from Google, and initial reviews have been generally positive.</p>
<p>How do you assess whether the initial reviews of a system designed for communications are accurate for when the system eventually gets rolled out to a wider audience? Consider that the first people into the system were hand picked, that they generally like getting access to new systems, and that they are relatively experienced and gregarious online experts. Certainly they will like something new that only they have access to - quite independent of the set of features - because it gives them a chance to reconnect to old online friends and make some new ones.</p>
<p>When a communications system becomes available to the general public, the system dynamics change greatly. The initial group of participants can all be presumed to be interesting to each other, so talking to any random individual is likely to be someone relatively near you in social circumstance. As the population explodes, the random person gets less and less interesting, to the limit of when the random person is likely to be a spammer.</p>
<p>Google+ is at the invention stage. Much like Facebook seeded its early use poll with Ivy League students, Google+ is doing its shakedown cruise with fans and friends and family in the first batch. Who wouldn&#39;t like to try out a new, expensive, mostly empty system and establish yourself in it? I&#39;m waiting for the next round of invites, and hoping to enjoy it while it&#39;s in early growth stages and not when it&#39;s in long-in-the-tooth maintenance mode.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I walked a lot more today than I normally would have walked, thanks to my new game <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game.html" target="_self">Walking Around</a>. Here&#39;s some of the bonus points I scored that I wouldn&#39;t have scored in my previous quest, Sitting Around Typing.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Path (+1). It&#39;s always good to find a way to get from here to there that&#39;s not on any map. The pedestrian path I found connects Needham Road to Amelia Place. I&#39;ve added that little segment to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_self">Open Street Map</a> so that I can find it again, and so that I can cut through one more neighborhood with confidence. My son and I took this route to his summer camp today, and he suggested one more point for Unfamiliar Route (+1).</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 3" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Unexpected Lunch Companions (+2). If you wait for the bus at a bus stop near a restaurant, and if someone you know happens to be driving to that restaurant, then not only can you have an unexpectedly pleasant lunch but you can also get a ride downtown. Thanks to the Toziers for the happy coincidence and for a beginning of a discussion of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Annexation" target="_self">annexation and township islands</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 4" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 4" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Urban Foraging (+1). Juneberries are in season, which means that a carefully selected path will take you past some delicious snacks, right out there in the open, where thousands of people walk each day but none notice except the birds and a few brave souls who appreciate <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org/city/Juneberries" target="_self">Amalanchier</a>. For more berrypicking ideas, I follow Linda Diane Feldt&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/wildcrafting" target="_self">@wildcrafting</a> Twitter account. For lots more detail on Amalanchier, the 1946 <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24609952M/American_species_of_Amelanchier" target="_self">American Species of Amalachier</a> has ranges and keys for native species.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 5" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 5" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Park Benches (+2). If, at the end of your trek, you stop to wait for the bus - then it&#39;s useful to note that sometimes the bus stop is close to a park which has a park bench in the shade. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Douglas_Park" target="_self">Douglas Park</a>&#0160;is a nice place to wait for the #4, especially if you have <a href="http://mobile.theride.org/" target="_self">RideTrak</a> running on your cell phone to tell you when to get up and walk to the stop 1/2 block south of the park. My walk the next morning circled around all the way back to this park bench.</p>
<p>North Star (+1). A nice night walk on a clear night gives you all of the directions you need when Polaris is visible in the north sky. The drawing is from H. A.

<p>How do I come up with this bonus point structure? If you walk around enough, something that you see or do is bound to make you happy. Give yourself points for those happy places, and know where they are so that you can revisit them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s played.</p>
<p>First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including <a href="http://walkertracker.com/" target="_self">Walker Tracker</a>, <a href="http://swellnessresearch.wordpress.com/projects/steps/" target="_self">Steps</a>, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily.</p>
<p>Second - and here is what is novel, at least to me - is that there&#39;s a bonus structure in the game designed to award bonuses for when you have accomplished tasks. The first bonus award that I&#39;m awarding myself looks at constructing a walk so that you make an orbit around the biggest possible chunk of territory; that is to say, repeated walks along the same path will get you zero bonus, but going out of your way on a detour will add to your score, and trekking through unfamiliar territory in a big loop is the best.</p>
<p>So far this is a pen and paper game and I haven&#39;t fully worked out the point structure. I have a notion that you capture territory every time you orbit it, so that you might win a park by going all the way around it, and you might win a political ward or precinct by capturing a loop around it. To simplify greatly, since I am trying to keep record of this in a small book, I&#39;m just drawing a graph with destinations rather than tracking every street.</p>
<p>Some idea sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aadl.org/node/18868" target="_self">Riverwalks Ann Arbor</a>&#0160;is a book of walking loops along the Huron River, written by&#0160;Brenda E. Bentley.</p>

I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to beat that top score.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://play.aadl.org/" target="_self">AADL Summer Reading Game</a>&#0160;has points for reading books and badges for doing various other tasks, and the gamers there know how to make a game that will make you read.

      </h3>
      <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.</p>
<p>Some background for context.</p>
<p>The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3149678" target="_self">Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families</a> (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-24-unpolished-open-notebook/">Unpolished writing in the open notebook</a>
      </h3>
      <p><em>Steve Crocker, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3" target="_self">Internet Request for Comments 3</a>, from 1969: &quot;There is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.&quot;</em></p>
<p>From time to time, someone reads Vacuum and comments that the writing looks unpolished and incomplete. Why would you publish this kind of work, which obviously isn&#39;t up to the standards that would let you sell it to someone for use in print? Why wouldn&#39;t you hide it in your notebooks?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this weblog as a notebook, and publishing my notes for myself instead of always as a tightly edited, polished, finished work. By exposing this part of a process I hope to be prepared to find some way to make myself understood, even if I don&#39;t completely understand myself immediately as I write through an issue or question. Thoughts go in, get refined as far as they need to be to make them coherent, and then go onto the net and into the world so that there&#39;s room for the next piece to emerge.</p>
<p>The open notebook is going to be messy, but it also means that I have some hope of finding my own half-finished work and revisiting it years later; when I don&#39;t do that, there&#39;s always something lost. Writing this way lets me tune into ideas, spin them around for a bit until I have a clearer focus, and move on. In most cases, I&#39;m not ready to make things shiny and neat, and I&#39;m content to explore facets of an unpolished gem over a series of years.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at <a href="http://www.discardia.com" target="_self">discardia.com</a>. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.</p>
<p>For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. Before you can do a rebuild of a model that you already have, you need to find all of the impossibly tiny scattered pieces that make it up. A multipart storage box container is a great way to occupy a small boy&#39;s hour cleaning and sorting, because only when you have all of the yellow pieces together do you find the tiny Lego-sized firefighters accessories. Once you get down to the level that you can find the tiny black fireman&#39;s axe, the small child is content to build with it rather than agitate to buy more.</p>
<p>Books are my bane of accumulation existence, to the point where deciding what to do with them takes more energy than actually reading them. We have used Paperback Swap to maintain a steady state of inventory and still get new reading materials, and Books By Chance to dispose of surplus. Fortunately, the Lego situation (q.v.) is under control enough that I have reclaimed one bookshelf, which is being carefully curated as best I can to contain the collection that I would keep if it were my only shelf of books. Every decision to add to it means there&#39;s a corresponding decision to remove a book, and that keeps the shelf from accumulating dust and ennui.</p>
<p>The element of my life that absorbs more time than it should is the Internet, especially the Internet of flitting around from site to site trying to decide that someone has written something new worth writing. My self control is weak for shiny new things, but what I have discovered is that I can replace self control with ritual sometimes, and a ritual of writing on a specific topic for a specific person rather than reading aimlessly repays the time. I don&#39;t know yet how to cure a ritual addiction to being online, though Paul Jones&#39;s &quot;no email&quot; project points to one way to discard a portion of the online existence while staying connected.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Dinah Sanders for the &quot;decide and do&quot; theme for this season&#39;s <a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a>.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">Potholes and performance warranties for road construction</a>
      </h3>
      <p>After a rough winter, potholes are <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">ubiquitous</span> on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.</p>
<p>The technology to <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">repair</span> a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. In comparison, preventing a pothole from appearing in the first place means spending a lot more capital on road construction to build a more sturdy roadbed capable of handling heavier loads and less likely to buckle or crumble with frost.</p>
<p>At an extreme, you get the original World War Two era Davison Freeway in Detroit, which was <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">over-engineered</span> so that no highway problems would get in the way of the speedy shipment of materials for the war effort. That roadbed lasted from 1942 to 1997 - beat up and dangerous at the end, but still working 55 years before it was rebuilt.</p>
<p>To spend less on pothole repair, spend more on road construction? Perhaps, though there is no guarantee that new pavement will withstand daily traffic. A possible solution is to <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">give a contract which specifies that the road builder is also the road maintainer</span>, and that the cost of a pothole repair comes out of whatever profits were made by the building of the road. At least in theory, it would allow someone to make a reasonable tradeoff between current capital costs and future operations costs of maintaining a road; in practice, it probably would mean <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">low-ball bidding</span> by bidders who would build insubstantial roads and then under-deliver on the promise of keeping them maintained.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.qxork.com" target="_self">Fred Posner</a> for the prompt to write about this, and to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peggypage" target="_self">Peggy Page</a>&#0160;for post-publication editorial feedback. Previously on potholes: the Ann Arbor&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/a2csr.html" target="_self">Citizen Request System</a>. <a href="http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Casestudy/Davison.htm" target="_self">Archival photos of the Davison Freeway</a> under construction and at its first opening show the impact that freeway building has on a neighborhood. A <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100303-25651.html" target="_self">2010 story</a> describes potholes for sale in eastern Germany, with the purchaser getting a sponsorship message on the repair; a <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/kfc-and-peta-vie-to-fix-potholes/" target="_self">similar stunt in 2009</a> featured road repair by KFC.&#0160;&#0160;The city has a dedicated phone number to report potholes: call 734-99-HOLES.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em>Addendum: After publishing a first draft of this piece, I found this <a href="www.house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/warrant.pdf" target="_self">2001 Michigan House Fiscal Agency report on performance warranties for road construction</a>, which goes into some more of the purchasing process for major roadwork to understand how a road builder might manage a contract that required them to make whole a road that had not lived up to promises. It notes that a &quot;warranty bond&quot; would be required to ensure that if the road builder went out of business that the road would still be maintained - a sizable cost that would limit the number of bidders. A report from a <a href="http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/main.asp?secid=11464" target="_self">performance-based warranty for a rebuild of US 550 in New Mexico</a>&#0160;describes a successful project for a difficult road; the warranty costs are substantial, amounting to 20% of the total bid.&#0160;</em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-prediction-markets/">Prediction markets are too easy to game, so let&#39;s play games instead</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Prediction markets provide a nice, idealized way to use market mechanisms to predict the future. They are a slightly idealized version of an office betting pool and allow small scale bets (real or virtual) on future events. Unlike a real futures market, where you can get guarantees of future performance on things like delivery of gasoline or frozen orange juice, there&#39;s no way that betting on some prospective GOP hopeful will lift your candidate to office.</p>
<p>Market manipulation is the bane of most prediction markets. Consider Intrade, a prediction market in which GOP hopefuls are listed. The media will report that a newcomer is trading well, but won&#39;t necessarily note that the frontrunner&#39;s place is based on less than $500 worth of daily trades. If someone were to want to bump their favorite over the top for at least a little while it would only take pocket money from a proper hidden campaign pocket to game the system in your favor.</p>
<p>Gaming the system is a problem in systems that pretend to be markets, and where some ideal form of market is lionized as a way to gain enlightenment from the invisible hand of Adam Smith. Turning the system into a game to be one sullies the economist&#39;s ideals of a rational allocation of resources based on infinite economic rigor.</p>
<p>Why fight people&#39;s tendencies to want to subvert the intent of the system builder? The new hot trend in online environments is gamification, where gaming the system becomes the whole goal of the system. Unlike markets, which try to come to truth with some single-valued score of value, games have the opportunity to bring the world into a lovely multi-valued focus, with different people winning each at their own version of the game. The introduction of badges, short term competitions, lots of ways to score points and other fun side games overwhelms the narrow trading interests in market-based predicitons.&#0160;</p>
<p>The future of prediction markets lives inside complex predictive games. The game design has to take into account not only the rapid conclusions that you can draw when you have an efficient market for opinions, but also the continuous efforts you have to keep up to maintain people&#39;s attention on a topic for any length of time. The good games reward active participation; the challenge becomes how to draw conclusions from the work of engaged gamers working inside your system.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://xca2.com/" target="_self">Brian Kerr</a> for the idea. Games are on my mind because of the work of the Ann Arbor District Library and Eli Neiburger to <a href="http://play.aadl.org" target="_self">build games into the summer reading program</a> at the library. I tried to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2007/02/predicting_hold.html" target="_self">predict library use</a>&#0160;with a prediction market in 2007, and <a href="http://home.inklingmarkets.com/markets/17016" target="_self">attendance at lunch</a>&#0160;in 2009, using Inkling Markets. The game of choice at the Workantile Exchange is a version of bingo; when I bring my kid to work an alert player may win. The <a href="http://www.intrade.com/v4/markets/contract/?contractId=652757" target="_self">Intrade GOP market</a> shows the book of available trades; at this writing, purchasing about 300 shares of Mitt Romney would push the price up 8% at a cost of less than $1200. <a href="http://www.empireavenue.com/" target="_self">Empire Avenue</a> turns social media friendships into a giant game, with badges and prizes.</em></p>

<p><strong>How many people are affected by the flooding?</strong></p>
<p>12,000 people are in the evacuation zone anticipating an alert for immediate evacuation on June 22, 2011 (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/22/us-flooding-plains-idUSTRE75L43H20110622" target="_self">Reuters</a>). Evacuations started June 1. The population of Minot is about 40,000.</p>
<p>Among the organizations affected by the flood is the Minot Air Force Base, which has opened a 24x7 emergency center to assist military families (<a href="http://www.minot.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123260870" target="_self">MAFB</a>). About 1,000 military personnel with homes in Minot have been displaced by the flood (<a href="http://www.minotdailynews.com/page/content.detail/id/556042/National-Guard--Minot-AFB-members-in-the-flood-battle.html?nav=5010">Minot Daily News</a>).</p>
<p>Flood damages are estimated at more than $90 million, according to a Minnesota Public Radio report.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-21-link-languages/">Link languages for navigating through a landscape of words</a>
      </h3>
      <div>
<blockquote>“People writing in a wiki often put important concepts or terms on separate pages in order to refer to them. If the name of such a page is repeatedly used by many to point to an idea described or discussed on it, the page has become a part of the <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">link language</span> of the respective wiki-community.”&#0160;–&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/RadomirDopieralski">RadomirDopieralski</a>&#0160;&amp;&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/MattisManzel">MattisManzel</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004">LinkLanguage2004</a></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004"></a>If you do a lot of writing on one topic, there are recurrent themes and key words and phrases that repeat themselves. The more specialized the topic, the more likely it is that the reader coming in for the first time will want to unpack some of the&#0160;<span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">coded language</span>&#0160;that you are using and look for some background so that they can understand what precisely it is that you are trying to say. The coded language will include some special words that only you yourself understand, and you hope that by repetition in a variety of contexts that someone else will pick up eventually on what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>A test of your ability to participate in a specialized community is your ability to readily understand what is being said when those code words come up and appreciate some bundle of meanings and allusions that they are supposed to&#0160;trigger. &quot;Rosemary for remembrance&quot;, and when rosemary is mentioned in a song you are expected to bring that meaning with you. Close readers of Bible texts with their <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">careful concordances</span> share the same <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">sensitive ear </span>to all of the echoes of where a particular word or phrase is repeated for a specific effect that has been cultivated over the ages.&#0160;</p>
<p>The challenge in wiki is that the links are made explicit, and that they typically resolve to one particular concrete instance of one interpretation of an idea, as collectively edited within that wiki. If your link language is <span style="background-color: #ffdfbf;">perpetually inward focused</span>, you coerce the world you are building to look inward upon itself rather than providing some parallel outward-looking view.</p>
<p>If you back out of that system and consider broader possibilities, think of the problem as similar to constructing a <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">readable&#0160;</span><span style="background-color: #dcd1df;">command language</span>&#0160;in which invoking a particular phrase causes action to happen in the world. The Unix shell language is one particular instance of a command language, with its regular expressions as underpinnings for a system that expresses connections between processing elements as though there were data moving through plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Command languages gain some value because some of the encoding is made explicit. The difference can be readily seen in systems where hyperlinks to corporate names behave differently than hyperlinks to concepts or ideas. A business newswire will generally encode the name of the ticker symbol for a stock into a <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">specific referencable entity</span>, so that you don&#39;t have to interpret or guess what is being mentioned on the wire. Similarly, a link to a person&#39;s name in a news article could readily reference a biographical page or trigger a search for that specific name over a set of contact databases.</p>
<p>An advantage of recognizing this as a command language and not just a syntax for easy linking is that you can avoid the naive assumption that everyone who reads the language interprets it the same way. The language describes links between two parts of an <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">flexibly articulated wordscape</span>, but it&#39;s up to the reader to resolve that link into something concrete. The modern web software fails to live up to the promise of understanding just how many variant interpretations there might be of one specific phrase, trading ease of linking for richness in expression.</p>
<p>Alas, the most prominent of command-based link languages degenerates into something very simple: &quot;buy now&quot;. The corresponding linguistic improvement is almost always &quot;make the buy button bigger&quot;. The language of electronic commerce degenerates into deducing which <span style="color: #ffbfff;">three weird words</span> will make the reader click through a link, guaranteed.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.markdilley.com" target="_self">Mark Dilley</a> for the idea, imperfectly explored here. John Lawler&#39;s <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/routledge/unix.html" target="_self">Unix for Linguists</a>&#0160;gave inspiration, as did the great weird ideas of Pete Kaminski as we were sorting out wiki syntax at Socialtext. At some point along the way, there was a universal wish to avoid needing any syntax in order to make links among related items, but the details as ever are elusive.&#0160;</em></p>

<p>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&#39;s Day at <span style="background-color: #ff80bf;">Rowe&#39;s</span> in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends.</p>
<p>The boys are at the age where they are quick at berry picking and accurate enough not to pick bad berries. They are capable of picking more than they can eat. I&#39;m looking forward to more berrypicking with them!</p>
