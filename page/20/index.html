This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay.
I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-01-ann-arbor-library-lot-exit-problems-on-new-years-eve/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>December 30, 31 2013: Two BNSF trains collided about a mile west of Casselton, North Dakota, setting the crude oil that one of them was carrying on fire. The toxic plume of smoke from the fire has led to evacuations of the city, which is 25 miles west of Fargo. The fire's black smoke is visible from space, as seen in the GOES satellite image below.

 Meteorologist Aaron White: The smoke plume from the train collision was large enough that it could be seen on the visible satellite imagery just before sunset. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-31-trains-collide-in-casselton-north-dakota-leading-to-giant-fireball-and-toxic-fire/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy of something I've already written and published somewhere else. That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by googling my blog posts.

        <p>In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.
In the winter months it's harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it's warm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-revisiting-walker-tracker/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite".
The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-the-first-draft-of-this-essay-was-140-characters-or-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious).
The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-spicy-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-salad/">&raquo;</a></p>

 On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-23-maps-of-south-sudan-and-its-capital-city-of-juba/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.
Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-23-blogging-is-easy/">&raquo;</a></p>

Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it's a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford.

 The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms.

        <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.
For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-18-facebook-and-obituaries-part-2/">&raquo;</a></p>
