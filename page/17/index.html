      </h3>
      <p>According to Facebook, none of my friends have a birthday today. How many friends do I have to have so that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that there will be a birthday every day of the year?</p>
<p>An answer comes from the blog <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/" target="_self">Math Goes Pop!,</a> referencing the well known <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/07/math-gets-around-on-birthdays-and-trading-cards.html">&quot;coupon collector&#39;s problem&quot;.</a></p>
<blockquote>What’s known about this problem? Well, as I said above, even if you buy hundreds of thousands of cards, or stuff millions of people in a room, there’s no guarantee that you’ll collect every card or every date. However, on average, the number of cards you’ll need to go through to complete a set of size n is about n*log n.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In terms of birthdays, this says that if you want to collect every date, on average you’ll need to pool together around 2,153 people. Why such a large number? It’s not unreasonable to expect something like this – when you first begin collecting people, it won’t be hard to get people with different birthdays. However, as your numbers increase, you’ll get a new birthday less and less frequently. Finding that last birthday could prove to be quite elusive.</blockquote>
<p>No birthdays today means no existential angst about filling in witty, brief birthday greetings to all of your friends. You could have <a href="http://www.skelliewag.org/why-you-should-start-a-swipe-file-today-137.htm">swipe file</a> of pithy and varied greetings that can be cut and pasted in with loving care. (Especially if you have 2,153 people to greet annually.)</p>

<p>A spill on this pipeline near Milwaukee led to it being shut down for a time this week, and even though the pipeline is back in operation, the effects linger in the form of a fuel shortage in the UP. Prices have gone up because distributors need to make an extra long run from Milwaukee to get their supplies.</p>
<p>In response to this, Michigan&rsquo;s Governor Snyder has declared a fuel emergency for the UP. <a href="http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=780149#.UA9gb2kUHF9" target="_self">From TV6 in Marquette:</a></p>
<blockquote>The executive order makes drivers of gasoline trucks exempt from weekly hours of service restrictions to make sure demand is met.&nbsp; The order remains in effect until it is rescinded or until August 7 at 11:59 p.m., whichever comes first.&nbsp; Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker also declared an energy emergency on Saturday.</blockquote>
<p>As noted in the comments on the TV6 story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, I think for the first time ever there was a real reason for a spike in gas prices in the UP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good to know the maps of key infrastructure so you can see after the fact how systems are interdependent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE July 26, 2012: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that wells in the area of the pipeline spill have been contaminated. <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/washington-county-pipeline-break-soils-private-wells-5p68kib-163798766.html" target="_self">Story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private wells at three rural homes north of Western Ave. in the Town of Jackson are contaminated with gasoline that spilled out of a break discovered last week in a regional pipeline, a spokesman for West Shore Pipe Line Co. said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Benzene levels in water from the wells exceed the federal safe drinking water standard of 5 parts per billion, and those families will be provided bottled water. Benzene is known to cause cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UPDATE October 9, 2013: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel continues to track the spread of benzene from the gasoline spill. <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/large-gasoline-spill-linked-to-benzene-detected-in-village-of-jackson-well-b99115765z1-226939341.html">The story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A July 2012 gasoline pipeline spill in the Town of Jackson is the likely source of benzene detected in a Village of Jackson municipal well in May of this year, a village consultant&rsquo;s investigation determined.
<p>
This is the first contamination of a municipal well linked to the spill of 54,600 gallons of gasoline from a fuel distribution line owned by West Shore Pipe Line Co. of Illinois.
<p>
A total of 44 private wells in the town within a 1-mile radius of the spill have been contaminated with benzene or other gasoline compounds, records show.
<p>
Though well No. 6 is more than 2 miles northwest of the pipeline rupture, pumping of the well in early July determined it drew ground water out of fractured dolomite rock beneath the spill site in the 1800 block of Western Ave., according to the consultant&rsquo;s report.

<p>The 2012 Michigan hay crop is not looking good, due to widespread drought conditions. <a href="http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/still_time_to_increase_2012_hay_crop/" target="_self">From Michigan State Extension</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dry weather of 2012 has left most livestock producers in the Midwest scrambling for more hay. First cutting hay yields were down 20 – 40 percent in much of Michigan and with the dry weather intensifying, total hay yields for the year could be off by 50 percent or more. In order to feed ruminant animals such as beef cattle, sheep and others through the winter season many are looking for ways stretch their feed resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their first recommendation is &quot;Cover what you have first&quot;. Losses due to spoilage range from 4-7 percent for well-covered hay to 20-35 percent for baled hay left out in the fields.</p>
<p>If you need hay as feed, one source (for information at least) is the <a href="http://www.hayexchange.com/" target="_self">Internet Hay Exchange</a>. It&#39;s a marvel of Craiglist-style old school Internet simplicity in design, with offers from hay sellers for each state. As of this writing, a big round bale of alfalfa/timothy hay would set you back $60 picked up from Montague, MI, or $80 delivered, according to <a href="http://www.hayexchange.com/display_detail_hay.php?id=43117" target="_self">this listing</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedgeree" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Kedgeree">Kedgeree</a> - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water</li>
<li>safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it</li>
<li>spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar</li>
<li>vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
<li>fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon</li>
<li>greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch</li>
<li>hard boiled eggs for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p>The method runs roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Cook the rice first; if you happen to have enough leftover rice, you can use that.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large pan, and saute the onion (and possibly garlic) for 3-5 minutes until soft. Add the spices which will give the onions a wonderful color and smell when thoroughly mixed.</p>
<p>Mix in the vegetables so that they are heated through or cooked; again, suitably prepared leftovers would work here.</p>
<p>Add the rice to the onion mixture, stirring well. Add lemon juice.</p>
<p>Flake the fish and mix in with the rice. Mix in chopped parsley or cilantro. Stir well, and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with hard boiled eggs if desired.</p>
<p>- end -</p>

      <p>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&#39;s going on in real time.

<p>There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary. To help follow this, Twitter had adopted the #aacitycouncil hash tag to follow along. Last night, though, AnnArbor.com reporter Ryan Stanton had this great suggestion:</p>

      <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.</p>
<p>The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either).</p>
<p>The blog Brandland USA did this <a href="http://www.brandlandusa.com/2008/07/02/were-lovin-remastered-casey-kasem-at-40/">2008 piece on the revival of American Top 40</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Yes, you can still catch Casey Kasem’s original 1970s American Top 40 radio shows on your local FM. The shows have returned from a tape morgue in Hollywood, and have been completely remastered. They were remastered by “syndicated radio junkies” at the Cabot, Arkansas based audio restoration firm Charis Music Group. Charis has posted original “Cue sheets” on its website so nostalgia junkies like us can read along with the shows.</blockquote>
<p>And with that hint, I was able to search enough to find this set listing on <a href="http://staxofwaxtopofthepops.blogspot.com/2012/07/casey-kasems-at40-80s-july-7th-2012.html" target="_self">Stax of Wax</a>, the precise music played 30 years ago on the July 4 weekend show in 1982.&#0160;</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR (June 29, 2012) An intense storm called a derecho with long lived straight line winds passed to the south of the area today. The <a href="http://disastermapping.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/6292012-derecho-long-lived-wind-event/" target="_self">Disaster Mapping weblog entry 6/29/2012 Derecho</a> has a good summary of the impact to the power grid from storm, which had knocked out power to over 3 million people as of 11:45 p.m from Illinois all the way to DC. Wind gusts of over 90 miles per hour were clocked in some areas as the storm blew through.

<blockquote>
<p>June 26, 2012 — The University of Virginia&#0160;<strong><a href="http://www.virginia.edu/bov">Board of Visitors&#0160;</a></strong>today voted unanimously to reinstate Teresa A. Sullivan as president.</p>
<p>University Rector Helen E. Dragas apologized for actions that sparked the controversy and pledged that she will work with Sullivan to capture the energy from the events of the past three weeks to address the issues confronting the University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Virginia Libraries is documenting this turn in the power struggle at UVA, which saw Sullivan ousted from her post by the Board of Visitors. From the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/uva-creates-archive-documenting-sullivans-resignation/37295" target="_self">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>:</p>

<p>The University of Virginia library staff is archiving materials related to the recent events&#0160;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Teresa-Sullivan-Resigns-From/132417/">that forced Teresa A. Sullivan to resign</a>&#0160;as president of the institution.</p>
<p>This is the first time the libraries have tried to preserve materials from a large-scale, continuing event, said Bradley Daigle, director of digital-curation services. The staff did not begin collecting materials on the subject until a rally on June 18. As of June 22, the team has archived nearly 20,000 tweets, 61 blog posts, over 200 media posts, and about 100 physical objects, such as signs from protests.</p>

<p>As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide.</p>
<p>Quite a few positions are filled without going through online job boards, of course - but it never hurts to see what&#39;s posted and available.</p>

      <p>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us. He could find out literally anything.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking for a (very) local map that shows damage, but events are too chaotic right now to get that. <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/234930/" target="_self">Damage estimates are in the millions</a>, with extensive damage to infrastructure (roads, bridges) that will take time and money to fix.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/" target="_self">Global Tuners</a> is a worldwide project for people to share their shortwave radio receivers. There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Global-tuners-perth-australia" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-500wi" alt="Global-tuners-perth-australia" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. That&rsquo;s been successful up to a point, but compared to the last time I was following this world (20 years ago) there&rsquo;s a lot less in the English language and more in Chinese. Getting access to tuners around the world, especially to ones that have better antenna setups than I do, is remarkably handy.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can use a shortwave set for most of the time is listening to AM and FM stations that are aimed at a local audience. Here is where some of the most unusual listening comes in - it&rsquo;s just plain fun to tune in an Australian FM station (via a tuner in Australia) and listen to what ordinary radio sounds like there.</p>
<p>For best results, you&rsquo;ll want to pair this with some lookup tools that help you figure out what&rsquo;s on the air at that time that&rsquo;s likely to be heard in that part of the world. <a href="http://short-wave.info" target="_self">Short-wave.info</a> has a nice real time database of broadcast schedules, so that if you are tuning around the dial on shortwave you can see which stations are likely to be broadcasting. &nbsp;<a href="http://fmscan.org/index.php" target="_self">FMSCAN</a> has global listings of AM and FM stations, and <a href="http://www.mwlist.org/ul_login.php?sprache=en" target="_self">MWLIST</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;longwave, mediumwave, tropical bands and a shortwave radio database. It&rsquo;s the kind of information that I recall from sorting through the back pages of the World Radio and TV Handbook, except that it&rsquo;s all linked together (and more up to date than my 1980s copy).</p>

      <p>When you notice <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak.html" target="_self">a big LinkedIn password breach</a> one day, and then several other sites also announce problems in subsequent days, there seems to be a pattern worth noticing. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed of late.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/" target="_self">Flame virus uses a previously undiscovered attack on the MD5 cryptographic hash</a> in order to carry out some of its devious work.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flame is the first known example of an MD5 collision attack being used maliciously in a real-world environment. It wielded the esoteric technique to digitally sign malicious code with a fraudulent certificate that&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-malware-was-signed-by-rogue-microsoft-certificate/">appeared to originate with Microsoft</a>. By deploying fake servers on networks that hosted machines already infected by Flame—and using the certificates to sign Flame modules—the malware was able to&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flames-god-mode-cheat-code-wielded-to-hijack-windows-7-server-2008/">hijack the Windows Update mechanism</a>&#0160;Microsoft uses to distribute patches to hundreds of millions of customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking over Windows Update is game over for a compromised system, and of course it&#39;s also an efficient way to keep your bugged system up to date with the latest bugs. Flame is thus suspected of being created by a powerful nation-state, since the crypto needed to do this is beyond the grasp of but a few skilled mathematicians.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bricklink.com" target="_self">Bricklink</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/messageThread.asp?ID=133899&amp;amp;nID=642624" target="_self">their admin user id was stolen</a>, and a number of accounts were fraudulently merged together. No word yet on how the attacker(s) got access to the key account on the system, and I haven&#39;t seen any other reporting about problems at this LEGO trading site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a few people noticed, a number of major accounts were merged fraudulently&#0160;around 12:15 pm EDT today. As a merge is almost impossible to undo, the solution&#0160;was to do a database rollback to 12:00 PM EDT today. This breach was due to the&#0160;Admin user ID being stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>TheNextWeb writes about <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/06/07/change-your-last-fm-password-now-there-may-have-been-another-security-breach/" target="_self">problems at last.fm which is reporting a big password leak</a> on the scale of LinkedIn. The <a href="http://www.last.fm/passwordsecurity" target="_self">last.fm notice</a> reads in part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently investigating the leak of some Last.fm user passwords. This follows recent password leaks on other sites, as well as information posted online. As a precautionary measure, we’re asking all our users to change their passwords immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Passwords are a weak link in many online systems, and password database security gets short shrift in some growing startups. Perhaps these two tweets from Pinboard&#39;s founder&#0160;Maciej Ceglowski are worth noting to round out the report.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>Proud to reassure my users that&#0160;<strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;passwords are not only hashed and salted, but pan-seared and dusted with a saffron quince reduction</div>

      </h3>
      <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!</p>
<p>I used the <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Home-Repair/Appliance-Repair/how-to-repair-a-leaking-washing-machine/View-All" target="_self">Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine</a>&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. The repair was made with <a href="http://www.duckbrand.com/Products/diy-products/diy-specialties/self-fusing-repair-tape.aspx" target="_self">Duck Brand Wrap-Fix Tape</a>, a self-fusing silicone tape that says it&#39;s good to 100 PSI.&#0160;And <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Stadium_Hardware" target="_self">Stadium Hardware</a>&#0160;(Arborwiki link) is a marvelous store, with helpful folks and a seemingly infinite supply of parts for every hardware need.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s just hope the repair holds! The next step, if it doesn&#39;t, is to replace that hose entirely. Repair Clinic has <a href="http://www.repairclinic.com/GE-Washing-Machine-Hose-Tube-Or-Fittings-Parts?z=100" target="_self">about 70 different GE washing machine hose parts available</a>; I haven&#39;t yet identified the exact part.&#0160;</p>
<p>Please note that the repair for the high-pressure supply hose would be very different, as noted in the comment below. The Family Handyman guide referenced above suggests getting a metallic no-burst supply hose <a href="http://www.fluidmaster.com/washing-machine-connectors.html/" target="_self">similar to this one from Fluidmaster</a> to replace any worn, corroded, or leaky supply hoses. Supply lines run at much higher pressure than drain lines.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Change your LinkedIn password.</p>
<p>News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. LinkedIn, for its part, has promised to strengthen its internal controls and introduce a &quot;salt&quot; into its password storage system.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/" target="_self">An update from LinkedIn</a>&#0160;acknowledges the leak. The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/06/technology/linkedin-password-hack/index.htm" target="_self">reporting from CNN</a> is unusually detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Countless passwords on the list contain the word &quot;linkedin.&quot; On a&#0160;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">popular hacker forum</a>, many reported finding passwords such as &quot;linkedout,&quot; &quot;recruiter,&quot; &quot;googlerecruiter,&quot; &quot;toprecruiter,&quot; &quot;superrecruiter,&quot; &quot;humanresources&quot; and &quot;hiring.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leak was complicated by LinkedIn&#39;s use of SHA-1 as its encryption scheme for passwords without using a &quot;salt&quot; to improve password security. <a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/06/06/a-salt-free-diet-is-bad-for-your-security/" target="_self">AgileBits has a good discussion of how salting works</a>, and why you should use it; in short, it adds a little more randomness to even bad passwords so that an attacker can&#39;t pre-compute the hashed stored passwords directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Bot and Alice use the same password (and so have the same hash of their passwords) they don’t have to worry about each other. Who they need to worry about is Charlie the Cracker. Charlie may have spent months running software that picks passwords and generates the hashes of those passwords. He will store those millions of passwords and their hashes in a database called a “Rainbow Table.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without a rainbow table, modern password cracking hardware is mighty fast. How fast? <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2012/06/confirmed-linkedin-6mil-password-dump.html" target="_self">Robert Graham from Errata Security lays it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;How fast can hackers crack passwords? The answer &quot;2 billion per second&quot; using the Radeon HD 7970 (the latest top-of-the-line graphics processor). Each letter of a password has 100 combinations (UPPER, lower, d1g1ts, $ymbols). A 5 letter password therefore has&#0160;<tt>100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100</tt>&#0160;or 10 billion combinations, meaning it can be cracked in 5 seconds. A 6 letter password has 100 times that, or 500 seconds. A 7 letter password has 100 times that, or 50,000 seconds, or 13 hours. An 8 character password is roughly 57 days. A 9 character password is 100 times that, about 15 years. In other words, if your password was 7 letters, the hacker has already cracked it, but if it&#39;s 9 letters, it&#39;s too difficult to crack with brute force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, &quot;too difficult&quot; for one computer is not the same as &quot;too difficult&quot; for a network of computing resources. Thomas Roth in 2010 on <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/15/cracking-in-the-cloud-amazons-new-ec2-gpu-instances/" target="_self">Cracking Passwords in the Cloud</a>&#0160;on Amazon&#39;s EC2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the CUDA-Multiforce, I was able to crack all hashes from&#0160;<a href="http://stacksmashing.net/blogfiles/2010_11_15/sha1_hashes.txt">this</a>&#0160;file with a password length from 1-6 in only 49 Minutes (1 hour costs 2.10$ by the way.):</p>
<div>
<div>Compute done: Reference time 2950.1 seconds<br />Stepping rate: 249.2M MD4/s<br />Search rate: 3488.4M NTLM/s</div>
</div>
<p>This just shows one more time that SHA1 for password hashing is deprecated – You really don’t want to use it anymore! Instead, use something like scrypt or PBKDF2! Just imagine a whole cluster of these machines (which is now easily available to anybody thanks to Amazon) cracking passwords for you. Pretty comfortable, large-scale password cracking for everybody!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 6 character SHA-1 hashes would cost about $2 to crack in 2010 computer-dollars; 7 characters, $200; 8 characters, $20,000; and 9 characters, &quot;only&quot; $2 million. <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/20/cracking-passwords-in-the-cloud-getting-the-facts-straight/" target="_self">Roth further concludes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that was new is that, due to the new Amazon offering, everyone is able to spawn a 100-or-more node cluster in the cloud and distribute the task of cracking passwords onto these nodes. The task of cracking hashes is especially suitable for massive parallelization! An attacker could easily spawn a gigantic cluster of nodes using stolen credit card information, and it would be no problem for him to crack 8-character passwords in a nice timeframe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, &quot;recruiter&quot;, step up your game (and change your password, and your password algorithm).</p>

It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do.</p>
<p>Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The maddening part of the network that doesn&#39;t work is that instead of working with the network you end up working to repair the network, and its unreliablity neither gives you access nor downtime.  In other words, spotty wifi is bad, worse than no wifi at all.</p>

      <p>My Mac is in the shop. It&#39;s getting a new wifi card, and while they are at it they&#39;ll replace the chipped case. The chip fixing means that labor is free for the wifi fixing so it&#39;s a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The last time I had any kind of extended computer downtime I remember it being a strain, since I then had so much of my personal computing stuff actually on my computer. Now more than ever that&#39;s not the case, and I get along just fine with occasional logins from library computer systems or even the ultra-basic stripped down version of apps that I get on my not-very-smart Blackberry.</p>
<p>At some point, everything that you care enough about is also in the cloud somewhere. That might be for backups, so that if you lose a system you can carry on with minimum restore time. It might be to increase the power of whatever web-enabled terminal you log into, so that whatever public system you connect to has most of your stuff even if that stuff is private. Mostly though things go into the cloud and stay there because all physical media are fragile. The consequences of relying on anything in your own possession - especially something that gets knocked around a bit - are too great, and it&#39;s better to have those things also or primarily somewhere else that feels safe.</p>

<p>SEMOLINA PUDDING<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 cup milk<br />4 cups water<br />grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)<br />1 cup semolina flour<br />cinnamon<br />raspberries or other berries<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. Remove from heat and pour into bowl, mold, or cupcake pan. Refrigerate for at least two hours. Pudding should be somewhat firmer than chocolate pudding, but less firm than jello.<br /><br />When ready to serve, unmold pudding or leave in bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon. Top with raspberries or other fruit. Sugared raspberries are particularly nice when a little bit of sauce is formed and can be poured over the pudding.<br /><br />The pudding has a texture that is somehow both agreeably grainy and smooth and is very cooling in the summertime. You can vary the milk:water ratio in the recipe, even to the point of omitting one or the other entirely.<br /><br />(thanks to puddingmeister Deb for the recipe)</p>

<p>The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#0160;<a name="isNewYorkTechDifferentFromCaliforniaTechThereMightBeSomeSlightDifferencesButYouCouldTakeATechConferenceFromCaliforniaPlopItDownInNycAndNotOnlyWouldTheSameIdeasBeDiscussedFromTheSamePerspectiveButMostOfThePeopleWouldBeTheSameTheApisAreCorporateApisTheCmsesAreSilosTheBusinessModelIsHamstersGeneratingLessMoneyWithEachTurnOfTheWheel">&#0160;</a><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/26/newYorkTech.html#isNewYorkTechDifferentFromCaliforniaTechThereMightBeSomeSlightDifferencesButYouCouldTakeATechConferenceFromCaliforniaPlopItDownInNycAndNotOnlyWouldTheSameIdeasBeDiscussedFromTheSamePerspectiveButMostOfThePeopleWouldBeTheSameTheApisAreCorporateApisTheCmsesAreSilosTheBusinessModelIsHamstersGeneratingLessMoneyWithEachTurnOfTheWheel"><img alt="permalink" border="0" height="9" src="http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" width="6" /></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. It makes me want to start something brand new of my own - but then - you end up being captured by all of the tools you have to learn to bring it online.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing to think through this is that all new shiny online services have a lifespan. Some of them grow quickly and then die (remember Pownce? I thought not), some of them grow slowly and still live on somehow (remember Plurk?), others never get off the ground (a dozen tiny spam-overrun Twitter clones), and a tiny handful make it to Twitter size. You generally don&#39;t know when you&#39;re starting to talk to people through some new online system whether you are going to treat it as a long-term commitment to learning a complex system, or just some hands-on experimentation in something to be ignored and forgotten in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So you are a hamster, and you see a wheel. Do you get on to try it out, give yourself some exercise, or do you go to your workshop and build a better wheel?</p>

      <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge.</p>
<p>Github is mostly about software, but there are lots of other things that lend themselves to incremental parallel development - development that doesn&#39;t have to follow the wiki model of last one in gets to edit. If you think of github (the hosting service) combined with some shared recipe archive (a la grouprecipes, the Usenet Cookbook, or whatever your favorite recipe starting place is) you&#39;re thinking about what I&#39;m thinking.</p>
<p>Lots of people cook the way you&#39;d expect, starting off from a given recipe and then branching out to accomodate the seasons, ingredients on hand, their own tastes and the tastes (picky) of their family. If I&#39;m doing a cookbook, I want to acknowledge that someone else&#39;s mac and cheese recipe was the starter of my own but I don&#39;t want to actually edit their cookbook in writing mine.</p>
<p>Besides, &quot;fork&quot; is such an obvious name for a cookbook tool.</p>

<p>The Duck Lake Fire team really needs to hear from people who have property located within the fire area (especially those property owners that may be out of state). U.P. residents call 211; all others call 800-338-1119. Please give your name, fire number and road, and contact info so we can provide updates as damage assessments are completed. (Folks who&#39;ve already called and provided fire number and road name do NOT need to call again.)&#0160;<br /><br /></p>

In The <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Phaedrus-Plato/dp/0872202208%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0872202208" rel="amazon" target="_blank" title="Phaedrus">Phaedrus</a>, Plato relates argument the argument of Socrates that writing is a technology which leads to a diminishing of intelligence and of understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soc. I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves. (<a href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm" target="_self">Plato, The Phaedrus</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keen doesn&#39;t quote from Plato, but he does credit himself a &quot;celebrated public speaker&quot;. It&#39;s important that someone have a reasonable criticism of today&#39;s social networks, just so we can understand them better <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">when they inevitably change or fail</a>. This particular text probably reads better as an ebook, with all of its carefully collected citations linked; it might, like the example of Phaedrus, be even better in person delivered by the speaker who can vary his answer to incorporate the changes of the day and defend his thoughts.</p>
<p>A good book for an airplane ride, or a good ebook for a contrarian romp through modern social networks hype or to congratulate yourself for missing the Facebook IPO.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m in the midst of a job hunt, and so I expect that people I talk to who don&#39;t know me very well will take a look at this weblog as part of the things they look for when trying to assess who I am or to help prepare them to make small talk as a part of discussion. This is a good and useful reason to write in a weblog, to make yourself easy to strike up a conversation with.</p>
<p>As blogs go, Vacuum is relatively old school in that it deals with everything and nothing - you&#39;ll find dozens of categories, ranging from strawberry picking to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/power-outage-mapping.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="Power Outage Mapping">power outages</a> to seasonal holidays to technical discussions in a variety of fields. If it looks like a somewhat eclectic notebook, that&#39;s because it is. At various times when the need has arisen I&#39;ve pulled out separate weblogs to corral related information together. Superpatron, for innovation in library systems, was the one that really took off to have a life of its own for a while. When I wrote for AnnArbor.com, a weekly column on <a class="zem_slink" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/foia-jobs-looking-for-all-of-your-ideas-on-foiachat.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="FOIA jobs: looking for all of your ideas on #FOIAchat">FOIA</a> had enough cohesion to look like a body of work and not just a collection of ephemeral interests.</p>
<p>When you create a resume crafted for a particular job, you emphasize the particular skills and abilities you have and by keeping it brief you remove a whole set of other things. When you blog voraciously over a decade, you collect a whole lot of things that look temporarily interesting but sometimes - perhaps more than sometimes - just turn out to be interesting of the moment.</p>
<p>So, hi. You&#39;re reading this. There&#39;s a lot here, if you search. If you ask about anything, there&#39;s probably more to be said. I assume that you&#39;ll understand if there&#39;s some things here that look unfinished, because that&#39;s by design.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Imagine that it&#39;s the year 2020; it&#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?</p>
<p><em>Something new</em></p>
<p>One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a perpetual demand for new means of expression online, and a perpetual supply of people trying to build an &quot;eyeball business&quot; to service that quest for novelty. The newness can express itself as exclusivity, or as a better way to share photographs, or by removing features that other systems take for granted. Whatever it is, the barriers for creating Yet Another Social Network Service are low.</p>
<p><em>Advertising may not sustain growth</em></p>
<p>A second possibility is that Facebook makes some same mistake that Myspace does of creating too much advertising inventory that&#39;s worth too little per use, and that marketing people and advertising people move their budgets elsewhere because they can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) want to prove their results. General Motors decided that both Facebook ads and Super Bowl ads were of little use, and they might be the harbinger of a bigger trend.</p>
<p>As communications systems grow, there are more and more pieces of them where no one has designed an ad specifically to target the niche that&#39;s being expressed in that one piece of online behavior. You thus end up with a huge inventory of space that has to be filled with something, and a need to create that supply of advertisers who don&#39;t really care where that ad goes as long as it&#39;s frequent.</p>
<p><em>The dream of the public internet</em></p>
<p>The Internet purist would hope that Facebook is displaced by open protocols and public interfaces, rather than private APIs. This is also the hope of every development team with a set of bright ideas unwilling to tether themselves to someone else&#39;s system.</p>
<p>The history of the public internet has been expansive growth at times (Usenet news, the World Wide Web) alternated with periods where the money and attention flowed into walled gardens (Compuserve, AOL). Facebook is more like AOL than it is like Usenet, and since it has to build all of its infrastructure it&#39;s at risk from innovative internetworked distributed systems where many people can play.</p>
<p>Usenet died of its own weight, overrun by success, by AOL users, and by spam and pornography. The Web spawned a whole series of mostly open systems, but really never reinvented Usenet in its pure form of distributed discussion groups where everyone you&#39;d want to talk to on every possible subject is always online. The net might just be too big to have something other than central control decisions make for orderly governance.</p>
<p><em>Mobile turns the tables</em></p>
<p>Finally, it&#39;s quite plausible that as more of our Internet time is absorbed in mobile devices that no one will figure out quickly how to take enough money from that particular set of users vs. the big-screen computer users who have lots of on-screen space for ads.</p>
<p>Imagine there&#39;s no Facebook; it&#39;s easy if you have a long memory back to eight years ago. There&#39;s some arc that innovative online systems go through from early adopter to mainstream to old news. A lot of new systems will try to capture our attention, our friendships, and our willingness to pay over the rest of the decade, and the network of 2020 will not simply be a bigger version of the net of 2012.</p>

<p>Ad Age Digital reports on <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/google-a-ghost-town-brands-decamp-pinterest/234867/">brand marketing and its fickle treatment of Google+</a> as newcomer Pinterest takes up reader and advertiser interest:</p>
<blockquote>Google+ launched brand pages six months ago, introducing new social lingo, including &quot;hangouts,&quot; &quot;circles&quot; and &quot;+1s.&quot; But strike up a conversation with a digital marketer these days, and talk of &quot;+1s&quot; has been replaced by that of &quot;pins.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/07/rushkoff.facebook.myspace/?hpt=Sbin ">2011 piece by Douglas Rushkoff</a> spells out the &quot;we&#39;ve seen it before&quot; attitude of other social networks and their short term success:</p>
<blockquote>If you were there for Compuserve, AOL, Tripod, Friendster, Orkut, MySpace or LinkedIn, you might have believed the same thing about any one of those social networks. Remember when those CD Roms from AOL came in the mail almost every day? The company was considered ubiquitous, invincible. Former AOL CEO Steve Case was no less a genius than Mark Zuckerberg.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/08/was-it-google-who-killed-myspace/">GigaOm in 2011 on Google and Myspace</a> and poor quality advertising:</p>
<blockquote>Think back to 2006: That’s when they signed the $900 million, three-year advertising deal to turn Google into Myspace’s exclusive providers of text ads and search. It was a great cash prize for Murdoch’s purchase, but actually ended up being a weight around its neck. The deal’s targets required Myspace to crank up page views and increase already-heavy advertising space at precisely the same moment that Facebook was pushing forward with a clean and easily-understood design.</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The problem of poor quality advertising on Facebook is noted in the context of <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57437885-71/how-zuckerbergs-wedding-reveals-facebooks-problem/">constipation ads on Zuckerberg&#39;s wedding announcement</a> by Chris Matyszczyk of CNET.</p>
<blockquote>If ads for heart attacks and constipation on its most important page of celebration are anything to go by, the company has a long, long way to go in order to even begin to make advertising work. May I wish the happy couple all the wealth, um, happiness in the world. I hope as they log on to Facebook this morning to view all the good wishes, they aren&#39;t being served with ads for divorce lawyers, marriage guidance counselors and, um, investment advisers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>increased user access to and engagement with Facebook through our mobile products, where we do not currently directly generate meaningful revenue, particularly to the extent that mobile engagement is substituted for engagement with Facebook on personal computers where we monetize usage by displaying ads and other commercial content;</blockquote>

<p>None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&#39;ll share those when I have them; it&#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day.</p>
