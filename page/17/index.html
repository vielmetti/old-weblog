Metalworkers, inventors, papermakers, artists, students, robot designers, enthusiasts and professional alike teach the public how they make their work. Many participants come away with more than just inspiration, but new skills they can use to fuel their own creations and lasting connections to other makers and resources in the region. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-24-ann-arbor-mini-maker-faire-may-10-2014-washtenaw-community-college/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From Facebook and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum: Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan. This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no "stay" pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-march-22-2014-washtenaw-county-clerk-to-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang'an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-april-3-2014-finn-brunton-on-cryptocurrencies-north-quad-space-2435-400-pm/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the new comment stream into Disqus. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-the-next-major-change-for-this-weblog-is-converting-over-comments-to-disqus/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a responsive design for this blog. Their new "Snap" theme gives you one design that works well on devices of various sizes. I'm liking it so far.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and book-buying habits show a schism between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides. Wayne Baker's new book United America looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-united-america-divided-media/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The challenge of being an expert is that it is hard to be one in your own home town. Expertise is valued when it comes from far away.

        <p>I was up late the other night when the news that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was missing came out. There was a flurry of speculation as to its whereabouts, but no hard news. I went to bed figuring that by morning the mystery would be resolved. That was four days ago, and the plane is still missing and the mystery has only deepened. Short of going on a search and rescue mission yourself, the closest that anyone can do to chip in on the search is to join in on Tomnod which has a crowd-sourced digital image recognition system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-12-the-mystery-of-flight-mh370/">&raquo;</a></p>

Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-09-a-review-of-social-physics-how-good-ideas-spread-the-lessons-from-a-new-science-alex-pentland/">&raquo;</a></p>
