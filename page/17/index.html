<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I use <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> (see: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html">previously</a>) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the projects pile up, and I forget what I was doing but still don't know what to focus on. The mindfulness project then is to go methodically through each of the tabs, dealing with whatever is on that page and then closing the tab instead of saving it. This has been a good way to feel like I don't have an infinite set of half-done efforts.</p>

<p>This map (one of many on the site) shows the overlap of what people map out when they say they are from Detroit. The densest is the downtown region only; the most generous encompasses a 9-county region. From Alex B.

<blockquote>
  <p>I chose to look at the first 100 images that appeared in a Google image search for “map of Detroit” and overlay the results. Many corporations based in Southfield, Warren, or Dearborn choose to say they are based in “Detroit,” Likewise, most regional organizations (Detroit Chamber, Detroit Water &amp; Sewage, SEMCOG, etc.) represent Detroit with boundaries that extend into surrounding municipalities, most commonly the tri-counties (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb). A number of the 100 maps show urban sprawl to varying degrees while some maps categorize municipalities around the city as “Detroit.” Some maps even included parts of Windsor, Ontario in the “metro Detroit” area. The larger boundaries match the Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as outlined by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which represent “Detroit” as either a 6 county area (MSA) or a 9 county area (CSA).</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4693">Talking to Vula</a> is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa. The account (which was pointed out to me by Finn Brunton) talks of an inventive use of encrypted text transmitted via analog modem tones recorded to cassette tape and then played back via untraceable pay phones. It's a remarkable tale of late 80s underground crypto, leading up to the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>

<p>From the text, to give you a flavor of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To test this hypothesis I wrote a little program to send some computer output to the modem. Sure enough the sounds came out of the modem`s speaker. These I recorded and played back into the microphone end of the modem while running a communications program on the computer. Eureka! The characters appeared on the screen. I had done with a modem what we were attempting to do with our tone machine.</p>
  
  <p>This seemed to be the real breakthrough. I adapted our encryption program to work with the acoustic modem and recorded the output on a tape recorder. This I took to a public telephone booth and played back to my answering machine. Then I played the answering machine <code>message</code> back into the modem and the computer deciphered it successfully. As the plaintext message appeared on the screen I realised that we had finally discovered an absolutely safe method of communicating with the underground using computers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work originally appeared in a series of six articles in the ANC`s monthly journal Mayibuye from May 1995 to October 1995. </p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/">Mack Collier</a> has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (<a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/how-to-write-awesome-blog-posts/">Here, go read it.</a>) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does.</p>

<p>Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!"  These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. They are not, however, how I write my weblog - and not a style for you, unless you are in a weird job where counting pageviews drives your wages.</p>

<p>The net has enough of the hyperkinetic blog fodder to go around. What it doesn't have, and needs, is bloggers who take an old-school approach to blog writing and who are careful and respectful of their audiences.</p>

<p>Blogging is about writing to pick up an audience, one that would read everything you had to say and comment on it. That means not only writing about what people might click on because their eye got caught by a headline, but also writing the day-in, day-out thematic and topical materials that someone who cares more than a little bit will follow along for detail.</p>

<p>Blogging is figuring out what sorts of regular obscure parts of the world that you cover and being a go-to resource for that issue when it comes up in the world. To illustrate, I bring you Dave Petley's <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/">Landslide Blog</a>. You won't find awesome stock photography, but you will find a whole series of carefully selected photos that illustrate the stories he writes about landslides and their origin and effect. Or see the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/">Backyard Arthropod Project</a>, which is a lovingly illustrated guide to the bugs of Atlantic Mine, MI with great macrophotography of bugs, beetles, insects, spiders, slugs, and more. There are dozens more like this, people who toil away in relative obscurity writing carefully about their craft, and I love them. It's a style that lends itself to slowly but surely being a recognized expert in your field. </p>

<p>I love weblogs that take a narrow view on some interesting part of the world and are thorough in how they document it. They don't need weird tricks or compelling lists or catchy copy to make their mark on the world. Rather, they illustrate and tell a whole series of stories that might never have been told before, told by someone who is expert in their corner of the world. Even though they might only get a few followers compared to Buzzfeed, they add a lot more to our understanding of the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. Each of the pieces that you are writing will need to contemplate a part of the net that might lead to its own distractions.</p>

<p>I am always impressed by people who have the ability to sit down and crank out clean copy that is ready for publication. It's not by any means easy to do this, and certainly every written work can be improved by judicious editing. I'm thinking more of the remarkable skill where you can type as fast as you can for a short burst and have the resulting words make sense, flow nicely, and be worth posting to the world.</p>

<p>The practice I get doing this has a lot to do with blogging, where I want to capture the moment and some momentarily interesting topic and put my mark on it. This is not writing a novel, and not writing a little piece of a 20-page or 400-page non-fiction work; rather, it's somewhere between journalism and blogging. The work you are composing is temporarily interesting to a number of people in part because it has a good headline for Twitter and a body full of words that search engines like. You've written news, but it's within the context of a blog, and because of that it's perfectly acceptable to leave questions unanswered and stories unresolved. It's what musician Michelle Shocked called the "incomplete image", and perhaps you are waiting for someone with a longer deadline to write up the full story.</p>

<p>I know from experience that I can put together 500 words in a sitting on one topic without taking a break and without needing to consult an outline. The much more challenging part is making a long, coherent single narrative out of these intermediate pieces parts. The skill of impromptu essay writing is by no means the same as the skill of book writing, and the task of challenging yourself to come up with a story that moves the current understanding a bit forward is a challenge. </p>

<p>To some degree, I'm willing to pad out those words with ample quotations from other sources, a sort of journalistic cut-and-paste that sifts through less well known sources to string together a story. (Of course the excerpts are carefully hyperlinked to avoid any suggestion of use without attribution.) Careful reuse of existing copy is one of the qualities that blogging can take advantage of that isn't generally OK in journalism circles. </p>

<p>If all you wrote were impromptu essays for the net, you'd quickly find out what was a keeper by the traffic you were able to draw in. On a good day, I'm happy to write three or four blog posts that either satisfy my own interest in preserving a bit of news or that advance some larger story or that answer a question that's on more than one person's mind right now. That would translate into 2000 words on a good day, and that doesn't sound like a lot. I think you'd have to work hard to keep the hopper full of article ideas and to keep up the research that fed a constant stream of ideas to work from, and to work doubly hard to collect the sort of essay-sized chunks that would eventually tell a story that's longer and more carefully planned.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">small wins and writing productivity</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small win is a concrete, complete outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of small wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals. A series of small wins is also more structurally sound than a large win because small wins are stable building blocks. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. When a solution is put into place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible. Additional resources flow toward winners, which means that slightly larger wins can be attempted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, rather than think about how hard it would be to produce a book of 80,000 words all in one sitting, it gets a lot easier to think how easy it would be to produce 400 words per day (on a topic of your choice naturally) for 200 days over the course of a year. I can bat out 100 words without thinking about it to answer an email message a dozen times a day. So capturing 80,000 words is simply a matter of doing that in some sensible order and not getting sidetracked by the need for everything to make 100% sense at the very beginning.</p>

<p>In addition, on 8 December 2013 there were several aftershocks, including a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/us/b000ldn6/us/index.html">magnitude 3.1 quake</a> just after midnight local time.</p>

<p>Reuters has a good overview of the Oklahoma earthquake situation in a November 11, 2013 article by Carey Gillam. Quakes are up sharply in recent years, and the ongoing concern is that they are related to the fracking (hydraulic fracturing) techniques used in the oil and gas industry. From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/19/us-usa-earthquakes-fracking-oklahoma-idUSBRE9AI12W20131119">Reuters</a>: "In Oklahoma, water, fracking - and a swarm of quakes"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seismologist Austin Holland wants to start an earthquake.</p>
  
  <p>From his office a few feet below the earth's surface - a basement at the University of Oklahoma in Norman - Holland, who tracks quakes for the Oklahoma Geological Survey, is digging into a complex riddle: Is a dramatic rise in the size and number of quakes in his state related to oil and gas production activity? And, if so, what can be done to stop it?</p>
  
  <p>As part of his wide-ranging research, Holland is proposing to inject pressurized water into porous rock in an area already known to be earthquake-prone, to see whether injections of oil industry wastewater are contributing to a "swarm" of earthquakes rocking the state.</p>

      <p>This is a quote from (of all places) the National Plant Diagnostic Network's <a href="http://www.npdn.org/infosec_confidentiality_privacy">handbook on email security</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Information leaks are also a problem with email. Emails are often forwarded beyond the original list of recipients — have you ever received an email from a friend with a confidentiality or copyright notice at the bottom? This is an attempt by your friend’s employer to make sure that confidential information does not get forwarded on to someone who is not supposed to see it. Unfortunately, it is so easy to send email that information spreads beyond what you intend, especially if the information is confidential, classified or newsworthy. Sending out confidential information of any kind in an email can be especially dangerous and costly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a rule, people do send out private and confidential information via email all the time. It's one of the risks we take when engaging in public discourse on a not-too-public mailing list, and it's one of the challenges of balancing convenience with safety. If you had to arrange a dead drop in person to convey information to everyone in your extended circle of friends it would get very tedious very fast.</p>

<p>The problem is particularly challenging when the information is not just confidential but also newsworthy. News tends to leak out (cf. Snowden) in ways that aren't always comfortable to those who have had their confidences betrayed. Even people who should know better - those public officials whose correspondence on official matters is subject to FOIA - protest vigorously when their email is made a matter of public record. Yet we continue on, using open wires and easy-to-forward messages to do our daily business.</p>

      <p>Saturday, 7 December 2013 - ANN ARBOR - It looks like the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">a2gov.org</a> web site is not functioning correctly.</p>

<p>The error behavior is strange, in that every valid page fetched yields a blank page, but if you go to a page that's not valid on the site you get a 404 error (and another blank page).</p>

<p>I don't know if a2gov.org email is also affected. </p>

<p>UPDATE: All systems appear to be functioning correctly again at 3:10p Saturday.</p>

<p>New on the board: Steve Powers</p>

<p>Media in the audience: Dave Askins, Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, WEMU; Ryan Stanton, Ann Arbor News.</p>

<p>Audience Participation</p>

<p>Main Street BIZ, Ellie Serras. January 28, coffee and pastries (9am, board meeting at 8am). BIZ not assessing December taxes; considering expanding boundaries of the current BIZ district. (No map provided of new district, and I don't know how quickly this might happen).</p>

<p>624 Church Street, Brad Moore. Asking DDA to modify terms of leasing spaces for payment in lieu of parking. Currently allocated 48 spaces for 15 years. Financing company wants to see 2 10-year extensions added to agreement to make spaces available to let leasing agreement exceed minimum of financing agreement (30 years financing).</p>

<p>Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council, Ray Detter. Holiday party. Commitment to the survival of the State Theater. Short history of theaters in Ann Arbor; refers to State Theater, Michigan Theater area as "Theater District". Owner of building is State Street Theater LLC.</p>

<p>Communications from DDA members.</p>

<p>Sandi Smith: new member introductions. Steve Powers, City Administrator. Cyndi Clark, Lily Grace Cosmetics / Lily Grace Spa.</p>

<p>Russ Collins: Michigan Theater board in communications with owners of State Theater building.</p>

<p>Minutes approved.</p>

<p>Motion to approve annual audit, which is done by Rehmann Robson, the same firm that does the City of Ann Arbor audit. Approved unanimously.</p>

<p>Motion to pay remainder of Main Street Light Pole Replacements, total of $280,000. Of which this is $120,000 from a State Street improvements fund left over from 10 years ago, $160,000 from 2015 TIF budget. Discussion of State Street improvements as well, need expressed by Susan Pollay to revisit light levels in that area. Noted by Russ Collins: Washington Street (south side) lights are off. Approved unanimously.</p>

<p>Old Y Lot: Substitute resolution re "Waive DDA Reimbursement", not included in board packet.  Substance: "The DDA hereby waives its interest in the net proceeds of $1,439,959 from the sale of the 350 S Fifth Avenue property." "The DDA strongly recommends that City Council follow the DDA's example to waive reimbursement to provide the maximum benefit for affordable housing in our community." Noted that the lot just about breaks even on parking revenues vs. interest payments; $1.4 million figure mostly reflects demolition costs of Old Y as well as the costs of creating the parking lot. Goal of DDA to put maximum set aside for affordable housing in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Goal/promise to rebuild 100 beds in downtown area has not happened. Russ Collins asks about strategic planning for use of these funds. Sandi Smith: current fund is nearly depleted.  Passes unanimously.</p>

<p>Interesting quote from previous discussion, here slightly but not much out of context: "We are told we are a shadow government" - Russ Collins.</p>

<p>New resolution, to address parking agreement brought up for 624 Church Street, not included in board packet. "The DDA recommends that the City extend the length of the parking contract for the 624 Church Street project with a term renewal of <em>_</em> years." Roger Hewitt reluctant to commit to a parking agreement for 30 years, perhaps past the length of the structure. Documents provided indicate that other developments have extended parking agreements, including Ashley Mews (20 yr), McKinley (20 yr), Village Green (20 yr + 4x5 yr extensions), Corner House Lofts (some perpetual, some 20 yr + negotiable renewal). </p>

<p>"Connector - Update". Video presented. 3 alternatives studied: bus rapid transit, streetcars, light rail. "Today buses are overcrowded so we can't just add more." Project 50% increase in auto trips in 20 years. http://aaconnector.com. 3 public meetings held in November, input on route options. Study needs to be completed in Q1 2014, "preferred local option" alternative provided in next few months. Two locations considered, one for central campus, one near Blake Transit Center. Federal funding depends on "savings in travel time". Cost as little as $100m, as much as $500m, about 1/2 from Federal funding (stand in line). Local match (50%) to include U of Michigan dollars. Don't expect anything rolling in less than 10 years. "Very long process."</p>

<p>"Bicycle Projects - Update". Keith Orr. Bike Share (B-Cycle). No specific requests to DDA, still looking at sites for 14 locations, goal to launch on Earth Day. Maynard Bike House largely a commuting option, not always the same people. So successful that already looking at other locations for bike houses. </p>

<p>GetDowntown - More rides, more participating organizations, more cards sold and used, continuing to be more popular. Nancy Shore point of contact.</p>

<p>NHL Winter Classic - parking. Planning. The Puck Drops Here for New Year's Eve. Parking strategy: NYE expecting everyone going home at the same time. Flat rate fee where there is congestion, 4/william and forest flat rate, don't have to stop at cashier booth. Consider for other facilities. New Year's Day: lot of reliance on buses. NHL asked to staff public garages to reserve parking space in advance, flagged in like Art Fair. "Ambassadors" to give you directions back to the garage. Specific map produced for the event. Republic Parking to provide labor. Charge for parking in structures and lots, $5 flat fee. Not meant to be an excessive amount. No projected numbers for parking demand is available. Urging mass transit as a way to get to and from the venue. Lawn parking will be allowed in the neighborhoods. Not likely to have as many locals as out of towners.</p>

<p>Downtown ambassador program. Roger Hewitt. "A number of views expressed." Most people thought it was a good idea, should "aggressively pursue it". Would like to see something in place for the summer. Learn from Grand Rapids experience. Not sure how much it's going to cost. </p>

<p>Chamber Impact conference report, report from Joan Lowenstein. Refer to prosperity, not unemployment. Michigan and Ann Arbor "lagging behind" Madison e.g. in attracting young professionals. Suggestions: transit, private sector growth, density. Attracting young professionals leads to attracting families (people settle down where they get their 1st job). "The nature of the media and social media you can get trashed just by putting yourself out in public."</p>

<p>Communication: Al McWilliams, Rishi Narayan. </p>

<p>2014 Calendar: propose to move 1/1 DDA meeting to 1/8, Partnerships move from 1/8 to 1/15. Otherwise calendar is the same. </p>

<p>Public comment: I talked about the need for pedestrian safety in the downtown area, based on observation that there's a density of car-pedestrian crashes downtown and on campus.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council's amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.</p>

      <p>Not just because we lost (though you can't fault the coach for trying to win rather than going for the tie). Nope, it was a big disappointment because the kids couldn't park any cars on the lawn. A good day would have meant $20 or $25 a car, but even for the Big Game there were still free spaces on the street.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Inbox zero just means that I have filled up the todo list. In this particular instance, my Gmail inbox is completely empty, and my todo list (kept in Github) has about 60 items on it, some of which have been on there for a year.</p>

<p>At some point you get to the state where there's one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things.</p>

<p>I find that my electronic record-keeping of things to do only goes so far, and from time to time I have to get away completely from electronica and sit down with pen and paper and write up the things that appear only on paper. It's like there's a separate queue for that stuff and the way to empty it out of my brain into a computer is via a paper intermediary. I wonder how many other environments that I could be in that would unearth new tasks.</p>

<p>I don't know yet what the correct high water and low water marks are on my issue list. Having 60 things to do seems like too few, and when I hit 100 a few months ago it seemed overwhelming. At 60 I figure I should be able to sit somewhere and brainstorm some goals that will take a while to accomplish (e.g. more durable than "do laundry") and stretch to reach something. </p>

<p>List-keeping is one of those dreadful refinements of modern life, where you have an extended amount of effort spent tracking what you're doing vs. actually doing it. Yet without somewhere to dump the list I would have no idea what I'm not doing right now.</p>

      <p>A preview of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting for Monday, December 2, 2013; based on the agenda printed on Friday, November 29, 2013 at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The hot issue for December 2, 2013 is the proposed repeal of the Ann Arbor pedestrian ordinance. If passed, city rules for pedestrians would revert to the Michigan state laws.</p>

<p>Another preview, with a lot more words, is at the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/12/01/dec-2-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>

<p>MC-1. Mayoral appointments and confirmations. Nothing controversial.</p>

<p>PH-2. An industrial development district at 1901 E Ellsworth, which would suit the needs of http://www.genze.com/ (Mahindra Genze), an electric scooter company.</p>

<p>PH-3. Running Fit wants to build upwards at 121-123 E Liberty and at 220 S Fourth.</p>

<p>PH-1. Repeal of the pedestrian ordinance, a public hearing. Expect a lot of speakers. Reorganized on the agenda to go third, not first. (39 speakers, 36 against)</p>

<p>CA-1. Approve a $58,000 annual maintenance license for ESRI GIS software.</p>

<p>B-1. Repeal of the pedestrian ordinance, second reading. There are 5 sponsors for the ordinance, and it's expected to be repealed; but there may be last-minute negotiations that lead to some kind of compromise.</p>

<p>C-1. Traverwood Apartments rezoning, first reading.</p>

<p>DC-1. Council calendar for 2014.</p>

<p>DC-2. Policy for removal of street parking spaces; it's proposed that a street parking space be valued at $45,000.</p>

<p>DB-1. Running Fit wants to build upwards at 121-123 E Liberty and at 220 S Fourth.</p>

Fifth Avenue ($3,500,000.00) (8 Votes Required) (Roll Call Vote Required)"  This is a surprise. "Whereas, it is in the best interest of the City to extend the maturity date of the Agreement by six months."  The Bank of Ann Arbor is extending the same terms and interest rate as currently held, with no prepayment penalty.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://a2docs.org/doc/326/">These documents (in CSV and Excel format) provide a list of restaurants in Washtenaw County that were inspected in October 2013, as well as a count of violations</a>. Also accompanying this data is a press release from the county describing how to interpret the data. I've put copies on a2docs.</p>

<p>This was prompted in part by the latest <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/restaurant_inspections_for_was_1.html">Ann Arbor News</a> publication of this data, which did not have the whole list visible or sortable in any useful way.</p>

<p>A version of the list is embedded here in a Google Spreadsheet. I've sorted it by the count of "priority" violations, which is definitely not the only way to sort it. If you're looking for raw data, the a2docs files are sufficiently detailed that you can draw your own conclusions, make your own maps, etc.</p>

<p>These are only raw counts, and it's worth noting this sentence from the press release: "Priority and Priority Foundation Violations must be corrected immediately at the time of inspection or within 10 days."</p>

<p>You can see detailed reports on the <a href="http://www.swordsolutions.com/inspections/pgesearchresults.asp?County=28">Sword Systems website</a> which hosts county inspection data for a number of counties throughout the state. Alas, there's no way to link deep into this database to connect a given restaurant to its inspection, and no way to run a query like "who has mice in their kitchen". </p>

      </h3>
      <p>We had a good time and a lively discussion at the 3d Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup. There were about 18 people in attendance, including the City of Ann Arbor CFO/CIO, the webmaster from Washtenaw County, several U of Michigan SI students, some townies, a fellow who drove down from Lansing who had organized Code Michigan hackathon, and a number of folks who were drawn in from Meetup. (who did I miss)</p>

<p>After everyone introduced themselves we did a few rounds of discussion of the projects that people were working on with public data as well as some talk about data that wasn't available in easy formats. Projects included</p>

<ul>
<li>the detailed data from the 1,4 Dioxane plume that is spreading under Ann Arbor</li>
<li>traffic crash facts and accident reports to inform pedestrian safety discussions</li>
<li>estimating rental property utility costs from crowdsourced data</li>
<li>liberating restaurant inspections from proprietary databases</li>
<li>data about dangerous buildings and nuisance properties</li>
<li>adopt-a-storm-drain</li>
<li>report from a "data dive" that looked at non-profit data in a hackathon</li>
<li>(what did I miss)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these projects were actively in development (several were "gee wouldn't be nice if") and there was not one single effort that everyone focused on. Instead it was a healthy back and forth about a lot of possible directions.</p>

<p>We started at 7p and ended at 830p, and people stayed around talking until 9p. I'm happy with the turnout and with the people who showed up, and am hopeful that the next meeting (in January) will be as well received. We had an offer to host it in a Washtenaw County facility for the next event.</p>
