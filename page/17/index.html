<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>A preview of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting for Monday, December 2, 2013; based on the agenda printed on Friday, November 29, 2013 at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The hot issue for December 2, 2013 is the proposed repeal of the Ann Arbor pedestrian ordinance. If passed, city rules for pedestrians would revert to the Michigan state laws.</p>

<p>Another preview, with a lot more words, is at the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/12/01/dec-2-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>

<p>INT-1. We have new firefighters, let's meet them.</p>

<p>INT-2. A review of Fiscal Year 2013 audit results from CFO Tom Crawford.</p>

<p>INT-3. Philip Deletka is volunteer of the month for work on the CERT program. (Added late.)</p>

<p>Public commentary reserved time! 10 speakers at 3 minutes each. Speakers: Tom Partridge, Henry Herskovitz.</p>

<p>CC-1. Here's who's on various council committees.</p>

<p>Briere to Planning Commission. (added late)</p>

<p>Taylor to Greenbelt Advisory Commission.  (added late)</p>

<p>Briere and Anglin to the Environmental Commission.  (added late)</p>

<p>Council rep TBD to Disabilities Commission.  (added late)</p>

<p>Someone to LDFA (added late, not reflected in electronic agenda).</p>

<p>CC-2. Council rules.</p>

<p>MC-1. Mayoral appointments and confirmations. Nothing controversial.</p>

<p>PH-2. An industrial development district at 1901 E Ellsworth, which would suit the needs of http://www.genze.com/ (Mahindra Genze), an electric scooter company.</p>

<p>PH-3. Running Fit wants to build upwards at 121-123 E Liberty and at 220 S Fourth.</p>

<p>PH-1. Repeal of the pedestrian ordinance, a public hearing. Expect a lot of speakers. Reorganized on the agenda to go third, not first. (39 speakers, 36 against)</p>

<p>A-1. Approve last month's minutes for council.</p>

<p>CA-1. Approve a $58,000 annual maintenance license for ESRI GIS software.</p>

<p>B-1. Repeal of the pedestrian ordinance, second reading. There are 5 sponsors for the ordinance, and it's expected to be repealed; but there may be last-minute negotiations that lead to some kind of compromise.</p>

<p>C-1. Traverwood Apartments rezoning, first reading.</p>

<p>DC-1. Council calendar for 2014.</p>

<p>DC-2. Policy for removal of street parking spaces; it's proposed that a street parking space be valued at $45,000.</p>

<p>DB-1. Running Fit wants to build upwards at 121-123 E Liberty and at 220 S Fourth.</p>

<p>DB-2. Donation of 2.2 acres from Bill Martin adjacent to the Traverwood Apartments proposed development.</p>

<p>DS-1, DS-2. Asbestos abatement in floors 3, 4, and 5 of City Hall.</p>

<p>DS-3. An industrial development district at 1901 E Ellsworth, see PH-2.</p>

<p>DS-4. City-University parking ticket processing contract.</p>

<p>DS-5. "Resolution to Approve a Six Month Extension of the Existing Installment Purchase Agreement with Bank of Ann Arbor to Finance the Purchase of 350 S. Fifth Avenue ($3,500,000.00) (8 Votes Required) (Roll Call Vote Required)"  This is a surprise. "Whereas, it is in the best interest of the City to extend the maturity date of the Agreement by six months."  The Bank of Ann Arbor is extending the same terms and interest rate as currently held, with no prepayment penalty.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://a2docs.org/doc/326/">These documents (in CSV and Excel format) provide a list of restaurants in Washtenaw County that were inspected in October 2013, as well as a count of violations</a>. Also accompanying this data is a press release from the county describing how to interpret the data. I've put copies on a2docs.</p>

<p>This was prompted in part by the latest <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/restaurant_inspections_for_was_1.html">Ann Arbor News</a> publication of this data, which did not have the whole list visible or sortable in any useful way.</p>

<p>A version of the list is embedded here in a Google Spreadsheet. I've sorted it by the count of "priority" violations, which is definitely not the only way to sort it. If you're looking for raw data, the a2docs files are sufficiently detailed that you can draw your own conclusions, make your own maps, etc.</p>

<p>These are only raw counts, and it's worth noting this sentence from the press release: "Priority and Priority Foundation Violations must be corrected immediately at the time of inspection or within 10 days."</p>

<p>You can see detailed reports on the <a href="http://www.swordsolutions.com/inspections/pgesearchresults.asp?County=28">Sword Systems website</a> which hosts county inspection data for a number of counties throughout the state. Alas, there's no way to link deep into this database to connect a given restaurant to its inspection, and no way to run a query like "who has mice in their kitchen". </p>

      </h3>
      <p>We had a good time and a lively discussion at the 3d Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup. There were about 18 people in attendance, including the City of Ann Arbor CFO/CIO, the webmaster from Washtenaw County, several U of Michigan SI students, some townies, a fellow who drove down from Lansing who had organized Code Michigan hackathon, and a number of folks who were drawn in from Meetup. (who did I miss)</p>

<p>After everyone introduced themselves we did a few rounds of discussion of the projects that people were working on with public data as well as some talk about data that wasn't available in easy formats. Projects included</p>

<ul>
<li>the detailed data from the 1,4 Dioxane plume that is spreading under Ann Arbor</li>
<li>traffic crash facts and accident reports to inform pedestrian safety discussions</li>
<li>estimating rental property utility costs from crowdsourced data</li>
<li>liberating restaurant inspections from proprietary databases</li>
<li>data about dangerous buildings and nuisance properties</li>
<li>adopt-a-storm-drain</li>
<li>report from a "data dive" that looked at non-profit data in a hackathon</li>
<li>(what did I miss)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these projects were actively in development (several were "gee wouldn't be nice if") and there was not one single effort that everyone focused on. Instead it was a healthy back and forth about a lot of possible directions.</p>

<p>We started at 7p and ended at 830p, and people stayed around talking until 9p. I'm happy with the turnout and with the people who showed up, and am hopeful that the next meeting (in January) will be as well received. We had an offer to host it in a Washtenaw County facility for the next event.</p>

      <p>This letter went out Friday night, but there was no discussion or announcement on the a2schools.org official school website as late as early Monday morning. I first saw the full text of this letter on the excellent <a href="http://a2schoolsmuse.blogspot.com/2013/11/principal-principles-perspectives-and.html">Ann Arbor Schools Musings</a> weblog where there's a good discussion.</p>

<pre>
Dear Pioneer Families,

I have notified the Pioneer community today that Ms. Cindy Leaman has agreed
to serve as Principal of Ann Arbor's A2 Virtual+ Academy beginning 
January 6, 2014.

Ms. Tamber Woodworth will serve as Principal for the remainder of the 
school year. Ms. Woodworth has agreed to return to Pioneer where 
she served previously as both a class principal and principal prior 
to her retirement.

I know we will all work together to support our students at Pioneer.

Thank you,

Jeanice Swift

Superintendent.

      </h3>
      <p>From the <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home">CHIRP web site</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio's programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com">Radio Reference</a> and <a href="http://www.repeaterbook.com/">RepeaterBook</a> to find the channels you want to have easy access to. Programming the device should just be a matter of loading in the set you want, attaching your radio to your computer via a programming cable, and selecting "Upload to Radio".</p>

<p>My new radio is on its way, so I'll update this when I get it to work! So far the application was easy to install (you have to install a Python runtime on OS X before it works) and it was easy to get the Washtenaw county repeater list from <a href="http://www.repeaterbook.com/">RepeaterBook</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATED: It worked the first time! Here's what I had to do to make it go smoothly.</p>

<p>First, before you upload channels to your radio, you have to download its current configuration. This gets all of the settings out of the system.</p>

<p>Second, after you are done uploading the channels, unplug the programming cable from the radio. This should be obvious? but somehow it wasn't. Once I unplugged things everything worked just fine.</p>

<p>Third, make sure that you pick the right radio that you are connecting to or else unpredictable things can happen.</p>

<p>I found the walk-through at <a href="http://www.miklor.com/COM/UV_CHIRP.php">Miklor's CHIRP Software Guide</a> to be useful and helpful, and it suggested some additional features (like setting channels to be receive-only) that will probably get me to re-program the radio a few times before I'm done.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months, even though the Dread Pirate Roberts was taken offline. A recent graph shows the currency trading above $800.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-11-24 at 3.19.37 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-11-24 at 3.19.37 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>What has changed that would drive the price from $140 to $800? The only simple answer (right or wrong) is China. The <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1364040/value-virtual-currency-bitcoin-skyrockets">South China Morning Post</a> reports -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A US Senate hearing put bitcoin firmly in the mainstream and triggered fresh support from countries that tend to fall in line with America's financial regulatory regime.</p>
  
  <p>In the past 30 days, the price of a single bitcoin has quadrupled, with Chinese speculators among the most enthusiastic buyers.</p>
  
  <p>The question now is whether bitcoin can fulfill the goal it was conceived for: a fast, cheap online payment method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20131122000032&amp;cid=1202">Want China Times</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bitcoin has become the world's most heated investment target over the past week, appreciating by US$100 daily on average due to widespread speculation, the Shanghai-based China Business News reports.</p>
  
  <p>On Tuesday, on China's biggest bitcoin platform, <a href="https://vip.btcchina.com/">BTC China</a>, one bitcoin could be exchanged for more than 6,000 yuan (US$984.57), an intraday high, with the day's average at 5,888 yuan (US$966.04), up sharply from 3,226 yuan (US$529.29) a day earlier. BTC China just recently surpassed Tokyo-based Mt.Gox to become the world's largest bitcoin trading platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BTC China wisely warns</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important Bitcoin trading can be considered a high-risk activity, where Bitcoin prices are volatile, and can swing wildly, from day to day. Please use your extreme judgement when making the decision to invest in, or to sell, Bitcoins. BTC China is not soliciting for users to buy or sell Bitcoins, as an investment, or for profit. All Bitcoin trading decisions should be made independently by the user.</p>

      <p>I'm using Github as a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">personal issue tracker</a>, still using it in fact for a whole year. It says that I've crossed 1200+ things off my todo lists and still have 70+ left to go. Unlike "inbox zero", I'm resigned to the notion that my todo list will hover somewhere between 60 and 90 things to do at any time.</p>

<p><a href="http://octodroid.com/">Octodroid</a> is a Github client for Android. It provides access to a bunch of Github features, most notably the issues feature. I can sort through issues, scroll through them, add comments and mark them as closed. It's free (free is good) though there hasn't been an update to the software in the better part of a year.</p>

<p>There are other fancier todo lists in the world, but very few of them come with a complete source code control system and a serviceable wiki. My only complaint with any of the Android tools for Github that I've found so far is that none of them are really good wiki editors. I sometimes miss how good Evernote is at providing a simple synchronized text editor, and wish that it had more wiki-nature. Octodroid is just good enough at tracking what I'm doing and not doing to satisfy the need to have a todo list that goes with me everywhere that doesn't live in my inbox.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>"An Open Letter to President Coleman and Provost Pollack", published on <a href="http://um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/">um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/</a> - from the lead paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, the undersigned faculty of the University of Michigan, support your intent to realign administrative expenses relative to revenues. However we collectively reject the proposed Administrative Services Transformation (AST) project. We respectfully offer an alternative approach to AST, which we call Unit- Centric Services (UCS). We believe that the AST approach is inherently flawed because its focus is on reducing administrative costs without taking into account the concurrent reduction in faculty and staff productivity, collaborative academic culture, and the unique needs of heterogeneous academic units. In contrast, UCS's focus is on productivity and intra-unit efficiencies. Higher productivity translates into higher revenues relative to expenses, even though expenses may, but do not need to, be higher. The unique cultures and modes of operation of different units are facilitated by staff that retain corporate knowledge of local processes. Conversely, AST is a top-down program that eliminates the ability to retain corporate knowledge and leverage the unit-culture experiences of some 300 support staff while limiting their contributions to a series of transactional tasks in a call center. The inevitable result is to tax the faculty with numerous clerical tasks, thereby reducing their accessibility to students and their productivity as scholars and researchers. In contrast, the premise of UCS is to develop a strategic plan aimed at improving productivity at the unit level (school/college and/or department), with plans developed with full participation by the faculty, staff and administrators in that unit, and in tune with the particular academic culture and practices of that unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of this writing, the document is signed by 594 faculty members.</p>

<p>Clearly, one of the things that the University would need to centralize to avoid public displays of dissent is the control of web sites and the domain name system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nineteen department chairs in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts -- the largest college on campus -- wrote a Nov. 1 letter to senior administrators protesting an “air of secrecy” around the effort and raising concerns that longtime staffers, particularly lower-income women, would be hurt by the changes, either because of layoffs or pay cuts.
  In response, senior Michigan officials wrote a Nov. 14 letter acknowledging they were “not sensitive or consultative enough in the planning and communication of this initiative.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b017e59cb970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b017e59cb970b" alt="A2b3" title="A2b3" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b017e59cb970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>I used to organize lunch every Thursday at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. Then the restaurant closed, and my A2B3 lunch group was set adrift. Here's what we've been up to.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">email list</a> that goes with the group has been steady even with the disruption in the lunch routine. There's a steady stream of questions with answers, job postings, news about events and the like. List membership is in the 450 range, and a relatively typical month has about 90 messages. The list has been going since August 2005 and occasionally gets written up in print (an Ann Arbor Observer mention was most recent).</p>

<p>I've added a <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">meetup group</a> to help actually plan actual events, since it's pretty good about nagging people without me having to nag people, and it's handy to have RSVPs.</p>

<p>Since there is an effective way to switch locations, we've started to rotate events more. In recent week's we've visited Bell's Diner on W Stadium and Be Won on Green Road for lunch, and in both cases had 10 or more people out for lunch. This actually poses a problem at most restaurants - Bell's seats 8 comfortably with a little planning but 13 was a stretch. At Be Won we seated 6 and then sent 4 next door to Zamaan Cafe for what was apparently delicious middle eastern food (I mean to try it next time I'm up there).</p>

<p>The staple routine, which seems to be about every other week, is to go to Madras Masala on Maynard Street for a lunch buffet ($11 includes tip). We can always handle 8 there without any planning, and if ever we got so many RSVPs that we needed to plan for more they've been very accomodating. The food is good though some people don't like how spicy it is, and parking at the neighboring Maynard St structure is close unless of course you have a truck in which case it's kind of dicey.</p>

<p>What I love about organizing lunch for 450 (of whom 8 show up on a typical week) is just how much of the Ann Arbor community I've had lunch with. Since 2005, I'll estimate conservatively that I've had lunch with 4500 people (9 years * 50 weeks * 10 people average). That number is probably low because at the depths of the recession we were seeing 25 or 30 people at a time who had a lunch hour free. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">Former Ann Arbor Public Schools principal accused of plagiarism</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. How many different very short birthday greetings can you send?</p>

<p>That said, educators are usually held to higher standards of writing than their students, and writing is expected to be something that they are good enough at that they don't need to crib from someone else's words.</p>

<p>With that as a preface, here's someone else's words about someone else using someone else's words, in this case a former AAPS principal (Sulura Jackson) who is now in Chapel Hill, NC. The reporting is from <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/chapel-hill-high-school-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/Content?oid=3770001">Indy Week</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What they found is startling: Multiple documents obtained by the INDY that show Jackson—before and after her arrival at Chapel Hill High—lifted entire passages and letters from books, online articles and teaching resource guides. She used those passages without citation in staff memos, letters to students and even recommendation letters for colleagues, frequently passing them off as her words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the world of education is full of web sites that are full of reusable forms and letters for communicating with students and teachers, like this <a href="http://www.educationworld.com/tools_templates/index.shtml">Education World</a> page</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Communicate with parents by snail mail or e-mail with these editable and/or printable forms and letters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the business world in general, with this set of <a href="http://www.4hb.com/letters/index.html">662 business letters</a> - catchy titles like "Apology to receiver of NSF check" -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I received your letter of (date) with my check
  attached marked "insufficient funds", I called my bank
  immediately.</p>
  
  <p>The gentleman I spoke with, (name) , discovered
  that the bank had failed to credit my account with a
  substantial deposit I had made several days prior.</p>
  
  <p>The bank has assured me that they will be sending you a
  formal letter of apology for their error. Attached is my
  check in the amount of $ to replace the dishonored
  one you have returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communications from authorities are often ritualistic, formulaic, and repetitious. Hopefully, though, they are not careless. Jackson was tripped up by this mistake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking back, the alleged plagiarism might have gone unnoticed were it not for one careless sentence the Chapel Hill High School principal wrote in an October condolence letter to a teacher.</p>
  
  <p>"Everyone at Skyline is saddened to learn of the death of your mother," the letter said.</p>
  
  <p>It seemed Sulura Jackson, who arrived in Chapel Hill this summer with a sparkling, lengthy résumé, had failed to remove the name of her former school, Skyline High, in Ann Arbor, Mich., from the text.</p>
  
  <p>Teachers who spoke to the INDY on the condition that their names not be used for fear of retribution say the incident prompted them to dig deeper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're going to use a form letter, for goodness sake read the whole form and fill in all the blanks before sending it !</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/triangulator/archives/2013/11/21/whats-next-for-chhs-principal-accused-of-plagiarism">Again from Indy Week</a>: "More evidence of Chapel Hill High plagiarism?"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Members of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools Board of Education were already scheduled to meet tonight at the Lincoln Center in Chapel Hill. The board's agenda says members will discuss a personnel matter in closed session starting at 6 p.m. The public portion of the meeting begins at 7 p.m.</p>

      <p>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.</p>

<p>What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that's visibly not the only issue at hand.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.</p>

<p>From various sources including email and twitter; this is surely incomplete.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight's Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled. Bryant Elementary now closed in Ann Arbor due to power outage-caused heating failure. Students that arrived at school sent back home.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor District Library: "The power is out at Malletts Creek Branch, it is currently closed. All other @aadl locations will open at 10 AM. Stay tuned for updates!"</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township offices are closed.</p>

<p>14-B District Court is closed.</p>

<p>Eastern Michigan University: Rec/IM: Due to technical problems, the Jones Pool will be closed until further notice. We apologize for the inconvenience. (via @EMU_Swoop)</p>

<p>Chelsea Police say power is still out and is expected to be out for "the next several hours," as of 8:15 a.m. Chelsea schools have also been closed. (Heritage News) Chelsea Center for the Arts will be closed today, Monday, November 18, 2013 due to a citywide power outage.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c img-responsive" alt="Aael-cvga-300x225" title="Aael-cvga-300x225" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I went with S and J to the <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive</a> (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman">David S. Carter</a> (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. An annual collection budget of about $13,000 buys new games and the occasional old console from eBay. The archive has a near complete collection of US consoles, and Dave said they are looking to expand their international coverage. One of their latest acquisitions was a DVD system that plays only one title. The archive would like to improve its collection of handheld games.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of the next five years is with digital rights management (DRM). The DRM systems envisioned would lock a game to a particular piece of console hardware, making it impossible to have used games and very hard for a library to add a title to a collection. For network-delivered games like Steam it's equally hard for the library to spend $10 on a license, when licenses negotiated by libraries for things like electronic versions of journals are usually for much more.</p>

<p>Dave said the archive was pretty much where they want to be after 5 years. He knew they were on the right track when they got space in the library even before they had a budget. The challenge of next five years is less collection building and more about building connections across campus and around the world to other research collections. He compared the collection to early film and video collections, now standard at all research libraries, but once considered a novelty.</p>

<p>Other comparable collections are at the <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/videogamearchive/index.php">University of Texas at Austin</a> and at <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/03/stanford-libraries-preserves-historical-software-collection-federal-agency">Stanford</a>. Public libraries so not tend to have research collections, preferring to  either use video games strictly for events or to have a circulating collection where you check out current games like any other video or music media.</p>

<p>I asked Dave about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware">Internet Archive's online gaming collection</a>, and especially about the role of emulation in preserving games. He told me that emulation does not preserve original game play, especially the ergonomics of controllers. Playing on original game hardware with original video hardware gives you an accurate rendition of original game play experience. (Besides, you can't play <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005840579">Duck Hunt</a> without an old fashioned TV because the game depends on sensing the scan lines on the TV.) Some old games are very hard to enjoy on original hardware and the limitations of the controls, not the game itself, are what trips up your enjoyment.</p>

      <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Tasty_Green_Cafe">Tasty Green Cafe</a> inside Ann Arbor City Hall.

There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment).</p>

<p>Lunch (a meat pie and a coke) was $5.01. </p>

<p>I talked briefly with City Attorney <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Stephen_Postema">Stephen Postema</a> and his thoughts on proposed FOIA legislation coming from Lansing (he's skeptical).

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222614&amp;GUID=3890EFBC-18C0-4B89-A44B-B72A3143DAD5&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting agenda</a> for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.</p>

<p>As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/13/nov-18-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a>. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/repeal_of_ann_arbors_controver.html">Ann Arbor News story</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.m. it's not on the agenda, but Ann Arbor News reporter Ryan Stanton suggests on twitter that the disposition of the Old Y Lot may make it onto the agenda tonight, with council asked to accept the Dahlmann bid. 5:05 p.m. Now on the PDF agenda as "DC-4 13-1467 Resolution to Approve Sale of City-Owned Property at 350 S. Fifth to Dennis A. Dahlmann (8 Votes Required)".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Word is that Dennis Dahlmann has accepted all of the city&#39;s terms and Y Lot sales agreement could be voted on tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=hash">#a2council</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Stanton (@ryanjstanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton/statuses/402543766415757312">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This will be the first meeting for new City Council member Jack Eaton, who defeated Twenty Pound Carp in the general election in November 2013.</p>

<p>Council will appoint a Mayor Pro Tem, to serve as acting Mayor when there is no mayor available. Traditionally this has gone to the most senior member of council by tenure, and I think that might be Margie Teall; the Chronicle hints that Jane Lumm might have the nod.</p>

<p>MC-1 Mayoral appointments look uncontroversial.</p>

<p>PH-1, B-1 "Pizza in the park", a waiver of fees for parks activities that provide basic human services, looks like it's likely to pass based on last week's discussion.</p>

<p>PH-2, B-2 "DDA Revisions" is probably going to take a long time, as various members of council try to make political points regarding the relative balance of services between the downtown and the neighborhoods. Make popcorn.</p>

<p>CA-1 "The Puck Drops Here" is a 31 December 2013 event (details?) to be held just before the 1 January 2014 Winter Classic NHL hockey game.</p>

<p>CA-2 "Hockey is just like football" as far as parking restrictions and street closings goes.</p>

<p>CA-3 Dawn Farm has agreed to acquire 618 N. Main from Avalon Housing.</p>

<p>DC-1 "Ypsi Township on AAATA board" Council gets to decide whether Ypsilanti Township has a seat on the AAATA transit authority board. It was a matter of controversy when it came up the first time; keep up with the popcorn.</p>

<p>DC-4 "Dahlmann proposal for Old Y Lot" This showed up on the agenda at the last possible moment, to the point where it's not clear that members of council will get a chance to read it before voting on it; certainly no one had a chance to put their name in for public commentary on this item. I'm hopeful that this resolution will be postponed until next time for a vote.</p>

<p>DS-2, DS-3, DS-4 Easement swaps with the University of Michigan for a new conduit through the Arboretum, and a new survey to settle a disputed boundary between the city and the university. </p>

<p>G-1. The Greenbelt Advisory Commission has minutes to approve from 2011 (!!!).</p>

<p>G-2. The Public Art Commission has minutes to approve from January and Feburary 2012 (!!!)</p>

<p>G-6, G-7, G-8, G-9 The Taxicab board has been very slow to produce minutes; these date back to January 2013.</p>

<p>Not on the agenda yet is a possible purchase agreement for the "Old Y Lot".</p>
