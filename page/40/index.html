<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>My phone is either nearing the end of its useful life, or reaching the start of some new useful life; I'm not sure which.</p>

<p>Its one true calling is as a terminal for Twitter, and that task it does admirably. Everything else is marginal or slow at best. But Twitter and a fast keyboard makes up for all of that.</p>

<p>The phone in question is a Blackberry Pearl with one of those squooshed keyboards that makes typing an adventure but also lets the phone fit into very small places. I loathe the idea of getting an Android phone without a good keyboard, and an iPhone is just not appealing for the price. I don't need another Blackberry because, hey, I have my Twitterphone!</p>

<p>When all you have is a Twitterphone, every problem looks like Twitter. Need to search for a restaurant, report a problem with squeaky brakes, look for a weather report, pretty much anything - Twitter. And to the extent that your world is Twitter shaped, that's a reasonable excuse for a device to carry with you everywhere.</p>

<p>I am sure that if I got some other device, that some other strong point of it would come to the fore. I'm sure there's a perfect phone for Facebook, a ideal device for LinkedIn, a super handset for your employer's Android application. The question of search for "which device do I want" becomes impossible because you know that you will adapt to whatever you have rather than discarding it, to some extreme extent of making or losing friends because of what you hold in your hand.</p>

      <p>Tasks to take on at the end of filling up a paper notebook.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read through the whole thing, copying out the good parts. There are bound to be enough good parts that you want to save and remember some of them, and scanning them in is one way to preserve the rough qualities. Retyping a clean copy with additional notes inspired by the original is another way to manage that same task.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider shredding the bad parts. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/vacuum-0.html">Forgetting is as important as remembering</a>, and you can channel <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/03/note-to-self-15.html">15 minutes of Discardia</a> by getting rid of junk that is just taking up space. Of course this is a horror if it's a true laboratory notebook, but I'm not going to make that assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile an index of names. Figuring out who you were thinking of along the way is at least as interesting to methodically review as what you were thinking about, since the review process may be as simple as reconnecting with someone who sparked a great idea but with whom you haven't had that conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a suitable visual design for a new notebook. Figure out how to be inspired by the blank page again, and use a design that matches something that causes you to start the page full of ideas. A blank page can be more constraining than one that has some structure already filled in, and a great page layout can be inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what it is that you will be carrying with you every day. The only way to fill a notebook is to have it handy. Don't allow it to go unused simply because it isn't there, or because you don't have a pen or pencil always within reach.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>notes.</p>

<p>The original of this was 5 short lines, and it got longer in the process of writing for the net. It also made me want to discard things in order to leave room for more conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract—Frequency dynamics is one of the most important measures of an electrical power system status. To better understand power system dynamics, an accurately measured wide-area frequency is needed. The concept of building an Internet-based real-time GPS-synchronized wide-area frequency monitoring network (FNET) was proposed in 2000 by Qiu et al., and this concept has been realized. The FNET system consists of frequency disturbance recorders and an information management system. The FNET has made the synchronized observations of the entire U.S. power network possible with very little cost for the ﬁrst time. This paper summarizes the implementation of the FNET system and shows some preliminary observations and analyses of the data that have been collected from the FNET.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR (December 5, 2011): There are a number of neighborhoods in Ann Arbor where there are citizens who receive newspapers, and "newspaper-like items", where the citizen does not pay for the newspaper.  We receive a free copy of the <a href="http://heritage.com/ann_arbor_journal/">Ann Arbor Journal</a>, and there are some neighborhoods where a number of students receive the <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> gratis.</p>

<p>Alas, not everyone who gets a free paper opens it up in time for it to be useful, and some of it turns into litter. Some of that litter is neighborhoods where people like to keep the streets tidy.</p>

<p>The Ann Arbor City Council is considering an anti-newspaper law, file <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1012148&amp;GUID=1523FCC1-2D7A-4D17-A493-82D6F2DE50F9&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">11-1470</a>, which would amend the city code regarding distribution of handbills. The document with proposed changes as of the November 21, 2011 meeting is on the Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository as <a href="http://a2docs.org/doc/303/">document 303</a>. The ordinance in this form was not voted on. The ordinance was again put in front of council on December 5, 2011, and then tabled.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> reported on the agenda item on the nights of the council meeting. Under the headline <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/11/21/ann-arbor-no-newspaper-law-delayed/">Ann Arbor: “No Newspaper” Law Delayed</a>, it wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The council postponed the ordinance revision to its next meeting, on Dec. 5, because the content of the proposed revision had not been disseminated to the public in a timely way before the meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the night of December 5, the Chronicle's article on <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/12/06/ann-arbor-tables-no-newspaper-law/">Ann Arbor Tables “No Newspaper” Law</a> cited three recent cases on unwanted delivery of newspapers, including City of Fresno v Press Communications (1994), Rowan v US Post Office (1970), and Tillman v Distribution Systems of America (1996).</p>

<p>When similar legislation went into place in Chicago, a blogger referred to this as a <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/huston/071020">free newspaper killing law</a>, and some amount of righteous pro-litter indignation noted that the founding fathers were in favor of free speech and newspapers.  The countervailing view from Baltimore refers to the free Thursday SunPlus newspaper as <a href="http://www.examiner.com/politics-in-baltimore/the-litter-problem-caused-by-the-thursday-sunplus-paper">littering and dumping</a>.</p>

      <p>Every so often my world gets influenced by the colors of things that I see, and I find the need to sort by color.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#39;m sorting a lot of web tabs by the color of the favicon, left to right in a rainbow, with <span style="background-color: #ffc0c0;">Gmail</span> (red) on the left and <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Google Calendar</span> (blue) on the right. Surprisingly few violet and indigo favicons, or else they would take the rightmost tabstop; I suspect that if I used <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Yahoo</span> more, I&#39;d sort the other way.</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing this in <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">Typepad</span> (pale green, somewhere in the middle), and I notice right away that Markdown, the editor it had inside, doesn&#39;t have a color picker for text.</p>
<p>The programmers I work with use color-coded text all the time as part of their way to notice structural and syntax elements, but I think I&#39;d be really confused by that all the time - I&#39;m much more after semantic coloring than syntactic coloring. I also know that this kind of <span style="background-color: #ffff80;"><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/assisted-synesthesia-as-augmented-reality.html" target="_self">machine-assisted synaesthesia</a></span>&#0160;is an acquired taste&#0160;for me that comes and goes and doesn&#39;t seem yet to have consistent colors.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/LBPNA">Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association</a> that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the <a href="http://annarborbridges.org">Stadium Bridges project</a> are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.</p>

<p>The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/fig6f_05_longdesc.htm">M4-9b</a>. But instead of being aligned as a pedestrian sign, it's pointed along the path that cars will see. We're hoping this won't cause cars to go the wrong way down a one way street, thinking that the pedestrian detour is the automobile detour. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ericscheie.com/">Eric Scheie</a> for the night time photo of pedestrian detour signage in the Lower Burns Park neighborhood. </p>

<p>Riots is of course a loaded word, but that's what the media and public safety is using. Some stories about this evening's firing of long-time Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, and Penn State president Graham Spanier, and the sometimes violent reaction on the Happy Valley campus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Jon) Wertheim: This university lost their president today. What Jerry Sandusky is to alleged to have done is some of the most grotesque stuff you'll ever read, but it seems to be all about Joe Paterno tonight. It's just interesting to see a new wave of emotion here. It's anger, and it's frustration, and I imagine tomorrow's going to be completely different. This story keeps jumping around.</p>

  <p>Crowds began to gather around 10 p.m. on Beaver Avenue. After police in riot gear told them to move along, the students moved to Old Main. They sang the alma mater, professed their love for Paterno and profanely denounced Sandusky. They pointed toward Penn State president Graham Spanier's still-lit office. Then, after a brief "back to Beaver" chant, the crowd returned to Beaver Avenue. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year.

      <p>ANN ARBOR USA, November 5-7, 2011 (Vacuum News) - There were a series of earthquakes in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, but we didn't feel them here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p>Some maps and news from people who did feel the quakes follow. The data here are preliminary, and you'll want to go to the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usb0006klz.php">USGS page for the Oklahoma quake</a> for details, and <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/history.php">Oklahoma earthquake history</a> to figure out how normal this is. The <a href="http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov/">Oklahoma Geological Survey</a> is likely to also have excellent data. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/oklahoma-earthquake-sets-a-record.html">News coverage from the New York Times</a> quotes Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey; Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center; and Justin Reese, who runs the <a href="http://boomarangdiner.com/">Boomarang Diner</a> in Chandler, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The earthquake, originally reported at magnitude 5.2 and then upgraded to 5.6, was said to be felt [as far away as Milwaukee] - a claim which is being tested and that I haven't confirmed. <a href="http://earthquakes.tafoni.net/">Additional aftershocks were reported</a>; the map is by <a href="http://www.tafoni.net/">Dawn Endico</a> using the Google Maps API. Earthquake data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey on Mon, 07 Nov 2011 01:14:04 GMT.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?</p>

<p>There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. The VC in turn provides value by vetting the value of the allegedly valuable trade secret and is prepared to say "that's not a secret, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Paul Baran started a company doing that in 1985</a>".</p>

<p>A crafty tradesman is perpetually disclosing some relevant fragments of their trade knowledge at all times, in part to demonstrate competence, and in part to test whether what they know is really true.</p>

<p>As far as disclosure of trade secrets goes, I'd be much more worried about details leaking out inadvertently via ill-considered partners and subcontractors than via an investor.</p>

      <p>THIS WEEK IN MAPS, for Sunday, October 30, 2011: A late October snowstorm is heading up the East Coast of the United States for Halloween. Here's maps of the affected areas, showing what parts of the electrical grid have had the worst impact from the heavy, wet snow in the forecast.</p>
