<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The San Francisco Chronicle has a story about how important it is to keep an accurate set of maps:&#0160;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/12/31/MNLS1MJ8GM.DTL" target="_self">Missing maps mean PG&amp;E lines weren&#39;t inspected</a>. The story is from December 31, 2011:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. failed to check nearly 14 miles of gas distribution pipelines for leaks for up to two decades when it lost track of 16 maps needed to guide mandated safety inspections of its system in eastern Contra Costa County, company officials acknowledged to state regulators Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;The result of the missing inspections: long-overdue discovery of seven leaks along over 13 miles of pipeline, including one repair that was &quot;urgent&quot;.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-28-5-popular-maps/">5 most popular maps of 2011 for this blog</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Here's the 5 most popular mapping pages on Vacuum over the past 12 months - these are all in the top 10 most popular pages on this blog overall in that time span.</p>

<p>1.  <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">Power outage maps for 50 states</a>. I only really have about 44 states with maps, but the collection is otherwise excellent, and it gets lots of search traffic when there are big storms. Peak storm action of Hurricane Irene and of the Halloween snowstorm that hit the Northeast both saw 3000+ visits per day of people looking for outage maps for their area.</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/01/australia-flood-map-january-10-2011.html">Australia flood maps for January, 2011.</a> Brisbane got socked with floods in January, and the maps capture the weather at the time plus links of the day and some astounding flood footage.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/2011-vermont-flood-maps-irene.html">Vermont flood maps for Hurricane Irene.</a> When Irene hit Vermont, roads were washed out, travel was disrupted, and towns were cut off from the world. A number of organizations put together rapid response flooding maps, and some of these are saved here.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/tsunami-maps-for-march-2011-honshu-earthquake.html">Tsunami maps</a> and maps of Fukushima after the nuclear disaster in Japan. It was easy to be glued to the net for news in March about the Honshu earthquake and its impact on Japan; this post was put together the day of the quake as news slowly emerged about tsunami risks.</p>

<p>5. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/central-texas-fires.html">Central Texas fire maps.</a> Put together for friends and family near Austin, Texas, this collection of maps includes the Weather Underground fire layer map, one of the best near real time fire watching tools out there, as seen for the Bastrop County, Texas fires in September.</p>

<p>What do I conclude about this? </p>

<p>If all I wanted to do was maximize the number of page views that I got, I would be consistently pulling together maps about every modern day meteorological disaster. Fire, flood, power outage, tsunami, hurricane, snowstorm, have at it - every single one of them has a map to go with the story, and every time there's a story someone looks for the map to go with it.</p>

<p>Most news reporting doesn't pull in anywhere near the richness and detail that a good set of map searches will do, and most map sites that display real time data don't save every possible newsworthy map event. Combine these two, and you can be certain that the maps you collect will tell a story that's otherwise hard to illustrate.</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil. Add the leeks to the pan, with a sprinkling of oregano on top. Cook the leeks until just browned. Deglaze the pan with a little rice wine. Add cashews and feta, return to the heat, and cook until the feta is warm and just starting to melt.</p>
<p>Serve over pasta.</p>
<p>Yum! Serves 2.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If I read Facebook for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;like&quot; things, and generally let people know that I exist.</p>
<p>If I read Twitter for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;favorite&quot; things, and generally let people know that they exist.</p>
<p>When I sit in front of Typepad ready to type, it&#39;s not always for the short post, and often it&#39;s not even for an audience. My working assumption is that unless I&#39;m writing about something that the world cares about, only a handful of people will see it. The other working assumption is that I really don&#39;t know before I write it how it will be received, so it better be good enough for me to want to refer to again just for myself.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve referred to Vacuum as an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s also a place to capture &quot;interior stories&quot;, internal monologue that makes sense about how you do things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.getstoried.com/2010/05/19/interview-christina-baldwin/" target="_self">(Christina) Baldwin</a> says that if people aren’t attached to their interior stories, they get <span style="background-color: #80ffff;">addicted to feedback</span>. Although I would have considered myself attached to my interior story, I also recognize a social-media feedback addiction in myself. I’m always curious about what kinds of comments that my, for example, Facebook status updates, have generated. (from <a href="http://astoriedcareer.com/2010/06/those-unattached-to-their-inte.html" target="_self">A Storied Career</a>, &#0160;a blog by&#0160;Kathy Hansen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you write to inform yourself, and the goal isn&#39;t to create or please your followers, or to get new ones, or to up your page view count or close a new lead. It&#39;s just to write, and to capture what&#39;s going by in your head to the level that you can recreate it later.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog has always been for me an exercise in locating other people&#39;s words to help illustrate my point. That gives it some measure of similarity to a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2010/12/its-worth-writing-it-down-even-if-you-dont-know-who-the-audience-is-yet.html" target="_self">commonplace book</a>, a traditional way to copy out bits of prose that you wish to make your own into a kind of clippings book or scrapbook of words.</p>
<p>I&#39;m content, really, to be &quot;addicted to feedback&quot;, but I reserve the right to look for the right kind of feedback to tune into. The feedback of blogging is the long, low rumble of old notebooks that have just the right relevant bits to tune into, and not just the shrill, high ping of social media contacts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://bjfogg.com" target="_self">BJ Fogg</a> is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce <a href="http://bit.ly/3tinyhabits" target="_self">three tiny habits</a> that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a perfect example of a tiny habit, since cleaning the kitchen can take a while.</p>
<p>The practice of tiny habits is radically different from the typical New Year&#39;s Resolution which is grandiose, sweeping, and hard to fulfill. &quot;Be a better person&quot; is really different from &quot;brush your teeth after you floss them&quot; or &quot;go to bed after the computer goes to sleep&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out the tiny habit that will get me writing regularly. Ideally, in some perfect world, I&#39;d write more regularly. I don&#39;t want a &quot;write a page every day&quot; goal, because that&#39;s largely unmanagable - when would I do it? But perhaps I can set myself a tiny goal, that&#39;s more like &quot;when I sit down at the computer after the kitchen is clean, open it up to my blog and start writing until I stop.&quot;</p>
<p>At the very least, that will ensure that the kitchen will be clean before bedtime.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There&#39;s a great use of the term in an LA Magazine review of &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.</blockquote>
<p>Credits: the &quot;mental rolodex&quot; term is one I heard first from&#0160;<a href="http://trybean.com">Terry Bean</a>, who used it at an LA2M presentation. It&#39;s also from&#0160;<a href="http://rebekahburgess.blogspot.com/">Rebekah Burgess&#39;s weblog of the same name</a>, where she is doing a daily photograph and filing that away for reference.&#0160;</p>
<p>And kids, if you don&#39;t know what a rolodex is, it&#39;s from the days when people had land lines phones only and their phones were so dumb that they didn&#39;t have an address book built into them. Instead, they wrote down phone numbers on little pieces of specially shaped paper, and those pieces of paper fit into a clever device that could be flipped through or (in ultra cool setup) spun like a Ferris wheel.</p>

      <p>Typepad has a very convenient &quot;drafts&quot; folder into which you can write things that aren&#39;t ready for publication yet. My drafts folder is overflowing. I suppose that means that the editor in me is looking forward to reviewing them and sending them back for revisions.</p>
<p>If you wait long enough between the time you write something and the time you publish it, it&#39;s possible that you can make your writing enough better to be worth the wait. Generally, though, the work that I like the most has been edited in public. If my writing doesn&#39;t escape the draft folder quickly, chances are pretty good that it isn&#39;t ever worth publishing, even in an open notebook.</p>

Digitization is seen variously as a boon and scourge, depending on the viewer, the issue at hand, and sometimes even the time of day. As with many polarizing phenomena, there is merit on both sides. If we look carefully at the functions that we want libraries to perform, we see that although most (but not all) are made technically easier with digitization, many are made organizationally more difficult, both within libraries and within the institutions that support them and use them. Preservation, which I will argue is an essential function of academic libraries, is the most straightforward example of something that is much more difficult to organize with digital media than it was with print. Scholarly publishing, without which libraries would have little to do, is stuck with a set of institutions and practices that are ill-suited to take advantage of digital technologies. And then there is copyright. Taking as given that we now live in a world where it extremely inexpensive to copy, distribute, search, mix, and remix, it is still not entirely clear how best to respond to what should be good news. The answers depend on what we want and how willing we are to collaborate in the interest of achieving it. As in many cases, successful exploitation of changes in technology requires changes in the way activities are organized.<br />

      </h3>
      <p><blockquote>[New] technologies are currently being viewed as either substitutes for, or possible augmentations of, human faculties. I argue that the proffered scenarios of computerized ‘help’ for human activities evident in the ubiquitous computing world tends to focus on augmentation of human remembering, with sensors and computer networks archiving vast amounts of data, but neglects to consider what augmentation might mean when it comes to that other human activity, namely, forgetting. (5)</blockquote>
<p><small>via <a href="http://www.contemplativecomputing.org/2011/12/forgetting-as-a-feature-not-a-bug.html">www.contemplativecomputing.org</a></small></p>
<p>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is reading an article by <a href="http://www.idc.ul.ie/people/liam-bannon" target="_self">Liam Bannon</a>, director of the Interaction Design Centre at the University of Limerick, on forgetting as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>I started down the path of thinking about how computers currently handle the process of forgetting, and as part of that better understand what kind of metaphors are missing for the task of augmenting forgetting.</p>
<p>There&#39;s the notion of &quot;garbage collection&quot;, when unwanted memory is reclaimed. That process relies on a way of marking unwanted (computer) memory as forgettable. Every so often the garbage collection process runs, slowing down the system as it does, and cleaning up the mess left behind.</p>
<p>Computers also have the notion and defect of a &quot;memory leak&quot;, where unwanted memory accumulates in a state where it&#39;s taking up space but not really doing anything. A slow memory leak in a long running process will eventually bring a system down as more and more system resources are absorbed and never freed.</p>
<p>When memory does go bad in a computer world, it&#39;s &quot;bitrot&quot; - think about old tapes that have glitch errors, or more importantly old computer programs that have a hard time digesting new formats of data. This often happens when a new and improved technology foregoes compatibility with old formats, with the clean slate being easier to build from rather than re-encrufting some old system.</p>
<p>Cloud computing has its own feature of forgetting, in the &quot;sunset&quot; phase of an online service where unpopular, unprofitable, or unendearing features or services get deliberately turned off. If you had relied on that system for your external memory you are in for a rude surprise.</p>
<p>The worrisome aspect of computer memory is its binary nature, where a single transient glitch can render mass storage unreadable, and so rather than the healthy forgetting of the human brain you get sudden unrecoverable failure. Your carefully pickled up thoughts or rolodex full of context vanishes, and suddenly you have to rely on your mental rolodex rather than the paper or electronic one to recall details.</p>

<p>New Orleans is a great place to eat a sandwich. <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/686440">Chowhound has a best sandwiches</a> thread that's got a lot of great suggestions; I'd pick a banh mi (in its role as a Vietnamese po'boy).

<p>The Zing sandwich was done by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanstreetfood">San Street</a>, a food cart which alas I have not checked out myself yet.</p>

<p>The Viet World Kitchen blog has a <a href="http://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/06/banh-mi-sandwich-recipe.html">master banh mi recipe</a> which pretty much sums up what you'd need to put together your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is essentially one sandwich in Vietnamese cooking and it is quite a tour de force. It started out very simply, with baguette smeared with liver pate and that was it. That's how my mom knew it in the 1940s when she was growing up in Northern Vietnam. What we know today as banh mi is a light, crispy small baguette that is split and hollowed before it is invariably filled with homemade mayonnaise or butter (which I don't like), sliced chili pepper, cilantro leaves, cucumber, a tangy-sweet daikon and carrot pickle (do chua), and a drizzle of soy sauce. The variation comes in when you choose what protein component(s) will be center stage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More recipe action gets you a <a href="http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2010/08/13/do-chua-vietnamese-carrot-and-daikon-pickle/">do chua recipe from the blog Sticky Gooey Creamy Chewy</a>, which sounds easy enough to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do chua is so incredibly easy to make. Since it is a “fresh” pickle, there is no boiling or cooking involved. All you do is julienne the carrots and daikon, and soak them in a brine made with white vinegar, rice wine vinegar, a little water, sugar and a pinch of salt. That’s it!  Plus, the pickles only need to marinate in their brine for about an hour before they’re ready to devour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2002, NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites are unique in their ability to measure variations in water stored at all levels above and within the land surface (terrestrial water storage). However, the spatial (>150,000 km2) and temporal (monthly with a significant time lag) resolutions of the GRACE fields limit their direct applicability for drought assessment. In order to increase the resolution, eliminate the time lag, and isolate groundwater and other components from total terrestrial water storage, scientists at NASA/GSFC integrate the GRACE data with other ground- and space-based meteorological observations (precipitation, solar radiation, etc.) within the Catchment Land Surface Model, using Ensemble Kalman smoother type data assimilation (Zaitchik et al., 2008). The resulting fields of soil moisture and groundwater storage variations are then used to generate drought indicators based on the cumulative distribution function of wetness conditions during 1948-2009 simulated by the Catchment model. Houborg et al. (2011) provide complete details on GRACE-based drought indicator product generation.</p>

<p>Got it? This map shows groundwater storage estimated with this model, showing the extensive drought conditions in Texas as well as the wet northeast.</p>

<p>Snow days go on television: <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/subindex/weather/closings">Channel 2 snow day</a> listings, <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/weather/school-closings-alt/-/4714938/-/3nvw37z/-/index.html">Channel 4 snow day</a> listings, <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/subindex/weather/school_closings">Channel 7 snow day</a> listings. These all cover greater Metro Detroit.</p>

<p>Snow days go on the radio; check 24 hour news stations like <a href="http://wjr.com">WJR</a> 990 and <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/station/wwj-newsradio-950/">WWJ</a> 760.</p>

<p>Snow days are announced without the assistance of the media, e.g. <a href="http://a2schools.org/aaps/home">Ann Arbor Public Schools</a> which publishes directly.</p>
