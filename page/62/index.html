<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

outages and cleanup from a powerful winter storm that hammered Kentucky
this week.</div><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The state, along with 68 counties and 36 cities, were

<strong>Ice Storm Update</strong> - updated 9 p.m., January 28</p> 
<p>A significant winter storm is currently affecting our service area.<br /><br />

As of 9 p.m., 100,000 LG&amp;E customers are without power. KU has 175,000 customers without power throughout the state.<br /><br />

</p><ul>
<li>Overall, 5,800 wires are down, up about a thousand more than what were down as a result of the September 2008 wind storm.</li>
<li>We
are pulling resources from the southern states of Georgia (1,100
workers), Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as some
from Michigan to assist with the restoration.</li>
<li>Estimating 7 to 10 days before full restoration will occur in LG&amp;E&#39;s service area.</li>
<li>Statewide, full restoration may take up to two weeks.</li>
<li>The
potential exists for additional outages as the weight of snow and ice
can be enough to snap or bend tree limbs, causing them to bring down
power lines disrupting electrical service. In severe ice storms, the
weight of large accumulations of ice on power lines themselves can
cause the lines to fall without the involvement of trees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>From President Obama in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/FreedomofInformationAct/" target="_blank">memo to the heads of federal agencies</a>:
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires
transparency.&#0160; As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants.”&#0160; In our democracy, the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through
transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national
commitment to ensuring an open Government.&#0160; At the heart of that
commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the
Government and the citizenry alike.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a
clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.&#0160; The
Government should not keep information confidential merely because
public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and
failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract
fears.&#0160; Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the
personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they
are supposed to serve.&#0160; In responding to requests under the FOIA,
executive branch agencies (agencies) should act promptly and in a
spirit of cooperation, recognizing that such agencies are servants of
the public.</em></p>

Ill., January 26, 2008 – Starting today, legal educators will have the
capability to search, make use of, and share more legal educational
materials than ever before. The Center for Computer-Assisted Legal
Instruction (“<a href="http://cali.org">CALI</a>”), in collaboration with Harvard’s Berkman Center
for Internet and Society, is launching an open, searchable collection
of resources designed specifically for use in legal education: a “Legal
Education Commons” (“<a href="http://www.cali.org/lec">LEC</a>”). </span><strong><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">“All
teachers of law have materials and notes they use in teaching,” says
John Mayer, CALI Executive Director. “Many freely share their materials
with colleagues, but there has never been a singular searchable,
taggable space to serve that function for the entire legal academy,” he
explains, “until now.” The LEC is available online at www.cali.org/lec.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Legal Education Commons launches with over 700,000 federal court
decisions readily available to its users. This initial collection of
cases from public.resource.org makes the LEC one of the largest
gatherings of case law freely available in one place under a creative
commons license. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and largest pool of free images designed specifically for use in legal
education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

implores faculty and staff at CALI member schools to share any files
from personal collections that may facilitate learning amongst the
legal education community. “Especially as we increasingly garner more
participation and sharing from legal educators,” says Mr. Mayer, “the
Legal Education Commons will be a great, non-commercial tool for those
who are both teaching and learning the law.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

      <p>One of my very favorite weblogs from Michigan Tech is the aptly named <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">Backyard Arthropod Project: A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>, which is written in a style that a professional metallurgist and amateur entomologist can do.&#0160; It&#39;s hosted on somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com .</p><p>This week&#39;s post is a very lovely photo set of a Canadian Tiger Swallowtail butterfly.&#0160; The account of the identification of the <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/7367"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Papilio canadensis</span></a> is accompanied by a story of how it was collected, footnoted of course, with this note about the use of the word &quot;snarge&quot;:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">[2] I just heard this word on the news recently, as a direct result
of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,602092,00.html">the airliner that had to ditch in the Hudson river when its engines
both quit, possibly due to birds getting sucked into them</a>. It seems
that, when birds hit aircraft, the FAA always wants to know what <em>kind</em>
of bird it was, so that they can figure out their habits and try to
work out how to keep them away from the planes. So, they send any
remains that they find stuck to the plane afterwards to the <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/highlight/feathers/">Smithsonian
Institution’s Feather Identification Laboratory</a>, who figure out what it
was when it was alive. The technical term for these remains is
“snarge”. Technically, I suppose it is limited to what you get when
birds collide with aircraft, but I think it is legitimate to generalise
it to “remains of any animal after colliding with any vehicle”. So the
bug smears on your windshield, and the moths in your radiator, are all
snarge.</p><p>When my stepdad used to collect recently deceased animals to have his students check for parasites for his biology classes at Northern Michigan University, we called it roadkill; I guess snarge is a fancy federal name for airborne roadkill.</p><p>The <a href="http://wildlife-mitigation.tc.faa.gov/public_html/index.html">FAA Airport Wildlife Hazard
Mitigation Home Page</a> has much much more information on this topic, including a searchable database of bird strikes and lots of detailed data. </p>

&#0160;Faculty Candidate Talk:<br />
&quot;Understanding and Modeling Properties of Social Networks&quot; Lars
Backstrom is a graduate student at Cornell University in the Computer
Science Department. His work is supported by a Yahoo Research
Fellowship. In this talk¸ he will describe how social networks have
always been an integral part of people&#39;s lives. Until recently¸ these
networks have remained hidden¸ or been exposed only on very small
scales¸ where it is impossible to deduce more general trends. With the
advent of Web sites like Facebook and MySpace¸ however¸ we can begin to
develop models of social networks which capture the trends governing
the growth and evolution of these networks. With rich datasets from
multiple networks¸ researchers are now able to glean general principles
which give insight into the nature of social networks. </p><p>Backstrom will
discuss two questions related to our understanding of social networks.
First¸ he will look at some of the principles related to the formation
of new edges in social networks. Second¸ he will look at the growth of
explicitly declared communities in networks. He will discuss how the
evolution of these communities relates to the properties of the
underlying social network. He will wrap up his talk by discussing some
of the thorny privacy issues surrounding the study of these networks.</p><p>
All are invited to attend. To promote in-depth intellectual engagement
during the seminar¸ all are encouraged to <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/research/papers/backstrom_paper_012109.pdf" target="_blank">read

<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">AATA proposes changes to fare structure </span></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><font face="Arial"><span>ANN ARBOR</span><span>, MI</span><span>
– The Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) is seeking public input
on proposed changes to its fare structure for fixed-route and
paratransit services at a series of public meetings to be held in
February.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">According
to AATA Board Chair David Nacht, the adult full fare for AATA
fixed-route service has not changed since August, 2002. Since that
time, AATA has experienced significant increases in the cost of
operations, as well as the tightening of available funding. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">“AATA
has cut costs for aspects of our operations under our control, as well
as generating revenue through the sale of advertising space on our
buses,” Nacht said.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA
reduced its 2009 fixed-route operating costs by $5 per service hour
through a variety of cost-saving measures. A review of comparable
transit systems revealed that AATA had the lowest fares among its peers.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">In
addition, AATA has implemented continuous improvement teams to further
control and reduce energy use, facility and vehicle maintenance,
employee benefits and expenses related to its paratransit services.
Approximately $300,000 in savings has been identified by the teams
through projects which are expected to be implemented in the current
fiscal year.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">“The
board is reluctant to raise fares, and actually rejected a fare
increase proposal in 2006. Now we find that we must balance the impact
on our riders with our need to run the authority in a financially
prudent manner.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA
has reached the point where we must consider revisions to our fare
structure in order to assure that we are successful in meeting the
growing demand for our services during this time of economic challenge,
and also to ensure the future financial health of the authority,” Nacht
said.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA’s
proposal includes a two-phase increase to change the current
fixed-route adult full fare of $1.00 to $1.25 in May, 2009 and to $1.50
in May, 2010. Current half-fare charges would go from 50 cents to 60
and 75 cents, respectively. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The
proposal would eliminate the 25-cent fare on fixed-route service for
Seniors and A-Ride customers; however, the fares on paratransit service
would increase from $2.00 for an advance reservation trip to $2.50 in
2009 and $3.00 in 2010. Same-day trip fares would increase from $3.00
to $3.50 and $4.00, respectively.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Night Ride and Holiday Ride fares would remain at $5.00, with the fare for Senior and A-Ride cardholders remaining at $2.50.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">In
addition to 30-day passes, shorter-term passes are being considered at
both regular and reduced-fare levels. These may include passes for a
smaller number of days, or a specific number of trips.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The full draft proposal is available on the AATA web site, <a href="http://www.TheRide.org" target="_blank">www.TheRide.org</a>,
and by request at 734.973.6500. The proposal will also be available
beginning January 24, 2009 in the February, 2009 issue of “RideLines”
on all AATA buses and at the AATA main office and transit centers.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The
proposed fare structure is expected to generate an estimated $314,000
in additional revenue in the first year and $540,000 in the second
year. It will also create opportunities for frequent riders who qualify
to take advantage of discounted passes.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><font face="Arial">Comments
and questions about the proposed fare changes are being received by
AATA through February 27, 2009 by the following methods:</font></p>

<p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">January 18, 2009: </span></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Based on this information, and on the current
state of the investigation, the FDA recommends that consumers avoid
eating products that have been recalled and discard them.&#0160; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Because identification of products
subject to recall is continuing, the FDA urges consumers to postpone
eating commercially-prepared or manufactured peanut butter-containing
products and institutionally-served peanut butter until further
information becomes available about which products may be
affected.&#0160;Efforts to specifically identify those products are ongoing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a very active and dynamic investigation into the source of the<em> Salmonella</em> Typhimurium outbreak.&#0160; At this time, the FDA has traced a source of<em> Salmonella</em>
Typhimurium contamination to a plant owned by Peanut Corporation of
America (PCA), which manufactures both peanut butter that is
institutionally served in such settings as long-term care facilities
and cafeterias, and peanut paste?a concentrated product consisting of
ground, roasted peanuts?that is distributed to food manufacturers to be
used as an ingredient in many commercially produced products including
cakes, cookies, crackers, candies, cereal and ice cream.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The FDA has notified PCA that product samples
originating from its Blakely, Ga., processing plant have been tested
and found positive for<em> Salmonella</em> by laboratories in the
states of Minnesota and Georgia.&#0160; The state of Minnesota has reported
to FDA that its samples of King Nut peanut butter are a genetic match
to the strain of<em> Salmonella</em> that has caused illnesses in that state and around the country.&#0160; King Nut is a distributor of PCA product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On January 16, PCA expanded its voluntary recall
to include all peanut butter produced on or after August 8, 2008, and
all peanut paste produced on or after September 26, 2008, in its
Blakely, Ga., plant because of potential<em> Salmonella</em>
contamination.&#0160; The product being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk
packaging in containers ranging in size from five to 1700 pounds.&#0160; The

product sold by the tanker container.&#0160; These products are not sold
directly to consumers.&#0160; PCA has stopped all production at its Blakely,
Ga. plant as the FDA continues its investigation into the source of the<em> Salmonella</em> contamination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At this time, there is no indication that any
national name brand jars of peanut butter sold in retail stores are
linked to the PCA recall.&#0160; As the investigation continues over the

<p><font face="Arial">The FDA is working closely with members of the
food industry to narrow this advice and to publish a detailed list of
implicated products as soon as possible.&#0160; The FDA is encouraging
manufacturers to help inform consumers about whether their
products&#0160;could have contained&#0160;commercially prepared peanut butter or
peanut paste from PCA.&#0160; Also, if manufacturers know their products do
not&#0160;contain ingredients from PCA, they may wish to inform consumers of
that fact.&#0160; Retailers should stop selling products which have been
recalled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For information on products containing peanut
butter from companies not reporting recalls, consumers may wish to
consult the company?s website or call the toll-free number listed on
most packaging.&#0160; Information consumers may receive from the companies
has not been verified by the FDA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The FDA will closely monitor these events by
continuing to work with the firms on the details of their actions,
conduct follow-up audits and inspections, monitor the progress of the
firms? actions, and notify our foreign regulatory counterparts of
products that may have been distributed internationally.</font></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table></p>

PRESS RELEASE</p><p>
Ann Arbor Skatepark Action Committee Announces The Ann Arbor Skatepark Fund and The Ann Arbor Skatepark Endowment Fund</p><p>
Ann Arbor, January 19 – The Ann Arbor Skatepark Action Committee is
starting its big-time fundraising with the formation of two funds at
The Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation. One of the funds will support
the design and construction of the skatepark, the other is an endowment
to help the City pay for maintenance, improvements and upgrades. Ten
percent of each gift to the Ann Arbor Skatepark goes to the endowment
fund.</p><p>
The Ann Arbor Skatepark Fund supports the construction of a free public
skatepark where Ann Arbor&#39;s skaters can safely and responsibly practice
their sport. Donors to the Fund become partners in the Ann Arbor
Skatepark Action Committee&#39;s efforts to promote healthy exercise and
safe spaces for youth, while also involving young people in their
community. Your commitment to the Fund thus enhances Ann Arbor&#39;s
reputation as one of the nation&#39;s safest, healthiest and most
family-friendly places to live.</p><p>
The Ann Arbor Skatepark Endowment Fund will support the ongoing
maintenance of the Skatepark. Supporters of the Fund ensure that this
important addition to the community&#39;s outstanding system of parks and
recreational facilities remains safe and attractive for generations of
Ann Arborites to come.</p><p>
Everyone who makes a commitment to the fund by February 28, 2009 will be honored as an establishing donor.</p><p>
To support the Ann Arbor Skatepark, email fundraising chair Jim Reische at <a href="mailto:jreische@a2skatepark.org">jreische@a2skatepark.org</a>.</p><p>

2. &#0160;Not going to talk about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/the-bus-game-why-its-important-to-get-the-aatas-mobile-ridetrak-back-online.html">how the AATA Ridetrak is down</a> and how it&#39;s been down for a month; that&#39;s a message to the AATA board, not this board.</p><p>
3. &#0160;Not going to talk about <a href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/2008/2368">Rob Goodspeed&#39;s article showing that structures are on average half empty</a> (which got an immediate response from Rene Greff), because I don&#39;t generally drive to town.</p><p>What I did talk about:</p><p>Sidewalks are not promptly cleared after snow storms, to the detriment of pedestrians. &#0160;In particular there is a dangerous part at the curb, where <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/safetyservices/Police/Pages/SnowRemovalonSidewalks.aspx">the property owner (who is responsible for the sidewalk)</a> and <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/GOVERNMENT/PUBLICSERVICES/FIELDOPERATIONS/Pages/SnowRemoval.aspx">the city (who is responsible for the street)</a> share responsibility for the failure to clear the curb, resulting in huge puddles at corners.</p><p>
I showed the DDA my pair of Yaktrax (<a href="http://bit.ly/yaktrax" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/yaktrax</a>) and suggested that someone could make good money selling them from a cart on the street on icy days. (thanks to John Hritz for that timely holiday present).</p><p>Look for more coverage from the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>
