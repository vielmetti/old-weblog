<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>I want an ebook reader on my phone, so that I can read stories to my kids with the lights out. &#0160;Better yet if the ebooks have just enough pictures to satisfy the need for pictures.</p><p>
I have a bootlegged ASCII text from 1987 published by The Cult of the Dead Cow of Dr. Seuss&#39;s &quot;Cat In The Hat&quot;. It&#39;s perfect to read on my Blackberry. &#0160;I don&#39;t read the preface to the three year old, which reads as follows:</p><p>
====</p><p>
Ed. Note: I typed this file at 7am after a long day under the influence<br />
of too much Diet Coke and DayGlow Abortions music in the background.<br />
At a time such as this, I enjoy Dr. Seuss and find it quite soothing to read<br />
his literature. I also enjoy verbally degrading my dog and hyperventilating.<br />
At any rate, this is a great piece of..literature to have and deserves a place<br />
in your library. Thanks to Tippy Turtle (Bunny Lust author) for providing<br />
me with this delightful book.</p><p>

If I was going to spend any time (personal or professional) doing electronic publishing, I&#39;d aim squarely at the market of parents reading stories to their kids from their mobile phones.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>LONG-LOST OPERATIC FRAGMENT COMES TO LIGHT</p>

<p><p>
During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the
great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering
capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of
their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of
the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe
Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the
Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music
community even this crumbling shard of Verde&#39;s never-performed
Il Internetto.<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Curtain rises. It is night. A storm is gathering over the
battlements of a crumbling red brick office building. In the
background, the houses and lights of a fair but troubled city,
An&#39;Arbro. We hear the rumbling of distant thunder.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Enter Edmundo. He leans on the crenalations and contemplates
the approaching storm.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
Edmundo: Solo mio, vendro unscrupuloso, custombres sansaclu.
(I am all alone, my vendors are of questionable ethics, and my
customers are idiots.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
La Traciata (off): Edmundo! Edmundo!<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Edmundo: Che? (What?)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
La Traciata (entering): Doloroso executivo, executivo perdu,
pite&#39;, pite&#39;, au secours, le boite de multiplexico delenda est.
 (Oh, pitious executive, help, help, the modem is broke.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Small boy (dashing across the stage): Providitore connection,
imbecilico! (Ameritech, idiots!)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>(Off) sound of a news server crashing; alarms and excursions.
<br />
</em>
</p><p>
Don Miguele (entering): Si mentate io, periculoso meo! (If I
had a brain, I&#39;d be dangerous!)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
El Zastrow (drawing a baguette from beneath her chemise): Prends
 ca, compteur de legumes suburbanitico! Mangez le pain de ma
tante! (Take that, yuppie bean counter! Eat flaming starch!)
<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Enter four horsemen, Edmundo, Esteban, Owen Glynmorange, and
 Tim the Irascible. They begin to sing an old Provencal round
 consisting of four or five conflicting business plans.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
La Traciata: Ai, yi yi yi yi yi, carriage de corrosion, mi corizon
non di Finisterre. Reimburse&#39; mi. (Alas, my car is a rusting
heap of junk and I cannot afford clothing from Land&#39;s End.
 Sure would be nice to get paid.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Lindhilde (dressed as the Kouros of Berners-Lee): Luftpost der
 Webdamen! Toten der Lapinnet, Toten der Lapinnet! Der krieg
 sind Deutchenyowlen: zu viel und laut! Wer is mein petroleum?
 (The flight of the web ladies! Kill the wabbitnet, kill
the wabbitnet! War is like German opera: too long and too
loud! Where is that damn gas tank?)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Chorus of the busy signals: Bzzz. Bzzz. Bzzz.<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Night falls. The slain are born away to Valhalla or Ypsilanti.
 Edmundo enters dressed as a virtual transaction. As the curtain
 falls, he sings the plaintive and moving aria, &quot;Yo Dudo

<p>I have an index card stuck in my copy of Anne Lamott&rsquo;s Bird By
Bird. In that essay, she exhorts the reader to write down
the ideas and thoughts and clever lines of dialog and whatever else
they want to remember on a handy index card (carry one, folded, in
your back pocket so you don&rsquo;t look bulky). I just reread
it out loud to myself, and now I kick myself for not having recorded
myself to listen to it again (not for you all mind you, just for
me).</p>

<p>Bird By Bird is one of my favorite books about writing, and it turns out that it reads really well too - marvelous.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t carry index cards with me all the time - for a while I did,
and now I&rsquo;ve stopped, more or less. That should be fixable,
and the completely inexcusable case where I don&rsquo;t even have a
pen with me is fixable too.</p>

<p>The digital equivalents I have for them are either pages in my
personal wiki (again, not for you, just for me) or posts like this
one in whichever blog seems the most relevant. In
both cases the Socialtext and Typepad support for Blackberry devices
are key to having some reasonable web-based system that&rsquo;s always
available especially when I&#39;m on the bus.</p>

<p>The most fun I&#39;ve seen with index cards as a system has to be
<a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hawkexpress/sets/72157594200490122/">hawkexpress&#39;s PoIC (&quot;Pile of Index Cards&quot;) system</a>, which combines
ideas and methods and rigor in a way that to me is distinctly
Japanese.

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m doing the shopping these days - a farmer&#39;s market and food coop run on Saturdays, and a Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#39;s run on Sundays.&#0160; Usually I have one or the other of the boys with me, and often there&#39;s some amount of hurry to get the whole process done.</p><p>I&#39;m not used to doing grocery shopping, but going with the boys helps since they have been doing it all along.</p><p>Here&#39;s some ways I seem to manage to get through four shopping experiences a week even though I have famously low shopping tolerance.</p><p>0.&#0160; Work from a list, always.&#0160; Take inventory of your perishables before you buy more perishables; take inventory of your pantry before you refill the pantry.&#0160; We keep a list by the fridge so that when something gets used up that should stay in stock it gets added to for the next round.</p><p>1.&#0160; Shop at farmer&#39;s market first.&#0160; You don&#39;t know what will be a super deal, and what will be in season, and what oddly shaped root vegetable will catch your eye with a farmer who will tell you how to cook it.&#0160; So do that part of the week&#39;s shopping first, and work around it as you do your menu plan.&#0160; </p><p>2.&#0160; Always take the same route through the farmer&#39;s market.&#0160; Mostly the farmers are in the same stalls week after week, or if they move one week they will stay put the next.&#0160; I know where to get onions, garlic, eggs, apples, greens, and herbs, and which places I need to check out but not buy at right away because someone might have a better deal.</p><p>3.&#0160; Do a weekly menu plan, synchronized around your shopping week.&#0160; In our case the farmer&#39;s market is on Saturday and the menu plan gets made on Sunday morning while we eat pancakes, and so we have a good idea of what produce we&#39;re working with and enough time to get all of the supplemental produce and pantry staples on a Sunday shopping to make a week&#39;s worth of meal plans.</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160; Make a list of menu suggestions.&#0160; Keep track of meals that you&#39;ve made and liked, and don&#39;t be afraid to repeat yourself at appropriate intervals or in appropriate seasons.&#0160; When it comes time to plan a week&#39;s meals, you don&#39;t want to start with a blank piece of paper; I find that the two weeks ago menu generally has one or two good ideas for this week for things you aren&#39;t sick of.</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160; Always take the same route through the store, and organize your shopping list according to the store layout.&#0160; That means for our Whole Foods that the order goes vegetables, bulk foods, canned goods, cheese, bread, while at Trader Joes the order is bread, cheese, yogurt, frozen veg, canned goods, snacks.&#0160; You should be able to walk through the store without backtracking to pick up everything you need.</p><p>6.&#0160; Put away your food in the same place every time.&#0160; This might sound silly, but if you keep the beans on the left and the tomatoes on the right always then you can always inventory your tomatoes and know how much you need to buy.&#0160; Randomness is not your friend in the pantry.</p><p>7.&#0160; Get home delivery of as many heavy things as you can.&#0160; We get enough milk to feed two growing boys delivered weekly, and that cuts 25 pounds of weight off the grocery cart.</p><p>A few notes.&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you get most of this process from someone who used to do it all the time and got good at it, even with little kids in tow; left to my own devices I&#39;m much more random.&#0160; Two good mottos to follow are &quot;every meal accounted for&quot; and &quot;no backtracking&quot;.&#0160; The only flaw in my design is the no alcohol before Sunday noon Michigan law, which makes buying beer and wine an exception rather than a regular easy to follow process.&#0160;&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you&#39;re vegetarian and have a big recipe list built up over the years and enough spices in your spice cabinet to get variety from variations on a theme.&#0160; And I still don&#39;t have a middle eastern or Korean grocery in my regular routine, which by rights should happen about 1x/mo each.</p>

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN LARGE SOCIAL AND INFORMATION NETWORKS<br />
Michael W. Mahoney<br />
Stanford University</p><p>
The concept of a community is central to social network analysis, and
thus a large body of work has been devoted to identifying community
structure. For example, a community may be thought of as a set of web
pages on related topics, a set of people who share common interests, or
more generally as a set of nodes in a network more similar amongst
themselves than with the remainder of the network. &#0160;Motivated by
difficulties we experienced at actually finding meaningful communities
in large real-world networks, we have performed a large scale analysis
of a wide range of social and information networks. &#0160;Our main
methodology uses local spectral methods and involves computing
isoperimetric properties of the networks at various size scales -- a
novel application of ideas from scientific computation to internet data
analysis. Our empirical results suggest a significantly more refined
picture of community structure than has been appreciated previously.
Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network dataset we
examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities at very small
size scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible communities
gradually ``blend in&#39;&#39; with the rest of the network and thus become
less ``community-like.&#39;&#39; This behavior is not explained, even at a
qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation
models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one
would expect based on experience with and intuition from expander
graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional
structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds
of community detection algorithms. Possible mechanisms for reproducing
our empirical observations will be discussed, as will implications of
these findings for clustering, classification, and more general data
analysis in modern large social and information networks.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In recent days a number of modestly successful online social and productivity services have been scheduled for decommisioning.  Pownce is being turned off as that team moves to Six Apart, and I Want Sandy is going away as Rael moves to Twitter. You will see more systems get acquired and shut down with graceful exits, and some exits will not be so graceful.</p>

<p>There seem to be multiple common reasons why upstart systems get wiped out in times of economic crisis.  If your traffic is not growing and you aren't attracting legions of superstar users, it starts to look expensive to bet against a bigger rival.  Even if you do manage to pull off steady growth in usage the test may be scaling up your infrastructure to keep pace with demand.</p>

<p>If the dot com crash is any predictor of future consolidation, look for the survival of systems that address some specific real need of some narrow niche and that don't have to grow to planetary size to be profitable.  Display advertising rates continue to fall, making it more and more attractive for people to run house ads instead selling merchandise or services directly to whatever audience they can sustain.  If what you are using does more than just scratch some coder's itch you have a better chance.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 is over.  Back up your important data now, or decide which parts of it you are willing to discard.</p>

The National Press Club, the world&#39;s leading professional organization
for journalists, is teaming up with the Gerald R. Ford Presidential
Library to look at where the news business is going and how to protect
its core values. Panelists will be Jonathan Wolman, editor and
publisher of the &quot;Detroit News&quot;; Omari Gardner, news editor/digital
media at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;; Marla Drutz, vice president and
general manager, WDIV-TV, Detroit; and Vincent Duffy, news director,
Michigan Public Radio. Gil Klein, a veteran national correspondent,
former National Press Club president, and director of the club&#39;s
Centennial Forums program, will moderate. Library Director Elaine
Didier commented that &quot;President Ford had such a wonderful history with
the National Press Club, it seemed only fitting that we would host the
forum in Ann Arbor at his Presidential Library.&quot; The event will begin
with a preview of the club&#39;s centennial documentary, &quot;The National
Press Club: A Century of Headlines,&quot; which follows the history of
American journalism through the lens of one of its leading
institutions. Everyone who attends this free forum will get a copy of
the documentary. The preview will be followed by a short presentation
by Richard Ryan, a longtime &quot;Detroit News&quot; Washington correspondent and
past club president, about the relationship between Ford and the news
media. This forum is part of a nationwide conversation the National
Press Club is holding during its 100th anniversary to look at where the
news business is going and what news consumers should be demanding. The
NPC Centennial Forums program is sponsored by Aviva USA. For
information, call (734) 205-0567.

      <p>It&rsquo;s winter, your hands see cold so you are wearing gloves, but you need at least a few fingers free for your mobile phone.  What designs work?</p>

<p>The gloves I am wearing now have a flap to expose a sort of fingerless Mitten, and if I fold things right I can expose just two index fingers.  I could imagine thumbs free gloves too.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m writing this from my mobile phone, using typepad mobile to post with. As a blog post interface it works pretty well.
</p><p>
There is one key piece that is missing to make it more helpful: a search function. I don&#39;t see a way to easily search through my past posts from the phone to go back and update and edit one of them. It is easy to get to the last 5 posts but the next option is to list all 1900 entries, no thanks.
</p><p>
As a small corollary to that, I don&#39;t see an easy way to add a comment to a post either; in some cases a comment is better that an edit.

Look for more posts from the bus.

NOTES afterward:

The default edit mode is HTML, which explains why the first iteration of this post didn&#39;t have paragraph breaks. Fixed in post-production.

The application I actually used was the <a href="http://i.typepad.com/">web-based iPhone Typepad interface</a>, which works fine on the Blackberry. There is a <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-blackberry.html">Blackberry native interface</a> which I haven&#39;t tried yet.</p>

      <p>You&#39;re at a meeting, somewhere, and you want to quietly and unobtrusively take meeting notes or some other record of the meeting while it&#39;s happening, and you have a mobile phone but nothing else.</p><p>What tool or application do you use?</p><p><a href="http://m.twitter.com">Mobile twitter</a>.&#0160; Twitter your short notes out to the world, or use a direct message to some bot of some kind that collects and gathers the notes for you.&#0160;&#0160; Twitter&#39;s mobile interface is fast, simple, and reasonably complete.&#0160; Down side: no easy way to look up something about the person who just introduced themselves.</p><p><a href="http://m.facebook.com">Mobile Facebook</a>.&#0160; Write on the wall of people (or your own wall) as notes come up, and then somehow reconstruct it afterwards.&#0160; The people search tool is very handy for looking folks up on the fly, and you can send someone a followup about some question while you&#39;re still at the event.&#0160; Down side: Slow enough that if people are moving fast you don&#39;t keep up.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.com/blog/2006/04/75.html">Mobile wiki (Socialtext Miki)</a>.&#0160; Keep notes on a scratch pad on a wiki that you edit on your mobile device. A perfectly good text input box and it makes refining your notes into something longer very easy (and you can go back and figure out more about what you missed). &#0160;&#0160; Down side: no lookup on the fly, so if you fumble someone&#39;s name you can&#39;t look it up.</p><p>Other mobile contact network and social network managers - both Plaxo and LinkedIn have mobile versions, and I haven&#39;t tried to figure out how to use those while standing up and listening to be a bit more informed.</p><p>Notable here is that there isn&#39;t a single Google mobile tool in the arsenal.&#0160; The Blackberry native mail client is better than the Google Mail java client, and almost anyone can have a text box open, but if there&#39;s a mobile Orkut then my world of people doesn&#39;t use it.</p><p>If I had two hands free to do this I probably would have used delicious as a part of the process - I&#39;ve gone to a bunch of lecture or seminar type events where my pattern is to google what the speaker says and delicious the results, and if the net is fast enough where that is you can almost do that in close enough to real time to keep up.&#0160;&#0160; But that&#39;s too much and too rude to do in anything other than a lecture situation.</p><p>Paper has some tremendous uses here - one recent event I went to I used some of <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3252489">Dave Gray&#39;s visual thinking skills that he&#39;s taught and put into his new book </a>and did things like sketch what the speakers were wearing in addition to taking notes on what they were saying.&#0160;&#0160; I have a much clearer visual memory of that event, but I don&#39;t remember anyone&#39;s names.</p><p>A work in process to be sure.&#0160; There were 11 tables full of people, and I got almost everyone&#39;s names, and didn&#39;t quite catch everything I hoped to catch; thanks everyone for lunch.&#0160; The conclusion of the question at the table - would you buy a car from a bankrupt auto company? - is that most people would be worried about service and availability of maintenance and parts, and that a <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/features_classic_cars/sail_to_the_u_s_a_in_a_chevrolet_feature">Cuban mechanic</a> would be someone to keep in your rolodex, and that if the worst happens at least we can look forward to an expanded <a href="http://jalopnik.com/tag/2008-orphan-car-show/">orphan car show in Ypsi. </a></p>

      <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">Achieving Extraordinary Organizational Performance Through Diversity<br />
<span style="text-transform: none;"><em>Professor Scott Page, University of Michigan</em></span><br />
<strong>Friday, November 21, 1-2:15 p.m.</strong><br />
Founders Room, Alumni Center<br />
200 Fletcher</p>

<p>Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant
individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&#39;s
predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond
the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page
discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&#39;re talking
about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why
diversity trumps ability. Come and learn why progress depends as much
on our collective differences as it does on our individual IQ scores!
