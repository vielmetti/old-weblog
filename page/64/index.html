<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

current and dust; a rectangular drop channel through which plastic
building block toys pass from the force of vacuum momentum and gravity;
a transparent collection container for housing the plastic building
block toys during cleanup and an air-tight bottom, hinged lid for

      </h3>
      <p>When the AATA mobile ride track is up, I have a script that runs periodically to decode the web pages and turn them into data.&#0160; The pages are formatted for humans, so I need to do screen scraping on them to reconstruct the original data values.</p><p>There are a lot of tools for screen scraping, with each of them appealing to a programmer who has a certain world view of the web and how things are put together.&#0160; The tool that I find myself recommending when someone who sounds like a programmer asks is <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> (for python) or <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/RubyfulSoup/">Rubyful Soup</a> (for ruby), in part at least because the coder&#39;s attitude toward pragmatism is appropriate for the task at hand:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You didn&#39;t write that awful page. You&#39;re just trying to get some
data out of it. Right now, you don&#39;t really care what HTML is
supposed to look like.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Neither does this parser.&#0160;</p><p>Rubyful Soup&#39;s page says &quot;no longer maintained, try hpricot instead&quot;; I looked for hpricot and got some 404s.&#0160; Not sure really what&#39;s up with that.</p><p>As for what I really do, rather than what I recommend, well you have to understand that most of the code that I write that actually does anything useful is less than a page of text and mostly is full of regular expressions.&#0160;&#0160; HTML in its unadorned state is mostly resistant to simple-minded regex parsing, but if you constrain the world enough you can get most data out of most pages by running the page through a preprocessor that normalizes it into something sane.</p><p>My favorite for that effort is the old school &quot;<a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>&quot; application, which has a zillion options by now for taking your weird web pages and making them pass syntax checks.&#0160;</p><p>Thus the source of the main loop for the &quot;mobile ride guide decoder&quot;:</p><p><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">curl -s -o $TMP/route.5.html http://mobile.theride.org/rideguide_m.asp?route=5</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">tidy -f /dev/null -q -w 0 -o $TMP/route.5.tidy.html $TMP/route.5.html</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">perl ./mobiletocsv.pl &lt; $TMP/route.5.tidy.html &gt;&gt; route.5.log.csv</span></p><p>and the &quot;mobiletocsv&quot; perl script is very simple minded</p><p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">#!perl</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">while(&lt;&gt;) {</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /AS OF (\d+:\d\d)/ &amp;&amp; ($curtime = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; $realtime = `date +%H:%M`;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; chop $realtime;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) min behind/ &amp;&amp; ($late = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) min ahead/ &amp;&amp; ($late = -$1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) on time/i &amp;&amp; ($late = 0);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d\d\d) to (Ann Arbor|Ypsilanti)/ &amp;&amp; ($busno = $1, $dest = $2);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d\d\d) (OutBound|Loop)/ &amp;&amp; ($busno = $1, $dest = $2);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /^@ (.*)&lt;br&gt;/ &amp;&amp; ($curloc = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /^(.*) (\d+:\d\d)/ &amp;&amp; ($newloc = $1, $timepoint = $2,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; print &quot;$realtime,$curtime,$late,$busno,$dest,$curloc,$newloc,$timepoint\n</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&quot;);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">}</span></p><p>It&#39;s probably not resistant to aggressively malformed input, and I simply don&#39;t run it when the result is &quot;please check your timetable for times&quot;.&#0160; </p><p>The first and second iterations that I wrote of this code tried to do it all without any tidy step, and it was hard especially because I had to try to parse syntax and parse data in the same step.&#0160; This version is compact enough that it might reasonably be the jumping off point for future enhancements.&#0160; </p><p>still waiting for the bus data to come back....<span style="font-family: Courier;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier;"></span></p>

      </h3>
      <p>While <a href="http://theride.org/SystemDown.asp">waiting for the AATA&#39;s mobile ridetrak system to go back online</a> (it&#39;s been down for two weeks now due to <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2008/12/16/local-groups-scramble-after-ias-eviction/">a series of unfortunate events</a>), I&#39;ve been thinking about how to model the network of bus and pedestrian routes so that you could say some useful things about the goodness of a given route network for a particular task at a particular time of day.&#0160; What I&#39;m after is understanding just how far I can reasonably go from where I am to somewhere else useful based on bus routes, my willingness or ability to walk, and the minute by minute information about how late the bus is.</p><p>Frankly, this is a complex set of questions to answer, especially if you&#39;re unwilling to wait outside for the bus and if you&#39;re willing to ride unfamiliar buses to new destinations.&#0160; Most people figure out how a single route does between two places at two particular times, sorting through the commuter problem and coming up with a rough rule of thumb that depends on the bus being more or less predictably late.&#0160;&#0160; By the time you sort through all of the details to get somewhere new, the bus might have gone by.</p><p>Some observations, numbered, probably requiring each of them to have more details.</p><p>1.&#0160; Always carry a paper schedule.&#0160; If the bus computer system is down again, or your phone is out of battery, a piece of paper no matter how confusing is probably better than nothing.</p><p>2.&#0160; Some places are better to wait than others.&#0160; The cost of being wrong about a bus when you&#39;re at the Blake Transit Center is small, because there&#39;s a warm place to wait and because there are six buses an hour that go to or near enough to my house to be reasonable to get on.&#0160; Contrairiwise, missing a bus by 1 minute on some routes might mean you would wait for an hour (or more).&#0160; </p><p>3.&#0160; Close by stops might really be far away.&#0160; This is a function of pedestrian access - if you need to cross a busy street to get to a stop, it might take two, three, or five minutes to cross between lights and perhaps even a 20 minute hike if you look at the worst pedestrian crossing (Washtenaw at Platt).&#0160; A naive pedestrian distance measure is going to be wrong.</p><p>4.&#0160; All roads lead to downtown.&#0160; With a few exceptions, the Ann Arbor route system is about getting people to the center of Ann Arbor.&#0160; You&#39;ll have a lot better luck getting anywhere if you go downtown first and use it as the base of operations.&#0160;&#0160; I looked at &quot;optimal routes&quot; from home to some places nearby and the best way to get there was a 20+ minute walk, and there are too many destinations where the trip by bus is 40+ minutes for what is a 10 minute drive.&#0160; </p><p>5.&#0160; The University bus system, although frequent, is not integrated with the AATA system.&#0160; This is most notable when you look at Google Transit to plan a trip and notice that it doesn&#39;t ever put you on a UM bus.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Many of the UM buses run frequently enough during my time to use them that no schedule is necessary, but you have to always be prepared to do a transfer of a random, maximum time if you&#39;re switching lines.</p><p>The model that I had in mind for looking at this whole system was to make a big graph, with each node on the graph being a plausible location to be at and the edges being the time to go to the next node.&#0160; There would be a pedestrian network reflecting the sidewalks and bus stops, and a bus network overlaid on top of it where if you were on the bus you could move from node to node but if you weren&#39;t on the bus you&#39;d have to wait.&#0160; Some nodes would be warm (cafes, libraries) and some would be cold and slushy (most bus stops).&#0160; </p><p>This graph becomes the playing board for a big urban game.&#0160; You and all of the other players start at various points on the board, and each minute you take a turn either walking to a next node, staying still where you are, or riding on a bus.&#0160; The winner after 60 turns is the person who managed to get the highest score - whether it be maximum minutes on a bus, maximum distance from origin, maximum distance walking, interesting destinations reached, or any other measure you&#39;d like to score.&#0160; Minus points for wet boots.&#0160; Double minus points for missing the kids pickup from day care.</p><p>As you can see from thinking about this game a little bit, you can play a lot more effectively if you know where all of the buses are.&#0160; Instead of getting negative points for the boot-minutes you spend shivering at the stop, you can accumulate credits indoors until the last minute necessary to get outside.&#0160;&#0160; Knowing that an infrequent bus is close by lets you get bonus points for going to stops that are close by but not often served, and it lets you avoid missed connections where the schedule says you can get from one line to another but you won&#39;t make that connection when the outbound line is late.</p><p>---</p><p>I&#39;m collecting a bunch of links about this on delicious - see <a href="http://delicious.com/vielmetti/where-is-my-fracking-bus">http://delicious.com/vielmetti/where-is-my-fracking-bus</a> for my idiosyncratic collection, and more generally if you are looking at transportation literature a key term is <a href="http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/search.do?new=&amp;b1=9&amp;f1=ht&amp;t1=Automatic+vehicle+location&amp;d=">automatic vehicle location</a>.&#0160;

      </h3>
      <p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">Twitter zero</a>&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar number</a> and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; </p><p>The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again.&#0160; Less of a burden than the accumulated drag of other systems that I had given up on but that still had <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/retrenching-on-web-20-controlling-your-presence-by-turning-off-abandoned-services.html">remnant shards of a previous me</a>, but still a burden.</p><p>As of yesterday I have switched to the &quot;follow everyone who follows you&quot; strategy - as close to strict reciprocity as I can.&#0160; If someone is really awful I&#39;ll block them, but for the most part even the single-threaded marketing droids are bearable if they are mixed in with enough other people.&#0160; At noon Eastern on a Tuesday the front page of my Twitter has 17 minutes worth of stuff in it and I&#39;m about 1/3 of the way through following everyone, so at some point the balance will be &quot;wait five minutes and the front page will have completely changed&quot;.</p><p>This is quite frankly a change from any of my previous tactics and I&#39;m going to be as deliberate about it as I can.&#0160; Here&#39;s a pointless numbered list of iron-clad rules.</p><p>1.&#0160; To keep a conversation going you have to use the @ convention to refer to someone by name, or else the dialog gets lost.&#0160; Twitter stops being a small group extended chat and starts to be some extended group distributed semi-broadcast.&#0160;&#0160; Checking the &quot;replies&quot; tab becomes part of making sure that if there&#39;s a conversation that happened between sessions you can get back to it.&#0160; Every so often you get some little knot of people all online at once going back and forth at each other, but that&#39;s not what you can count on.</p><p>2.&#0160; If you have anything of lasting substance to say, refer to something already written, whether it be a blog post, a delicious tag stream, or something else that is more than 140 characters long.&#0160;&#0160; Everything is scrolling by so fast in this world that if you need to anchor a discussion it can&#39;t be anchored in more and more twitters.&#0160; Blogging becomes more important, not less, in this approach - if it doesn&#39;t fit in one line you have to refer to it somehow.</p><p>3.&#0160; If you play Twitter this way there will always be something more to look at - it&#39;s a never ending game.&#0160; So to keep the time commitment finite and bounded you need to figure out when to stop and just turn it off.&#0160;&#0160; You have to stop some time - figure out how many pages deep in the scroll back you are going to watch, and then quit.&#0160; <strong>If you keep refreshing it will never, ever stop.</strong>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>4.&#0160; As a never ending game the scoring rules clearly change as you play it.&#0160; Various &quot;twitter metrics&quot; have been proposed that mostly boil down to &quot;increase the n&quot;.&#0160; If my earlier explorations are accurate, the counter-tactic of &quot;decrease the n&quot; is just as valuable - going down to zero helped me think about the system carefully.&#0160; I&#39;ve never tried to follow 800+ people before, but I guess now I&#39;ll have a chance to try.&#0160; There&#39;s a stable, winning strategy where the goal is to &quot;<strong>change the n</strong>&quot; - cycle systematically from 0 to max(n) and then back to 0, every day either turning people on or turning people off but never staying the same; the rules of that game are that at every turn you have to change the number of followers you have.</p><p>5.&#0160; People love pointless numbered lists.&#0160; Use them.</p><p>--</p><p>What you lose is the sense of a quiet place where all of your close friends from around town hang out online.&#0160;&#0160; What you gain is some broader sense of the world.&#0160; </p>

      <p>If there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &quot;free&quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&#39;s advertising there sponsoring it.</p><p>With the retrenching in Web 2.0 properties - either sites getting bought up and closed down, abandoned by their new owners, orphaned, or mutated beyond recognition in the search for profit, it&#39;s time to start looking closely at what kinds of remnant &quot;internet presence&quot; I have lurking on the internets and see about turning off anything that&#39;s no longer relevant or up to date.&#0160; Here&#39;s a list of sorts of long-forgotten enthusiasms that should be mercifully excised or republished in some current format.</p><p>Yikes!&#0160;

It&#39;s a relic, and I think I&#39;l keep it as a relic, in part because I used to have a functioning design that had a nice ever-growing ad hoc sidebar full of marginalia and none of the Typepad designs really support that well.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?edward_vielmetti">Edward Vielmetti - Socialtext Customer Exchange</a> - yikes, a wiki.&#0160;

     and their associated gust fronts, in addition to reporting on precipitation

weather radar deployed near 45 of the larger airports in the U.S. The
radars were developed and deployed by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) beginning in 1994, as a response to several
disastrous jetliner crashes in the 1970s and 1980s caused by strong
thunderstorm winds. The crashes occurred because of wind shear--a
sudden change in wind speed and direction. Wind shear is common in
thunderstorms, due to a downward rush of air called a microburst or
downburst. The TDWRs can detect such dangerous wind shear conditions,
and have been instrumental in enhancing aviation safety in the U.S.
over the past 15 years. The TDWRs also measure the same quantities as
our familiar network of 148 NEXRAD WSR-88D Doppler
radars--precipitation intensity, winds, rainfall rate, echo tops, etc.
However, the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radars are higher
resolution, and can &quot;see&quot; details in much finer detail close to the
radar.</p><p>something new to watch as the storms roll in.</p><p></p>

exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new
book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces
around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new
transport system sometime in the next few decades. Specifically, the
book examines how several major processes are shaping the future of how
we travel, including:<br />• Global warming and its many global consequences<br />• Peaking of oil supplies<br />• Increased digitisation of many aspects of economic and social life<br />• Massive global population increases<br />The
authors look at changes in technology, policy, economy and society, and
make a convincing argument for a future where, by necessity, the
present car system will be re-designed and re-engineered. </p><p>Yet
the book also suggests that there are some hugely bleak dilemmas facing
the twenty first century. The authors lay out what they consider to be
possible &#39;post-car&#39; future scenarios. These they describe as &#39;local
sustainability&#39;, &#39;regional warlordism&#39; and &#39;digital networks of
control&#39;. </p><p><em>After The Car</em> will be of great interest to
planners, policy makers, social scientists, futurologists, those
working in industry, as well as general readers.</p><p>Some have
described the 20th Century as the century of the car. Now that century
has come to a close - and things are about to change. </p>

                &quot;Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes&quot;</p><p>
            
Pocket ore docks are monumental structures used to transfer iron ore
from railway cars traveling from nearby mines to ships that carry the
ore to steelmaking centers or transfer points on the Lower Great Lakes.
These structures were constructed from wood, steel, or reinforced
concrete. The twelve pocket docks that remain today are approximately
80 feet in height, 60 feet in width, and range between 900 to 2400 feet
in length. Movable steel chutes project out over the water at a slight
angle from the sides of the docks. The hinged chutes, which when
lowered allow ore to drop into ships from storage bins in the dock, are
located at twelve-foot intervals over the length of the dock and lend a
sense of scale to these massive structures</p><p>
This work will present a survey of the various types of the
gravity-operated pocket docks, from the first wooden dock of 1857 in
Marquette, Michigan to the latest concrete dock of 1944 in Thunder Bay,
Ontario. The work will also present a brief look at the more recent
conveyor-operated shiploading facilities built since 1956. A
description of how pocket docks work and a brief history of the ore
dock on the Great Lakes will be presented. Comparative drawings of
wooden, steel, and concrete docks and shiploaders will be shown. A
photographic survey of the existing docks on the Lakes will be
presented, highlighting current conditions, structural alterations,
removal of components, and threats to their future existence.</p>

I have a bootlegged ASCII text from 1987 published by The Cult of the Dead Cow of Dr. Seuss&#39;s &quot;Cat In The Hat&quot;. It&#39;s perfect to read on my Blackberry. &#0160;I don&#39;t read the preface to the three year old, which reads as follows:</p><p>

his literature. I also enjoy verbally degrading my dog and hyperventilating.<br />
At any rate, this is a great piece of..literature to have and deserves a place<br />

      <p>LONG-LOST OPERATIC FRAGMENT COMES TO LIGHT</p>

<p><p>
During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the
great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering
capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of
their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of
the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe
Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the
Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music
community even this crumbling shard of Verde&#39;s never-performed
Il Internetto.<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Curtain rises. It is night. A storm is gathering over the
battlements of a crumbling red brick office building. In the
background, the houses and lights of a fair but troubled city,
An&#39;Arbro. We hear the rumbling of distant thunder.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Enter Edmundo. He leans on the crenalations and contemplates
the approaching storm.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
Edmundo: Solo mio, vendro unscrupuloso, custombres sansaclu.
(I am all alone, my vendors are of questionable ethics, and my
customers are idiots.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
La Traciata (off): Edmundo! Edmundo!<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Edmundo: Che? (What?)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
La Traciata (entering): Doloroso executivo, executivo perdu,
pite&#39;, pite&#39;, au secours, le boite de multiplexico delenda est.
 (Oh, pitious executive, help, help, the modem is broke.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Small boy (dashing across the stage): Providitore connection,
imbecilico! (Ameritech, idiots!)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>(Off) sound of a news server crashing; alarms and excursions.
<br />
</em>
</p><p>
Don Miguele (entering): Si mentate io, periculoso meo! (If I
had a brain, I&#39;d be dangerous!)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
El Zastrow (drawing a baguette from beneath her chemise): Prends
 ca, compteur de legumes suburbanitico! Mangez le pain de ma

<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Enter four horsemen, Edmundo, Esteban, Owen Glynmorange, and
 Tim the Irascible. They begin to sing an old Provencal round
 consisting of four or five conflicting business plans.<br />
</em>
</p><p>
La Traciata: Ai, yi yi yi yi yi, carriage de corrosion, mi corizon
non di Finisterre. Reimburse&#39; mi. (Alas, my car is a rusting
heap of junk and I cannot afford clothing from Land&#39;s End.
 Sure would be nice to get paid.)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>

loud! Where is that damn gas tank?)<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
Chorus of the busy signals: Bzzz. Bzzz. Bzzz.<br /></p>

<p></p><p>
<em>Night falls. The slain are born away to Valhalla or Ypsilanti.

<p>I have an index card stuck in my copy of Anne Lamott&rsquo;s Bird By
Bird. In that essay, she exhorts the reader to write down
the ideas and thoughts and clever lines of dialog and whatever else
they want to remember on a handy index card (carry one, folded, in
your back pocket so you don&rsquo;t look bulky). I just reread
it out loud to myself, and now I kick myself for not having recorded
myself to listen to it again (not for you all mind you, just for
me).</p>

<p>Bird By Bird is one of my favorite books about writing, and it turns out that it reads really well too - marvelous.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t carry index cards with me all the time - for a while I did,
and now I&rsquo;ve stopped, more or less. That should be fixable,
and the completely inexcusable case where I don&rsquo;t even have a
pen with me is fixable too.</p>

<p>The digital equivalents I have for them are either pages in my
personal wiki (again, not for you, just for me) or posts like this
one in whichever blog seems the most relevant. In
both cases the Socialtext and Typepad support for Blackberry devices
are key to having some reasonable web-based system that&rsquo;s always
available especially when I&#39;m on the bus.</p>

<p>The most fun I&#39;ve seen with index cards as a system has to be

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m doing the shopping these days - a farmer&#39;s market and food coop run on Saturdays, and a Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#39;s run on Sundays.&#0160; Usually I have one or the other of the boys with me, and often there&#39;s some amount of hurry to get the whole process done.</p><p>I&#39;m not used to doing grocery shopping, but going with the boys helps since they have been doing it all along.</p><p>Here&#39;s some ways I seem to manage to get through four shopping experiences a week even though I have famously low shopping tolerance.</p><p>0.&#0160; Work from a list, always.&#0160; Take inventory of your perishables before you buy more perishables; take inventory of your pantry before you refill the pantry.&#0160; We keep a list by the fridge so that when something gets used up that should stay in stock it gets added to for the next round.</p><p>1.&#0160; Shop at farmer&#39;s market first.&#0160; You don&#39;t know what will be a super deal, and what will be in season, and what oddly shaped root vegetable will catch your eye with a farmer who will tell you how to cook it.&#0160; So do that part of the week&#39;s shopping first, and work around it as you do your menu plan.&#0160; </p><p>2.&#0160; Always take the same route through the farmer&#39;s market.&#0160; Mostly the farmers are in the same stalls week after week, or if they move one week they will stay put the next.&#0160; I know where to get onions, garlic, eggs, apples, greens, and herbs, and which places I need to check out but not buy at right away because someone might have a better deal.</p><p>3.&#0160; Do a weekly menu plan, synchronized around your shopping week.&#0160; In our case the farmer&#39;s market is on Saturday and the menu plan gets made on Sunday morning while we eat pancakes, and so we have a good idea of what produce we&#39;re working with and enough time to get all of the supplemental produce and pantry staples on a Sunday shopping to make a week&#39;s worth of meal plans.</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160; Make a list of menu suggestions.&#0160; Keep track of meals that you&#39;ve made and liked, and don&#39;t be afraid to repeat yourself at appropriate intervals or in appropriate seasons.&#0160; When it comes time to plan a week&#39;s meals, you don&#39;t want to start with a blank piece of paper; I find that the two weeks ago menu generally has one or two good ideas for this week for things you aren&#39;t sick of.</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160; Always take the same route through the store, and organize your shopping list according to the store layout.&#0160; That means for our Whole Foods that the order goes vegetables, bulk foods, canned goods, cheese, bread, while at Trader Joes the order is bread, cheese, yogurt, frozen veg, canned goods, snacks.&#0160; You should be able to walk through the store without backtracking to pick up everything you need.</p><p>6.&#0160; Put away your food in the same place every time.&#0160; This might sound silly, but if you keep the beans on the left and the tomatoes on the right always then you can always inventory your tomatoes and know how much you need to buy.&#0160; Randomness is not your friend in the pantry.</p><p>7.&#0160; Get home delivery of as many heavy things as you can.&#0160; We get enough milk to feed two growing boys delivered weekly, and that cuts 25 pounds of weight off the grocery cart.</p><p>A few notes.&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you get most of this process from someone who used to do it all the time and got good at it, even with little kids in tow; left to my own devices I&#39;m much more random.&#0160; Two good mottos to follow are &quot;every meal accounted for&quot; and &quot;no backtracking&quot;.&#0160; The only flaw in my design is the no alcohol before Sunday noon Michigan law, which makes buying beer and wine an exception rather than a regular easy to follow process.&#0160;&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you&#39;re vegetarian and have a big recipe list built up over the years and enough spices in your spice cabinet to get variety from variations on a theme.&#0160; And I still don&#39;t have a middle eastern or Korean grocery in my regular routine, which by rights should happen about 1x/mo each.</p>

	Recreating more or less my original layout, but with 
	dynamically loaded content. I guess that could work!
