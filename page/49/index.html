<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data</li>
</ul>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-23-the-end-of-metblogs/">The end of Metblogs</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
<a href="http://img.metblogs.com/sanjose/files/2008/11/metblogs-logo.jpg" style="float: right;"><img alt="image from img.metblogs.com" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c selected " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c-800wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="image from img.metblogs.com" /></a> <a href="http://www.metblogs.com">Metblogs</a> was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://jpd.me/2010/05/21/metblogs-series-finale/">Metblogs series finale</a>:</p><blockquote>[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May.</blockquote>
The metblogs network never intersected with my world, so I don&#39;t know whether this is just the passing of time or some kind of deep-seated, widely felt loss. Their stats:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://detroit.metblogs.com/">Detroit Metblogs</a>: 2,218 posts / 3,722 comments
</blockquote>
which I have to compare with Vacuum, just to give some sense of scale and scope (since 2003 when I started on Typepad):
<blockquote>
2229 Total Posts, 2033 Total Comments
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s all kinds of business models that have to change with time. I can only say that because I lived through the era when modems ruled the Internet, and then after that when they didn&#39;t. So it&#39;s no failing to have started something that was a good idea at the time and then discover that times have changed and your idea doesn&#39;t have a neat transition to the current day.
</p>

<p>Some parts of the Metblogs network died a bit earlier. This <a href="http://morehockeylesswar.org/blog/archive/2008/06/18/the_death_of_portland_metblogs/">2008 post on the situation in Portland</a> signals what happens when founders intent, advertiser interest, and core contributor passions don&#39;t line up:</p>
<blockquote>
There could still be hope for Metblogs. My suggestions of public journalism, open comments and revenue sharing to attract quality writers were met with hostility when I floated them before. Metblogs could be a voice in the Portland digital media milieu. But most likely it will quietly fade further into irrelevance.</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s their <a href="http://www.metblogs.com/news/2010/05/21/well-that-just-happened/">official going out of business notice</a>. &#0160;Here&#39;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/metblogs/">a feature about them from Wordpress</a>, the platform that they had used.</p>

<p>Noted on Twitter by <a href="http://www.thenetworkthinker.com/">Valdis Krebs</a>, who asks</p>
<blockquote>starting to see the end of the &quot;blog phase&quot; of the Web? Or just the assimilation of another &quot;form&quot; into the whole?</blockquote>

<p>If blogs are being assimilated, what are they being assimilated into? &#0160;If they go into newspapers, you get editors and deadlines and a hesitance to be interested in everything in favor of something narrower and more marketable. If the blogger becomes a diarist, then the novelty is writing for the world but not the form itself. Perhaps some bloggers are just frustrated talk radio hosts? &#0160;There are lots of possibilities to be assimilated into another established media form and not to create some new art form.</p>

<p>Another relevant touchpoint is the end of <a href="http://arborupdate.com">Arbor Update</a>, which closed down after a 6 year run. &#0160;In my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/links-arbor-update-blogroll/">requiem for Arbor Update</a>, I note that it gave up the ghost after many of its contributors who were also regular bloggers stopped blogging regularly. &#0160;This suggests a life cycle for blogging that matches what used to happen on Usenet; a cadre would form, start writing together, and then at some point their lives got busy or they got out of grad school or their public writing style needed to be formal and they left en masse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some epidemic model of when blogging stops, which would say something similar to the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370">Framingham obesity study</a> - when your friends stop blogging, you are likely to stop blogging. &#0160;It&#39;s not that any one thing got in the way; it&#39;s just that the cool kids had a million followers on Twitter, and the eyeballs of the media buyers were diverted toward how you could be more like them. &#0160;Or it may be as simple as not seeing eye to eye with a handful of people who are core to your effort and not being able to restart once they leave.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/">New design</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.</p>
<p>I had to hit &quot;shift-refresh&quot; to force everything to load.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new. &#0160;How few things work that way!</p>
<p>It was especially nice that when I picked a photo to use for the theme, that the system suggested an appropriate accompanying color palette.</p>
<p>Also noted, 5/22/2010: as author, my top navigation bar has an &quot;edit post&quot; button, so I can change things well after the fact. &#0160;This is promising. &#0160;I do notice that there are no archives links anymore and no easy way for anyone to notice that I&#39;ve been plugging away at this for years, but the &quot;search&quot; box is very welcomed, and should unearth some things that would have otherwise been buried.</p>
<p>3/19/11: The design I had picked was &quot;Chroma&quot;. I&#39;ve swapped that out for &quot;Journal Black&quot;, which served to restore the category and archive links. &ndash;Ed</p>
<p>4/24/13: Now using the &quot;Clean&quot; theme, with radically simplified sidebars.</p>

      <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</p>

<p>When you're on with a vision of how something could or should be, that great idea of yours is a liability, not an asset. It's going to take some huge amount of effort or activation of an existing set of skills or knowledge to go from bright idea to something that someone else can buy into. Resist the temptation to let other people have your perspective on the world spelled out to them too clearly before it gets a chance to adapt to circumstances, or at the very least if you are going to do this for someone for money sell them something that captures not just the time spent in that room but the whole world that you bring to making that room reflect reality.</p>

Note that these three are part of a list coming from a world of multiplayer gaming; if you were wondering why your CEO was spending time leveling up in some MMO, now you can see why:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Mobbability</strong>: the ability to do real-time work in very large groups; a tal­ent for coordinating with many people simultaneously.
<strong>Cooperation radar</strong>: the ability to sense, almost intuitively, who would make the best collaborators on a particular task.
<strong>Ping quotient</strong>: measures your responsiveness to other people’s requests for engagement.

      </h3>
      <p>is still worth fighting over, if you and your brother both want it.</p>

<p>What's the smallest piece of lego?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35795&pid=625188&mode=threaded&start=">eurobricks forum</a> suggests it is a flower petal.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.lugnet.com/market/shipping/?n=362">Lugnut</a> says a gold coin, weighing in at just over 0.056 g; the flower petal is a hefty 0.064 g.</p>

<p>For reference, a 1x1 plate is 0.176 g and a 1x8 brick is 3.06 g.</p>

<p>You'll need a lot of legos to build a <a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/lego/mosaics.html">lego mosaic</a>.  I don't even want to thing about the cost of lego bricks per kilogram, or maybe I will; this <a href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/3480-1">package of 25 1x8 bricks has an MSRP of $6</a>, or about $80/kg, or $36/lb.  This discussion on <a href="http://www.classic-space.com/plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?79878">classic-space</a> suggests mixed lego goes for $9-12/lb in 2009 dollars.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.</p><p>In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. &#0160;This blog has a &quot;garlic mustard&quot; tag, which signals that I should write about that at least once a year; without that reminder, somehow I might miss that opportunity to refresh that annual recipe opportunity. &#0160; The category list is long, but finite, and it&#39;s idiosyncratic to reflect some peculiar sense of evolved focus.</p><p>Tags are much harder, especially in a world of tags shared across a team. &#0160;There are enough variant spellings and punctuation in an 8000 unit tag cloud to make it tough to see which of those tags are most useful. &#0160;Perhaps I can carve out 20 or 30 to make my own, items to revisit repeatedly, but the system as a system does not constrain me as such.</p><p>It&#39;s very useful to have a bucket that can be usefully refilled periodically. &#0160;At the cycle of once per year, the cumulative knowledge of paczki rituals or cudighi recipes makes each successive year easier. &#0160;Monthly rituals leave room to breathe between attempts, and weekly cycles build up a substantial body of work in just a year. &#0160;</p><p>In many ways this is the mindless mindfulness approach to sustained productivity; don&#39;t decide what of 1000s of things you might do, simply have one picked for you and then go at it with a strict deadline to get you to where you need to go until the next time. &#0160;The effort can be impromptu and doesn&#39;t require much explicit preparation, since you&#39;ve primed the pump with previous work. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.</p>
<p>Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted.</p>
<p>Progress is a hard thing to measure with any degree of certainty. &#0160;&quot;Increase the n&quot; is one typical useful task, as though by heaping on one more of whatever it is that you are counting you can get one measure closer to ultimate success. &#0160;&quot;Decrease the n&quot; is the other task, which generally for me is the Sisyphian task of emptying the inbox or washing the dishes. &#0160;You&#39;re never really done, and the only progress you note is that something happened today.</p>
<p>The meaningless indicator of progress can simply be the recognition that you have hit some temporary and attainable local high point to the day, and that even if tomorrow brings you back to a spot where you need to do more, you at least did what you needed to do today. &#0160;Shining the sink is the domestic equivalent of inbox zero; yes, there still may be more to do tomorrow, but at least for today you&#39;re at the bottom of what needs to be done.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.</p>

<p>I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz. So off it goes, at least for now. Let Twitter be Twitter.</p>

<p>I suspect that blog-related stuff should land here, since there's at least some pretense that it should be longer. I almost wish there was a one-pass "post this to my blog too"; indeed, the first draft of this was written in Buzz, until I figured that it really should be posted to Vacuum and then pulled into Buzz through the feed. I guess. I hope that works.</p>

<p>It's always nice to try out some new communications system, especially one that makes you rethink your use of all of the old systems you had gotten out of the habit of using. I've also liked which random people from my address book that Google decided should be my first set of friends; they did a pretty good job.</p>

<br>
Upon this age, that never speaks its mind,<br>
This furtive age, this age endowed with power<br>
To wake the moon with footsteps, fit an oar<br>
Into the rowlocks of the wind, and find<br>
What swims before his prow, what swirls behind &mdash;<br>
Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,<br>
Rains from the sky a meteoric shower<br>
Of facts &hellip; they lie unquestioned, uncombined.<br>
Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill<br>
Is daily spun; but there exists no loom<br>
To weave it into fabric; undefiled<br>
Proceeds pure Science, and has her say; but still<br>
Upon this world from the collective womb<br>
Is spewed all day the red triumphant child.<br>

      <p>The Checklist Manifesto; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/books/24book.html">review</a> in the New York Times.</p>

<p></p><h4>THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO</h4><h5>How to Get Things Right</h5><p>Atul Gawande</p>

<p>Excerpt from Freakonomics review</p>
<blockquote>
Even more interesting are the stories about Walmart’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the real reason why David Lee Roth used to demand that there be a bowl of M&amp;M’s with all the brown ones removed in his dressing room backstage.</blockquote>

<p>Times Online <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article6995508.ece">review</a></p>

<blockquote>The surgeon-author was on the track of what might be described as a classic magic bullet — a low-tech way in a high-tech, expensive world in which lives might be saved and costs reduced. Gawande, using his own word, was searching for “eptitude” — the business of making sure that those with knowledge applied it effectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following checklist is designed to aid the checklist creation process and ensure that your checklist helps instead of hurts. &#0160;It was created by Dr. Atul Gawande, the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health Dissemination Team, and Dan Boorman of Boeing.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The nicest wiki implementation of checklists I&#39;ve seen is at Sunshine Review, using the MediaWiki dpl extension.</p>

<p>Another review, in <a href="https://www.indiacurrents.com/articles/2010/06/04/from-ignorance-to-ineptitude-to-eptitude">India Currents</a> 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But does novelty really matter when lives are at stake? In a
recent New York Times article about implementing checklists, Dr.
Peter Pronovost (whose contribution Gawande  acknowledges) exclaimed
that “You would have thought I started World War III.” He then
asserted that having nurses check to ensure that doctors washed
their hands has “gotten infection rates down to almost zero in the
ICU.” With success like that, patients are probably saying, “Thank
you very much, Dr. Gawande. Your manifesto may not be War and Peace,
but it has saved more lives than Tolstoy’s novel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pronovost is interviewed in a Wall Street Journal article,
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576131963185893084">The Secret to Fighting Infections</a>,
from 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pronovost&rsquo;s boyish appearance and enthusiastic manner belie a steely determination to challenge the status quo in medicine. He hasn&rsquo;t shied away from criticizing his peers for resisting safety and quality improvement efforts, a theme of his 2009 book &ldquo;Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><span class="il">Networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span>: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, <strong>James Whitacre</strong> and <strong>Axel Bender</strong>, 2009/12/10, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1961">arXiv:0912.1961</a></p><blockquote><p>Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called <span class="il">networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span> hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.</p></blockquote><p>Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&#39;s my interpretation.&#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.</p><p>The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are <strong>flexible and reconfigurable</strong> (&quot;versatile&quot;).&#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.</p><p>The second note is the that the agents are <strong>diverse</strong> (oddly, in this language, &quot;degenerate&quot;) in their skills.&#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&#0160; </p><p>Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&#0160;&#0160; For any individual task, there&#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&#0160; </p><p>I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&#0160; I haven&#39;t even made sense yet of the &quot;network buffering&quot; piece.&#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.</p><p></p>
