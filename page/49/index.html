<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>You are given a day to produce something of interest. How much of that time should be spend reading, and how much time should be spent writing?</p>
<p>There is a good argument to be made that you want to minimize your research budget and maximize the number of words produced. It&#39;s hard to be a productive writer when the time is spent in the inbox deleting mail or on the net looking aimlessly for something of interest, for neither mode lends itself to long stretches of concentrated thought. Rather, you start work by working, and do the research as you need to extend the story.</p>
<p>If you are going to spent time reading before you start typing, the sensible thing would be to open up the page and begin to write first, and only then let the triggers in your text lead you to temporary search distractions. If you can corral your enthusiasm for wandering around the net enough that you can be focused more on what is in your own head and less on what is trying to catch your attention, it will be easier to produce something useful.</p>
<p>There is a type of writing that I find myself doing perhaps too frequently where every sentence has a link to something. I am not sure how this can be anything but slow to put together, since there&#39;s a substantial and ongoing risk of distraction that you are participating in as well as inviting your reader to participate in.</p>
<p>The simplistic perspective is simply to say that hyperlinks subvert storytelling.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Walker, surrounded by extra security at the state Capitol, revealed a long-planned contingency to call in the National Guard against state workers in the event of strikes or protests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last time that the Wisconsin National Guard was called in for a labor dispute was the 1934 Kohler Strike. The <a href="http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=1529" target="_self">Sheboygan Press covered the strike in 1934</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relatively peaceful strike took a violent turn on July 27th (1934) when special deputies broke through the picket lines to escort a coal car that strikers had turned back. A battle ensued outside the plant that left two strikers dead and over 40 wounded. The next day, Governor Schmedeman called out the National Guard to restore order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s why, when I was in the throngs of rank-and-file workers, I was hearing “tax the rich.” People were comparing Scott Walker to the U.S.-backed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was forced to resign last week after 18 days of protest. They are calling him “Hosni Walker” because only dictators side with the tiny minority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Washington Post columnist Harold Meyerson refers to Walker as the&#0160;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/15/AR2011021504339.html?nav=emailpage" target="_self">cheesehead pharaoh of the Middle West.&#0160;</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a throwback to 19th-century America, when strikes were suppressed by force of arms. Or, come to think of it, to Mubarak&#39;s Egypt or communist Poland and East Germany.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The quake, or cryoseism as it’s known in scientific circles, occurs when moisture soaks into the soil and a quick freeze causes a sudden, even violent expansion and contraction. Darke County’s 911 director Brandon Redmond said the quakes erupted for eight hours Thursday, starting at 1 a.m. The heaviest reports were between 5:30-7:30 a.m.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>The group of quakes, which are caused by fast freezing of water-saturated soils or rocks at abrupt drop of winter temperatures often occurring in the middle and high latitudes of Eurasia, is considered. The review of little-known literature is given; the statistical data on the distribution of earthquakes in seasons and the time of day in various regions of Eurasia are presented. Special attention is paid to the East European Platform; using the data for this platform, with thorough consideration of reference quakes along with the weather conditions, the signs of a specific class of nontectonic seismic events are determined. The question concerning the necessity of the frost quakes’ discrimination in compilation of tectonic earthquake catalogues in certain regions is stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>At 22:34 UTC (00:34am local time), Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet&#39;s global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt&#39;s service providers. Virtually all of Egypt&#39;s Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide.</p>

      <p>The video, entitled "It is pitch dark", from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster <a href="http://frontalot.com/">MC Frontalot</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://frontalot.com/index.php/?page=lyrics&amp;lyricid=47">lyrics</a>, in part:</p>
<blockquote>You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory.</blockquote>
<p>What is a grue?</p>
<blockquote>The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2183381">More on "Grue" and Grue</a>, The Philosophical Review © 1961 Duke University Press.  
<blockquote>Mr. Grue believes that grass is grue, taken here to mean that it is green until the year 2000 and blue afterward.</blockquote>
Grue is the color of the y2k problem - green (providing riches) until the year 2000, and blue (providing sadness) afterwards.  Noted here, as <a href="http://www.commercialventvac.com/y2k.html">The Year 2000 Crisis: One software engineers' perspective"</a>:
<blockquote>
This is not a new problem.  There is a paradox, called "Goodman's Grue-Bleen paradox", which describes what we're facing.  See The fall 1983 issue of the Bulletin of the Santayana Society, "on Grue and Bleen", by  Angus Kerr-Lawson.  See also Goodman's Paradox.  In the paradox, an object is "grue" if it is green between a certain time, T, and blue after T.  An object is "bleen" if it is blue before T, and green after T.  The paradox is how to tell the difference between something which is green and something which is grue.  At the moment, it is impossible to know.  After T, it will be easy.  Similarly, it is easy to tell the difference between something which is green and something which is bleen.  But after T, it might not be.  Further, any system built on distingushing between green and blue will work properly now with green, blue, and bleen objects, but will fail after time T. 
</blockquote>
Is there a relationship between the "grue" of Zork and the "grue" of the color paradox?

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-18-task-sandwich-activity-tracker-in-google-spreadsheet/">daily aliquot of love</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A very brief writeup of a technique for doing online task management, in a world where there are so many social media channels that you need a spreadsheet to keep track of them all.</p>
<p>The software is Google Spreadsheet, used with a private sheet all for myself.</p>
<p>The structure of the worksheet is a set of columns, with column headings indicating the piece of software, online system, or media channel that you are tracking; the rows are dated or time stamped.</p>
<p>Each cell has a brief summary of events, activities, or other goings-on for that channel at that time. &quot;Birthday deals&quot; is my notation from Facebook for Jan 5, 2011, noting that on that day I wished people a happy birthday by sending them the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Arborwiki birthday deals page</a> (my customary greeting card). Keep it short, down to a name, a keyword, a tag, or anything else minimal.</p>
<p>The key technique is hyperlinking each of these (column header and activity cell) where possible, so that you can go back and re-animate your activity on a minimum notice. The syntax is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=hyperlink(URL,&quot;text&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is simple enough to make it not be a big deal to do.</p>
<p>The locus of activity moves. Rather than opening a new window, looking for page changes to the more frequent sites that you visit, and hoping mindlessly that there&#39;s something new, the unit of online activity becomes working your way across the columns and methodically filling in each of them with a daily aliquot of love.</p>
<p>The challenge is getting the column headers right, so that you focus on the correct systems, and ignore the irrelevant ones.</p>
<p>Why do I call it task sandwich? Darned if I know, that&#39;s what got typed in.</p>

Digital photography was new then, and special, and there was some first flush of enthusiasm for having a system that &quot;got it&quot;.</p>
<p>Time and space happened, and Flickr became part of Yahoo. A piece of the fun drained out, and the Internet got bigger. Digital photography got more ordinary, and the camera I carry around everywhere felt more and more like a crappy camera and not like something I could capture the essence of the world with.</p>
<p>I&#39;m at a point where I could easily take a photograph every day and send it somewhere. Should Flickr be that place? Will the time come not too soon when I will want to be a refugee from it, downloading my photos in the hopes that I can re-upload them somewhere else, tags and annotations intact and some fragment of society reconstructed around them?</p>
<p>I loved Flickr once, in the way that I&#39;m sure that people once loved Compuserve. There is still a Game Neverending to play with photographs, but I don&#39;t know yet where to play that game.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>For future reference, since I end up immediately thinking of Veblen when I read about <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/scharffenberger-tofu.html" target="_self">artisanal tofu</a>. This from Theory of the Leisure Class is on hand-made goods (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place assigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point of material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought goods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former serve their primary purpose more adequately. They are a more perfect product—show a more perfect adaptation of means to end. This does not save them from disesteem and deprecation, for they fall short under the test of honorific waste. <em>Hand labor is a more wasteful method of production; hence the goods turned out by this method are more serviceable for the purpose of pecuniary reputability; hence the marks of hand labor come to be honorific, and the goods which exhibit these marks take rank as of higher grade than the corresponding machine product. </em>Commonly, if not invariably, the honorific marks of hand labor are certain imperfections and irregularities in the lines of the hand-wrought article, showing where the workman has fallen short in the execution of the design. The ground of the superiority of hand-wrought goods, therefore, is a certain margin of crudeness. This margin must never be so wide as to show bungling workmanship, since that would be evidence of low cost, nor so narrow as to suggest the ideal precision attained only by the machine, for that would be evidence of low cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/833/833-h/833-h.htm" target="_self">Gutenberg edition of Theory of the Leisure Class</a>&#0160;is a convenient edition, since it&#39;s all on one page; it also has those honorific marks of hand labor, including exhortations at the end to give the reader &quot;Plain Vanilla ASCII&quot; upon request.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, of course, the details of the relationship between man and machine also change. Goods produced on an old machine, ideally one for which parts cannot be obtained except by manufacturing them yourself, obtain the high status of handmade goods. The more obscure the equipment, the better, and imperfections in old equipment provide the same &quot;honorific marks&quot; of handmade goods.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup.</p>
<p>The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere.</p>
<p>The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food.</p>
<p>What I was really after, and what I found readily (since 34 people have bookmarked it on pinboard) was Malcolm Gladwell's 2004 <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_09_06_a_ketchup.html" target="_self">The Ketchup Conundrum</a>. After finding that, I readily found Meg Favreau's <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article07290902.aspx" target="_self">Playing Ketchup</a>&nbsp;and Johan Lehrer's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/08/ketchup.php" target="_self">Ketchup</a> from The Frontal Cortex.</p>
<p>As for recipes (other than "buy a bottle of Heinz"), try</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jamie-oliver/homemade-tomato-ketchup-recipe/index.html" target="_self">Jamie Oliver's homemade ketchup</a></li>
<li>(your suggestion goes here)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my search strategies in finding things that I had previously known about is to search for them with my name attached, e.g. a search for "vielmetti ketchup". This is less about ego and more about retrieval; you can do the same with your favorite prolific blogger or news source ("kottke ketchup" generates an equally interesting set).</p>
<p>I wonder if you've been getting enough ketchup.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/" target="_self">scuttlebutt</a> is that delicious is going to be <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bpm140/status/15473591558602752" target="_self">axed</a> by Yahoo.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.</p>
<p>Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it. Sometimes these were straightforward tags, like the 1533 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/annarbor" target="_self">annarbor</a>&quot;. Others were idiosyncratic, like the 5 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/attention-to-irrelevant-details" target="_self">attention-to-irrelevant-details</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>There are other, better ways to bookmark things so that lots of people see them. The facebook &quot;like&quot; button gets more page views without consuming any <a href="http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0098.html" target="_self">cognitive overhead</a> about how to tag, whether to tag, and what you&#39;ve tagged before. Actually writing about something is quite a bit better than just bookmarking it, because you get to be yourself for a little while and not just an automaton forwarding on links automatically.</p>
<p>Every bookmark I ever did on delicious, up until now, is archived for posterity here:&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm" target="_self">vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm</a>&#0160;. As I review it, there really should have been more of them marked &quot;attention to irrelevant details&quot;. It&#39;s hours of reading, though some of it goes by fast because the site that was linked to has disappeared, leaving only the bookmark and whatever clipping I managed to care about.</p>
<p>edit: now with more cognitive overhead</p>
<p>more delicious:</p>

      <p><p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a cheaper way to clean a dishwasher than to put heavily marketed, sugary &ldquo;breakfast drink&rdquo; powder into it. Tang is citric acid and sweetener and artificial flavor that tastes like moon rocks.</p>
<p>The dishwasher is cleaner, though, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Other suggestions for cleaners include vinegar, straight citric acid, borax, and baking soda. None of those have the astronaut cachet.</p>

      <p>An old, old recipe to keep your feet warm: sprinkle cayenne in your socks. &#0160;</p>

<p>The powdered capsicum slightly dusted in the socks of persons subject to cold feet will generally prove a salutary means of overpowering that unpleasant sensation.

      <p>A much-beloved but seedy local landmark will close, with developers planning to build a shiny hi-rise on the location.
