<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      <p>I used this phrase in my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/03/meaningless-indicators-of-progress.html">meaningless indicators of progress</a> post.</p>

<p>Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context:</p>

<p>Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Art-of-Living-Mindfully/63292/?sid=at">The Art of Living Mindfully</a> on the work of <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/">Ellen Langer</a>. Her <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/blog/">blog</a> is not frequent but it is thoughtful.</p>

<blockquote>
We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless. We have been taught absolutes when none really exist independent of context. When we think we know something absolutely, we have learned that it is reasonable never to question it, nor to pay attention to how it may be otherwise. Beliefs and behavior always make some kind of sense from the actor’s perspective or else the actor would have done otherwise. Blame suggests mindlessness on the part of the blamer who does not recognize this. We are not at fault for what we do not know just because someone else can see a way we could have known it.
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1550775">Just Breathe: Meditation as Organizational Slack</a> is a paper by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kaisa-holloway-cripps/3/ba7/b62">Kaisa G. Holloway Cripps</a>. &#0160;Mostly a literature review, it looks at meditation inside an organization and identifies ways where it may be useful to engage human resources that are slack. &#0160;The discussion reminds me of MBA consultants who work like dogs for months and then are periodically &quot;on the beach&quot; for a while when their gig is up.</p>

<p>I quickly hit Buddhism when I look up this phrase, the parts of Buddhism that I haven&#39;t lived close enough to that I appreciate all of the subtleties of the words.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>We measure things that are easy to measure about media, like</p><ul>
<li>time on page, time on site
</li>
<li>click through rate
</li>
<li>conversion rate to some desired action
</li>
<li>frequency of interaction
</li>
<li>responsiveness of interaction
</li>
<li>hot spots that are getting lots of attention
</li>
<li>&quot;lag&quot;, whatever that is, but everyone knows what it is
</li>
</ul>

In general, media that have small amounts of lag are good for gaming, because you can play many small bets and iteratively define a better result. As the amount of lag increases, the attention games change, and you start to get out of the realm of reality-based feedback and into the realm of ROI fictions, and systems that have enormous expensive command and
control infrastructures.&#0160;
<p>It’s one thing to hack people’s attention about tomorrow if you start working on it today, and something very different to plan a campaign that results in their attention (or the fulfillment of their desire) 6 or 12 or 18 or 120 months hence.&#0160;</p><p>Originally written for <a href="http://twitter.com/kevindoylejones">Kevin Doyle Jones</a>, and published obscurely in 2007; rescued and republished with only minor edits 3 years hence.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m trying to figure out how to retell stories about a place that I only know a little about. &#0160;The particular spot is a <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Clague&#39;s_Grocery">one time grocery store</a>, now a bicycle shop, that I am guessing was a center of a neighborhood in its time. If there ever was a lore around it, it circulates among a group of people who I don&#39;t know. &#0160;The owner of the store was notable in his day, but that day is about 60 years ago.</p><p>My usual routine is to find an interesting idea, do searches in unexpected locations that get uncommon results, and assemble a story from clippings of things already written. &#0160;This can be a fast way of going from scattered and fragmentary information about something to a composed account that makes sense. Clippings are easy to assemble, someone else has done the work, and you can sit down and be done when you&#39;re done.</p><p>What&#39;s harder for me is to write about something that no one else has written down, especially something which you in turn have only limited knowledge of. &#0160;The quotable information from print sources may be locked up in materials that are not scanned in, and perhaps never scanned in unless you scan them in yourself - that is, if you can find anything at all. &#0160;The real stories of how things were might only be tellable if you can locate someone to tell them to you and if you write the stories down carefully for them.</p><p>If you are interested in something and want to publish something about it to mark that interest, you might end up with only a fragment to start. &#0160;There are some media where it&#39;s acceptable to tell a piece of a story that&#39;s an incomplete image, but only a very few. &#0160;&quot;That&#39;s not news&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s your point&quot; are typical reactions when a newspaper behaves that way. &#0160;The encyclopedia&#39;s defense mechanism says &quot;that&#39;s not notable&quot;. &quot;Too long, didn&#39;t read&quot; is the reaction in the blog world. &#0160;So you need some place to dump fragments that don&#39;t have to be complete that&#39;s safe so when it comes time to tell a story you can extend your memory.</p><p>Nothing gets around the problem that the real stories can only be told by people. &#0160;That&#39;s an opportunity and a challenge.</p><p></p>

      <p>I have a shiny phone with more computing power than the first computer I ever owned. &#0160;I also have a shiny brick, because the phone isn&#39;t working now, and when I took it back to where I bought it they gave me a phone number to call to fix it. &#0160;(I call it my BrickBerry. &#0160;It&#39;s so bricked, it doesn&#39;t even play Brickout.) There&#39;s nothing worse than talking on the phone, trying to fix your phone.</p>

<blockquote>
You can either call Toll Free # 1-800-937-8997 or we here in Technical Care web chat can assist you.</blockquote>I am tempted to go back to the worst possible phone that could possibly work. &#0160;I had an old, old Nokia candybar-style phone, which at one point I called my &quot;WAP phone&quot; because I had to wap on the side of it to get it to work. &#0160;Yet it did work, and it made lots of phone calls, and it seemed cheap at the time. &#0160;And it was cheap - it had a monochrome screen, only the most rudimentary games, no camera, nothing. &#0160;Cheap but reliable. &#0160;

<blockquote>JVM Error 517</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/search.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=KB10875">An unrecoverable error on the phone.</a></blockquote><blockquote>T-mobile policy for this error is to ship a replacement phone.</blockquote>

<p>Smart phones aren&#39;t cheap, but increasingly they don&#39;t seem all that smart either. &#0160;Shiny, yes; futuristic and wonderful, sure. &#0160;But smart, not so much. &#0160;Does your phone remind you of what you need to do, when and where you need to do it, but not so naggingly that you turn it off? &#0160;Probably not. &#0160;Does that smart phone make you look smarter when you&#39;re walking down the street punching buttons on it? &#0160;Not so sure. <a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/status/5560837946">Twittering from the bus to let the planet know which bus has squeaky brakes?</a> &#0160;Uh huh.</p><p>The trap, perhaps, is confusing &quot;smart phone&quot; with &quot;smart person&quot;. &#0160;Does a smart phone make you smart?</p>

<p>One possibility is to ditch phones with contracts entirely and go to a prepaid plan, which means that every call would cost something and I&#39;ve have to be smart about how to use my phone. &#0160;That turns out to be easier now that I have Google Voice, which gives me more tools than ever to not answer my phone but still get a message to me. &#0160;Google Voice lets me direct any call to any phone, and thus the cell phone simply becomes another selectable destination to originate or terminate calls on the same number.</p>

      <p>
<a href="http://img.metblogs.com/sanjose/files/2008/11/metblogs-logo.jpg" style="float: right;"><img alt="image from img.metblogs.com" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c selected " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c-800wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="image from img.metblogs.com" /></a> <a href="http://www.metblogs.com">Metblogs</a> was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://jpd.me/2010/05/21/metblogs-series-finale/">Metblogs series finale</a>:</p><blockquote>[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May.</blockquote>
The metblogs network never intersected with my world, so I don&#39;t know whether this is just the passing of time or some kind of deep-seated, widely felt loss. Their stats:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://detroit.metblogs.com/">Detroit Metblogs</a>: 2,218 posts / 3,722 comments
</blockquote>
which I have to compare with Vacuum, just to give some sense of scale and scope (since 2003 when I started on Typepad):
<blockquote>
2229 Total Posts, 2033 Total Comments
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s all kinds of business models that have to change with time. I can only say that because I lived through the era when modems ruled the Internet, and then after that when they didn&#39;t. So it&#39;s no failing to have started something that was a good idea at the time and then discover that times have changed and your idea doesn&#39;t have a neat transition to the current day.
</p>

<p>Some parts of the Metblogs network died a bit earlier. This <a href="http://morehockeylesswar.org/blog/archive/2008/06/18/the_death_of_portland_metblogs/">2008 post on the situation in Portland</a> signals what happens when founders intent, advertiser interest, and core contributor passions don&#39;t line up:</p>
<blockquote>
There could still be hope for Metblogs. My suggestions of public journalism, open comments and revenue sharing to attract quality writers were met with hostility when I floated them before. Metblogs could be a voice in the Portland digital media milieu. But most likely it will quietly fade further into irrelevance.</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s their <a href="http://www.metblogs.com/news/2010/05/21/well-that-just-happened/">official going out of business notice</a>. &#0160;Here&#39;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/metblogs/">a feature about them from Wordpress</a>, the platform that they had used.</p>

<p>Noted on Twitter by <a href="http://www.thenetworkthinker.com/">Valdis Krebs</a>, who asks</p>
<blockquote>starting to see the end of the &quot;blog phase&quot; of the Web? Or just the assimilation of another &quot;form&quot; into the whole?</blockquote>

<p>If blogs are being assimilated, what are they being assimilated into? &#0160;If they go into newspapers, you get editors and deadlines and a hesitance to be interested in everything in favor of something narrower and more marketable. If the blogger becomes a diarist, then the novelty is writing for the world but not the form itself. Perhaps some bloggers are just frustrated talk radio hosts? &#0160;There are lots of possibilities to be assimilated into another established media form and not to create some new art form.</p>

<p>Another relevant touchpoint is the end of <a href="http://arborupdate.com">Arbor Update</a>, which closed down after a 6 year run. &#0160;In my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/links-arbor-update-blogroll/">requiem for Arbor Update</a>, I note that it gave up the ghost after many of its contributors who were also regular bloggers stopped blogging regularly. &#0160;This suggests a life cycle for blogging that matches what used to happen on Usenet; a cadre would form, start writing together, and then at some point their lives got busy or they got out of grad school or their public writing style needed to be formal and they left en masse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some epidemic model of when blogging stops, which would say something similar to the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370">Framingham obesity study</a> - when your friends stop blogging, you are likely to stop blogging. &#0160;It&#39;s not that any one thing got in the way; it&#39;s just that the cool kids had a million followers on Twitter, and the eyeballs of the media buyers were diverted toward how you could be more like them. &#0160;Or it may be as simple as not seeing eye to eye with a handful of people who are core to your effort and not being able to restart once they leave.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.</p>
<p>I had to hit &quot;shift-refresh&quot; to force everything to load.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new. &#0160;How few things work that way!</p>
<p>It was especially nice that when I picked a photo to use for the theme, that the system suggested an appropriate accompanying color palette.</p>
<p>Also noted, 5/22/2010: as author, my top navigation bar has an &quot;edit post&quot; button, so I can change things well after the fact. &#0160;This is promising. &#0160;I do notice that there are no archives links anymore and no easy way for anyone to notice that I&#39;ve been plugging away at this for years, but the &quot;search&quot; box is very welcomed, and should unearth some things that would have otherwise been buried.</p>
<p>3/19/11: The design I had picked was &quot;Chroma&quot;. I&#39;ve swapped that out for &quot;Journal Black&quot;, which served to restore the category and archive links. --Ed</p>
<p>4/24/13: Now using the &quot;Clean&quot; theme, with radically simplified sidebars.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</p>

<p>When you're on with a vision of how something could or should be, that great idea of yours is a liability, not an asset. It's going to take some huge amount of effort or activation of an existing set of skills or knowledge to go from bright idea to something that someone else can buy into. Resist the temptation to let other people have your perspective on the world spelled out to them too clearly before it gets a chance to adapt to circumstances, or at the very least if you are going to do this for someone for money sell them something that captures not just the time spent in that room but the whole world that you bring to making that room reflect reality.</p>

<strong>Mobbability</strong>: the ability to do real-time work in very large groups; a tal­ent for coordinating with many people simultaneously.

      <p>is still worth fighting over, if you and your brother both want it.</p>

<p>What's the smallest piece of lego?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35795&pid=625188&mode=threaded&start=">eurobricks forum</a> suggests it is a flower petal.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.lugnet.com/market/shipping/?n=362">Lugnut</a> says a gold coin, weighing in at just over 0.056 g; the flower petal is a hefty 0.064 g.</p>

<p>For reference, a 1x1 plate is 0.176 g and a 1x8 brick is 3.06 g.</p>

<p>You'll need a lot of legos to build a <a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/lego/mosaics.html">lego mosaic</a>.  I don't even want to thing about the cost of lego bricks per kilogram, or maybe I will; this <a href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/3480-1">package of 25 1x8 bricks has an MSRP of $6</a>, or about $80/kg, or $36/lb.  This discussion on <a href="http://www.classic-space.com/plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?79878">classic-space</a> suggests mixed lego goes for $9-12/lb in 2009 dollars.</p>

      <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.</p><p>In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. &#0160;This blog has a &quot;garlic mustard&quot; tag, which signals that I should write about that at least once a year; without that reminder, somehow I might miss that opportunity to refresh that annual recipe opportunity. &#0160; The category list is long, but finite, and it&#39;s idiosyncratic to reflect some peculiar sense of evolved focus.</p><p>Tags are much harder, especially in a world of tags shared across a team. &#0160;There are enough variant spellings and punctuation in an 8000 unit tag cloud to make it tough to see which of those tags are most useful. &#0160;Perhaps I can carve out 20 or 30 to make my own, items to revisit repeatedly, but the system as a system does not constrain me as such.</p><p>It&#39;s very useful to have a bucket that can be usefully refilled periodically. &#0160;At the cycle of once per year, the cumulative knowledge of paczki rituals or cudighi recipes makes each successive year easier. &#0160;Monthly rituals leave room to breathe between attempts, and weekly cycles build up a substantial body of work in just a year. &#0160;</p><p>In many ways this is the mindless mindfulness approach to sustained productivity; don&#39;t decide what of 1000s of things you might do, simply have one picked for you and then go at it with a strict deadline to get you to where you need to go until the next time. &#0160;The effort can be impromptu and doesn&#39;t require much explicit preparation, since you&#39;ve primed the pump with previous work. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.</p>
<p>Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted.</p>
<p>Progress is a hard thing to measure with any degree of certainty. &#0160;&quot;Increase the n&quot; is one typical useful task, as though by heaping on one more of whatever it is that you are counting you can get one measure closer to ultimate success. &#0160;&quot;Decrease the n&quot; is the other task, which generally for me is the Sisyphian task of emptying the inbox or washing the dishes. &#0160;You&#39;re never really done, and the only progress you note is that something happened today.</p>
<p>The meaningless indicator of progress can simply be the recognition that you have hit some temporary and attainable local high point to the day, and that even if tomorrow brings you back to a spot where you need to do more, you at least did what you needed to do today. &#0160;Shining the sink is the domestic equivalent of inbox zero; yes, there still may be more to do tomorrow, but at least for today you&#39;re at the bottom of what needs to be done.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I put in an application for <a href="http://www.igniteannarbor.com/">Ignite 3 Ann Arbor</a>.  5 minutes, 20 slides.  The working structure for the talk is the 5 minute or so talk I give at the beginning of every a2b3 meeting, with the little ritual introduction of the group and the origin story and the monologue.  I think it will work out; heaven knows that I've had some practice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.</p>

<p>I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz. So off it goes, at least for now. Let Twitter be Twitter.</p>

<p>I suspect that blog-related stuff should land here, since there's at least some pretense that it should be longer. I almost wish there was a one-pass "post this to my blog too"; indeed, the first draft of this was written in Buzz, until I figured that it really should be posted to Vacuum and then pulled into Buzz through the feed. I guess. I hope that works.</p>

<p>It's always nice to try out some new communications system, especially one that makes you rethink your use of all of the old systems you had gotten out of the habit of using. I've also liked which random people from my address book that Google decided should be my first set of friends; they did a pretty good job.</p>

      <p><strong>Edna St. Vincent Millay: This Gifted Age<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Upon this age, that never speaks its mind,<br>
This furtive age, this age endowed with power<br>
To wake the moon with footsteps, fit an oar<br>
Into the rowlocks of the wind, and find<br>
What swims before his prow, what swirls behind &mdash;<br>
Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,<br>
Rains from the sky a meteoric shower<br>
Of facts &hellip; they lie unquestioned, uncombined.<br>
Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill<br>
Is daily spun; but there exists no loom<br>
To weave it into fabric; undefiled<br>
Proceeds pure Science, and has her say; but still<br>
Upon this world from the collective womb<br>
Is spewed all day the red triumphant child.<br>

      </h3>
      <p>I've changed the title of this blog back to Vacuum, since all of the extra gobbledygook was making it hard to bookmark things.</p>
<p>The "quick compose" part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don't have titles, so I don't get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type.  Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be more regular about dumping something into this input box when things warrant, generally late at night.</p>
