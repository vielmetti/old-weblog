<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p><em>What&#39;s brown and sticky? &#0160;A stick.</em><p>One of my favorite parts of the Huron River, strange as it may seem, is the mill race downstream of Argo Dam. &#0160;It&#39;s utterly unloved, used for recreation only as a canoe portage.</p><p>M. and I went to the spillway that connects this mill race with the Huron, just upstream of the Detroit Edison Argo Substation. &#0160;There was a lot of trash - sticks, logs, aquatic weeds of various kinds, the odd can and bottle - clogging the spillway. &#0160;I brought two old cross-country ski poles, and we went stick fishing. &#0160; The object is to catch a stick and then pull it so it goes over the spillway. &#0160;</p><p>Both ends of the ski pole are useful. &#0160;The pointy end is better for poking and pulling. &#0160;The grip end has a loop to secure your hand in which can be used to snag a branch. &#0160;If you twist the loop you get a secure hold and can pull just about anything.</p><p>When we were done stick fishing, most of the spillway was free of brush and weeds.</p><p>We did see one couple who had caught some bluegills somewhere nearby, don&#39;t know exactly where.</p></p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Observed&rdquo; data is a byproduct of National Weather Service (NWS) operations at the 12 CONUS River Forecast Centers (RFCs), and is displayed as a gridded field with a spatial resolution of roughly 4x4 km. &ldquo;Observed&rdquo; data is expressed as a 24-hour total ending at 1200 Z (same as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT), with longer periods simply being a summation of multiple 24-hour periods. 1200 GMT is used as the ending time for a 24-hour total, because it is the end of the &ldquo;hydrologic day&rdquo;, a standard used in river modeling. Additionally, 1200 GMT closely coincides with the reporting time for most of the National Weather Service&rsquo;s cooperative observers, whose data are used as a quality control on the dataset. 1200 GMT coincides with 8 AM EDT, 7 AM EST, 7 AM CDT, 6 AM CST, etc.

<p>Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac. This 1989 Oxford Paperbacks edition, ISBN 0-19-505928-X, as an introductory essay from Robert Finch commemorating the 100th anniversary of Leopold's birth.</p>

<blockquote>We see Leopold, the rural sage, tracking a sunk in January, cutting a venerable dead oak, stalking a legendary fish on Alder Fork or an elusive grouse on an abandoned farm, surveying his private unofficial domain before dawn, wrestling with god-like decisions about tree-thinning, or experiencing a "curious transfusion of courage" from his pines in deep winter.</blockquote>

      <p>I had a disturbing thought while rereading <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm">Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s piece on Nassim Taleb</a> in his latest book which collects his New Yorker essays. What if Taleb is not only profiting from unknownable random adverse events, but also encouraging their proliferation?</p>

<p>The logic runs like this. You place a series of bets, where if you lose you lose $1 and if you win you win $1000000. The bets are on some implausible condition, one which (at the outset) there is no chance of happening. You bet the first time, you lose; the counterparty is $1 richer and one iota more confident. You bet again.</p>

<p>If there really is a one in a million chance of winning, in the long run you will break even. The scary notion, though is the thought that by losing over and over again you can change the probabilities of the game, so that once you have lost 1000 times your opponent - who is $1000 richer - will start making decisions about how they conduct their business that increases the chance that you will win this long-shot bet.</p>

<p>Your series of losses are funding the adversary&#39;s bad behavior. They are up $1000, haven&#39;t lost in 3 years, have an unbroken string of fiscal quarters where each and every quarter they beat the analysts estimates by a penny. Management becomes bolder, knowing that their track record demands that they confidently take on risks that 3 or 6 or 12 years ago whey would have shunned. After a long interrupted run of good fortune misinterpreted as careful skill they seek out the next incrementally more risky and profitable opportunity in order to pursue the growth that you have funded.</p>

<p>I&#39;m challenged to reconcile the strategy of &quot;small wins&quot;, where you look to succeed in small ways over and over again to build confidence, with the Taleb style strategy of &quot;small losses&quot; where you take lots and lots of calibrated long shot bets that often lose. It&#39;s discouraging to think that the confidence that you are building with the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=karl+weick+small+wins&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart">Karl Weick style small win strategy</a> of building upon small incremental gains might be deliberately funded by someone who is set up to profit big time if you grow for a long time and then lose it all.</p>

<p>Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context:</p>

<p>Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Art-of-Living-Mindfully/63292/?sid=at">The Art of Living Mindfully</a> on the work of <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/">Ellen Langer</a>. Her <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/blog/">blog</a> is not frequent but it is thoughtful.</p>

<blockquote>
We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless. We have been taught absolutes when none really exist independent of context. When we think we know something absolutely, we have learned that it is reasonable never to question it, nor to pay attention to how it may be otherwise. Beliefs and behavior always make some kind of sense from the actor’s perspective or else the actor would have done otherwise. Blame suggests mindlessness on the part of the blamer who does not recognize this. We are not at fault for what we do not know just because someone else can see a way we could have known it.

<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1550775">Just Breathe: Meditation as Organizational Slack</a> is a paper by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kaisa-holloway-cripps/3/ba7/b62">Kaisa G. Holloway Cripps</a>. &#0160;Mostly a literature review, it looks at meditation inside an organization and identifies ways where it may be useful to engage human resources that are slack. &#0160;The discussion reminds me of MBA consultants who work like dogs for months and then are periodically &quot;on the beach&quot; for a while when their gig is up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>We measure things that are easy to measure about media, like</p><ul>
<li>time on page, time on site
</li>
<li>click through rate
</li>
<li>conversion rate to some desired action
</li>
<li>frequency of interaction
</li>
<li>responsiveness of interaction
</li>
<li>hot spots that are getting lots of attention
</li>
<li>&quot;lag&quot;, whatever that is, but everyone knows what it is
</li>
</ul>

In general, media that have small amounts of lag are good for gaming, because you can play many small bets and iteratively define a better result. As the amount of lag increases, the attention games change, and you start to get out of the realm of reality-based feedback and into the realm of ROI fictions, and systems that have enormous expensive command and
control infrastructures.&#0160;
<p>It’s one thing to hack people’s attention about tomorrow if you start working on it today, and something very different to plan a campaign that results in their attention (or the fulfillment of their desire) 6 or 12 or 18 or 120 months hence.&#0160;</p><p>Originally written for <a href="http://twitter.com/kevindoylejones">Kevin Doyle Jones</a>, and published obscurely in 2007; rescued and republished with only minor edits 3 years hence.</p>

Clippings are easy to assemble, someone else has done the work, and you can sit down and be done when you&#39;re done.</p><p>What&#39;s harder for me is to write about something that no one else has written down, especially something which you in turn have only limited knowledge of. &#0160;The quotable information from print sources may be locked up in materials that are not scanned in, and perhaps never scanned in unless you scan them in yourself - that is, if you can find anything at all. &#0160;The real stories of how things were might only be tellable if you can locate someone to tell them to you and if you write the stories down carefully for them.</p><p>If you are interested in something and want to publish something about it to mark that interest, you might end up with only a fragment to start. &#0160;There are some media where it&#39;s acceptable to tell a piece of a story that&#39;s an incomplete image, but only a very few. &#0160;&quot;That&#39;s not news&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s your point&quot; are typical reactions when a newspaper behaves that way. &#0160;The encyclopedia&#39;s defense mechanism says &quot;that&#39;s not notable&quot;. &quot;Too long, didn&#39;t read&quot; is the reaction in the blog world. &#0160;So you need some place to dump fragments that don&#39;t have to be complete that&#39;s safe so when it comes time to tell a story you can extend your memory.</p><p>Nothing gets around the problem that the real stories can only be told by people. &#0160;That&#39;s an opportunity and a challenge.</p><p></p>

<p>Smart phones aren&#39;t cheap, but increasingly they don&#39;t seem all that smart either. &#0160;Shiny, yes; futuristic and wonderful, sure. &#0160;But smart, not so much. &#0160;Does your phone remind you of what you need to do, when and where you need to do it, but not so naggingly that you turn it off? &#0160;Probably not. &#0160;Does that smart phone make you look smarter when you&#39;re walking down the street punching buttons on it? &#0160;Not so sure. <a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/status/5560837946">Twittering from the bus to let the planet know which bus has squeaky brakes?</a> &#0160;Uh huh.</p><p>The trap, perhaps, is confusing &quot;smart phone&quot; with &quot;smart person&quot;. &#0160;Does a smart phone make you smart?</p>

<p>One possibility is to ditch phones with contracts entirely and go to a prepaid plan, which means that every call would cost something and I&#39;ve have to be smart about how to use my phone. &#0160;That turns out to be easier now that I have Google Voice, which gives me more tools than ever to not answer my phone but still get a message to me. &#0160;Google Voice lets me direct any call to any phone, and thus the cell phone simply becomes another selectable destination to originate or terminate calls on the same number.</p>

The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://jpd.me/2010/05/21/metblogs-series-finale/">Metblogs series finale</a>:</p><blockquote>[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May.</blockquote>
The metblogs network never intersected with my world, so I don&#39;t know whether this is just the passing of time or some kind of deep-seated, widely felt loss. Their stats:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://detroit.metblogs.com/">Detroit Metblogs</a>: 2,218 posts / 3,722 comments
</blockquote>
which I have to compare with Vacuum, just to give some sense of scale and scope (since 2003 when I started on Typepad):
<blockquote>
2229 Total Posts, 2033 Total Comments
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s all kinds of business models that have to change with time. I can only say that because I lived through the era when modems ruled the Internet, and then after that when they didn&#39;t. So it&#39;s no failing to have started something that was a good idea at the time and then discover that times have changed and your idea doesn&#39;t have a neat transition to the current day.
</p>

<p>Some parts of the Metblogs network died a bit earlier. This <a href="http://morehockeylesswar.org/blog/archive/2008/06/18/the_death_of_portland_metblogs/">2008 post on the situation in Portland</a> signals what happens when founders intent, advertiser interest, and core contributor passions don&#39;t line up:</p>
<blockquote>
There could still be hope for Metblogs. My suggestions of public journalism, open comments and revenue sharing to attract quality writers were met with hostility when I floated them before. Metblogs could be a voice in the Portland digital media milieu. But most likely it will quietly fade further into irrelevance.</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s their <a href="http://www.metblogs.com/news/2010/05/21/well-that-just-happened/">official going out of business notice</a>. &#0160;Here&#39;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/metblogs/">a feature about them from Wordpress</a>, the platform that they had used.</p>

<p>Noted on Twitter by <a href="http://www.thenetworkthinker.com/">Valdis Krebs</a>, who asks</p>
<blockquote>starting to see the end of the &quot;blog phase&quot; of the Web? Or just the assimilation of another &quot;form&quot; into the whole?</blockquote>

<p>If blogs are being assimilated, what are they being assimilated into? &#0160;If they go into newspapers, you get editors and deadlines and a hesitance to be interested in everything in favor of something narrower and more marketable. If the blogger becomes a diarist, then the novelty is writing for the world but not the form itself. Perhaps some bloggers are just frustrated talk radio hosts? &#0160;There are lots of possibilities to be assimilated into another established media form and not to create some new art form.</p>

<p>Another relevant touchpoint is the end of <a href="http://arborupdate.com">Arbor Update</a>, which closed down after a 6 year run. &#0160;In my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/links-arbor-update-blogroll/">requiem for Arbor Update</a>, I note that it gave up the ghost after many of its contributors who were also regular bloggers stopped blogging regularly. &#0160;This suggests a life cycle for blogging that matches what used to happen on Usenet; a cadre would form, start writing together, and then at some point their lives got busy or they got out of grad school or their public writing style needed to be formal and they left en masse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some epidemic model of when blogging stops, which would say something similar to the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370">Framingham obesity study</a> - when your friends stop blogging, you are likely to stop blogging. &#0160;It&#39;s not that any one thing got in the way; it&#39;s just that the cool kids had a million followers on Twitter, and the eyeballs of the media buyers were diverted toward how you could be more like them. &#0160;Or it may be as simple as not seeing eye to eye with a handful of people who are core to your effort and not being able to restart once they leave.</p>

      <p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.</p>
<p>I had to hit &quot;shift-refresh&quot; to force everything to load.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new. &#0160;How few things work that way!</p>
<p>It was especially nice that when I picked a photo to use for the theme, that the system suggested an appropriate accompanying color palette.</p>
<p>Also noted, 5/22/2010: as author, my top navigation bar has an &quot;edit post&quot; button, so I can change things well after the fact. &#0160;This is promising. &#0160;I do notice that there are no archives links anymore and no easy way for anyone to notice that I&#39;ve been plugging away at this for years, but the &quot;search&quot; box is very welcomed, and should unearth some things that would have otherwise been buried.</p>
<p>3/19/11: The design I had picked was &quot;Chroma&quot;. I&#39;ve swapped that out for &quot;Journal Black&quot;, which served to restore the category and archive links. --Ed</p>
<p>4/24/13: Now using the &quot;Clean&quot; theme, with radically simplified sidebars.</p>

      <p>It's a great word; I was looking for some great people who used it.</p>

<p>Google Books is my first search for this stuff, but I wanted to give the query narrowing "search only fiction". &nbsp;Can't do that; ah, perhaps I can; "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?&q=subject%3Afiction+torpor&btnG=Search+Books">subject:fiction torpor</a>" looks pretty good. &nbsp;From The Count of Monte-Cristo:</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</p>

<p>When you're on with a vision of how something could or should be, that great idea of yours is a liability, not an asset. It's going to take some huge amount of effort or activation of an existing set of skills or knowledge to go from bright idea to something that someone else can buy into. Resist the temptation to let other people have your perspective on the world spelled out to them too clearly before it gets a chance to adapt to circumstances, or at the very least if you are going to do this for someone for money sell them something that captures not just the time spent in that room but the whole world that you bring to making that room reflect reality.</p>
