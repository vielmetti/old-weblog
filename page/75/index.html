<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-ann-arbor-start/">Ann Arbor Startup Weekend, June 20-22 2008</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Laura Fisher (and a cast of thousands) is organizing <a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com">Ann Arbor Startup Weekend</a>, June 20-22 2008 in downtown Ann Arbor.<br/></p>

<p><a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com"><br />
<img alt="Laura Fisher photo for Ann Arbor Startup Weekend" title="Large_startup_061208" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/12/large_startup_061208.jpg" border="0"  /><br/></p>

<p>There's a nice <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/06/startup_weekend_to_bring_entre.html">story in the Ann Arbor News</a> about the event; I'll excerpt:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The intent of the event, which has been held in several cities throughout the country, is to start the weekend with no formal business plans and emerge a few days later with a couple of real companies.</p>

<p>Fisher's job is to collect as many business-minded people as possible to bring their ideas and expertise. When the weekend rolls around Friday, June 20, the group will break into teams, choose some of the best ideas and get to work.</p>

<p>"I call it guerilla economic development," she said.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>It can be challenging for traditional economic development practitioners to wrap their heads around support for entrepreneurship.  I dug this up from the Kellogg-funded <a href="http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/chapter2.php">RUPRI Center for Rural Entrepreneurship</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Economic development practitioners are reluctant to abandon the traditional tools of their trade: development of natural resources, industrial attraction and small business retention and expansion. These tools worked in the past and, absent a new toolkit, we tend to continue with the same, familiar strategies.</p>

<p>The outcomes of investing in entrepreneurship occur over the long-term, and individual successes often don’t lend themselves to public ribbon cuttings. Helping an artisan tap new regional markets via the Internet may increase sales and establish a successful business, but it can’t compete with the headlines resulting from a branch plant opening.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>This can explain some of the strained relationships that sometimes happen between entrepreneurs and economic development groups - the measures of success don't happen on the same time or size scales between the two groups.  This doesn't mean that people will be hostile to each other, or that they won't appreciate each others commitments to the process - just that the traditional economic development organization has funding and accountability which simply doesn't let it be a "guerrilla" agency.</p>

<blockquote><br />
From the WSULS News Blog: “Because of a six month extension to an Institute of Library and Museum Services grant, the Wayne State University Library System and the Walter P. Reuther Library just finished adding around 20,000 images and over 400 videos to the Virtual Motor City photo collection, an online resource already containing digitized images from the Detroit News Collection, a photojournalistic resource held at the Reuther Library.</p>

<p>This is the first time that videos were digitized as part of the VMC Project. The new videos added are Detroit News newsreels from the 1920s and include footage from local people and events to more well-known subjects like Babe Ruth and Helen Keller. The videos can be browsed at <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/">http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/</a><br />
</blockquote><br />
<p><br />
There's a remarkable collection of stuff here, though finding things in it is going to be a challenge at first - aside from a small amount of descriptive text per item, the collection is largely unindexed yet.  Some highlights include <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=8_11">the opening of the Detroit Institute of Arts</a>, a 1922 <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=6A_22">parade of old cars</a>, and the <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=3R1_29">1925 Detroit News bread-baking contest</a>.<br />

<a href="http://gasbuddy.com">GasBuddy</a> has built a very nice infrastructure for tracking gas prices across the county.  If you sign up, you can update the site with current observations of pricing; if you don't sign up, you can still view individual and aggregated data.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
The map above is not quite enough to decide where to stop, except to note that if you happen to be heading south you should probably fill up in Ohio, not Michigan (tax differences account for the price difference).  To do the real time decision support to save you a dollar or two on your next tank, use <a href="http://www.gasbuddytogo.com">Gas Buddy To Go</a> on your mobile phone and plug in the city or zip code you're in to get the lowest prices in that area.  <br />

<p><br />
Google's Street View has come to Ann Arbor.  From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon.  The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi's toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.  With the exception of a short foray through the private drive in Barton Hills, nothing outside the freeway limits was explored.  No Ypsi, no Chelsea, not even the bits of Ann Arbor on the wrong side of the concrete walls.<br />

      <p>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form.  Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.</p>

<p>The single best blog on the topic is <a href="http://daveslandslideblog.blogspot.com/">Dave's Landslide Blog</a>, from Dave Petley, who is the Wilson Professor at Durham University, UK.  He's doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won't even try to be up to date with that.</p>

<p>As a previous example:</p>

<p>Lake Sarez in Tajikistan is the result of a 1911 earthquake, forming the 600 meter long Usoi landslide dam.  An <a href="http://eeg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/151">article in GeoScienceWorld by Schuster and Alford</a> discusses the risks of the dam failing.  A <a href="http://www.adrc.or.jp/countryreport/TJK/2003/page4.html">2003 risk mitigation project</a> installed remote warning sensors to alert villagers of risks detected.</p>

<p>Quake Lake in Montana formed after a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1959_08_18.php">1959 earthquake</a>; the <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/magazine/990815_mag01.html">Billings Gazette</a> captured memories of it in 1999.  The US Army Corps of Engineers was quickly put into service to build a spillway for the dam.</p>

<p>There is a limestone pier  <br />
That stretches into blue  <br />
Waves on Lake Superior <br />
   <br />
Where I cast a spoon into  <br />
Water glowing translucent green  <br />
Like sunlight through a leaf <br />
  <br />
And watch a lone fishing boat  <br />
Surrounded by circling gulls  <br />
That cry a plaintive call <br />
  <br />
Make its way from the blue waves  <br />
Toward the calm green water  <br />
Behind the seawall of the harbor  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>In the "try this next year" category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down.  Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there's frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don't have soil.</p>

<p>Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty.</p>

<p>There's apparently television advertising for these things (which tells you how much TV I watch) but these look pretty easy.</p>

<p>without further ado:</p>

<p>from <a href="http://greenthumbs.tribe.net/thread/5ea48cbb-5b2c-4320-8b70-e0e068cc58a9">greenthumbs.tribe.net :</a><br />
<blockquote><br />
My 83 year old dad told me he use to grow upside down tomatoes in an old tin, they would put a small hole in the end of the tin (I guess a paint tin? not sure what type tin they used) and plant the tomato plant upside down and at the top of the tin they would plant a pepper plant. He said they flourished! I have the upside down container that I am going to plant my tomatoes and herbs in this spring...I can't wait!<br />

<blockquote><br />
I had great success with tomato plants, but peppers did poorly. I drilled a single hole and fed my seedlings up through the bottom. This year I am making the hole a little bigger and putting the plant through the inside of the bucket and using some landscape cloth to gold it all in. Last year the buckets with chives, parsley and basil growing on the top side did better. I think because it held the water in better for the tomato roots.<br />

<blockquote><br />
Wow! If I knew there was a market for this, I would have had my grandmother patent it years ago. Since I was a little kid, she always grew her tomatoes upside-down -- by just using a simple plastic bucket & a few strategically placed holes.</p>

<p>And, as an added bonus? She planted azaleas on the top, so it not only looked pretty, but it would keep the bugs & other nasty critters from going after the tomato plant underneath.</p>

<p>We coulda been millionaires.<br />

Thank you for your DIY upside down tomato planter. It is the cheapest, most attractive one I've seen online. I planted two with Bush Celebrity Tomatoes and a third one (the one in the middle) planted with Jalapenos. I planted Thai Basil, Italian Parsley, Purple Sage, Sweet Woodruff, Italian Oregano, and Sweet Basil in the top of the planter. I realized that my pots are hanging a too low, so I have to shorten the cord, but I think they came out pretty good! Can't wait to see if my tomaotes and jalapenos will grow good upside down!<br />

      </h3>
      <p>Frost warnings for Ann Arbor for tonight; that's kind of late.</p>

<p>In the spirit of gardeners everywhere, here's some collected recommendations for dealing with frost damage in your garden.</p>

<p>From Zimbabwe and <a href="http://www.farmradio.org/english/radio-scripts/34-7script_en.asp">Farm Radio International</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Protect Tomatoes from Frost

<p>By Livai Matarirano, Zimbabawe</p>

<p>You can grow tomatoes even in cold weather. A farmer in Zimbabwe, Mr. Francis Handwa, uses cooking oil or milk bottles filled with water to keep tomato plants warm. This is a good alternative to covering tomatoes if used bottles are easy to get. Here is how he does it.</p>

<p>Francis fills cooking oil or milk bottles with water until they are three quarters full. While the plants are still young, he places the bottles upright on the ground among the tomatoes. He places one bottle beside every third plant in every other row. He makes sure that the neck of the bottle appears above the plants. When the plants get taller than the bottles he places stakes beside the tomato plants. He hangs a bottle on each stake with a string. The bottles hang 10 centimetres above the plants.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>from <a href="http://www.gardenersnet.com/vegetable/tomato.htm">GardenersNet:</a></p>

<blockquote>
Tomatoes like it hot! They will die if exposed to frost. Make sure to plant them after the last frost.

<p>Tip#1: Cover your young seedling if frost is predicted. A simple and easy cover  for small seedlings is to buy large or extra large plastic disposable cups. Place them over the seedling at dusk, and remove them in the morning. There is usually little or no wind on nights with frost, so they are not easily tipped over.</p>

<p>Tip#2: If you get a light frost overnight and you did not cover up your plants. Go out early before the sun rises, and spray your plants with the garden hose. This melts the ice off the plants and may save them.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.tomatocasual.com/2007/09/26/how-to-continue-harvesting-your-tomatoes-after-a-frost/">Tomato Casual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
If a more serious frost is coming, cover your plants with something to keep the frost from ending up on the leaves. I like to use sheets but anything like plastic, sheeting, newspaper or other material that can be used like a gentle covering will suffice.

<p>Leave the cover on until the temp breaks that frost level in the mid morning and your plants will be none the worse for wear. Do not, however, leave plastic on the plants in the hot sun as this is damaging to the tomato plant and all your attention will be wasted.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://rebeccasgardenblogs.blogspot.com/2006/09/protecting-tomatoes-from-frost.html">Rebecca's Garden Blogs:</a></p>

<blockquote>
If you still have tomatoes on the vine, keep bed sheets on hand. When frost is in the forecast cover the vines early afternoon before the sun starts setting. This will help trap the daytime heat before the soil cools. Also, try to extend the sheets to cover as much ground as possible. I stretch mine out and put a stone on top to hold it in place. This creates a tee pee which too traps more warmth. Remove covering once the sun comes up. 
</blockquote>

<p>From the Columbia Missourian, <a href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/28/put-plants-bed-blanket-tonight/">Put plants to bed with a blanket tonight<br />
</a><blockquote><br />
According to Sapp, it’s best to cover plants with cloth. A simple flannel bed sheet will do the trick, but make sure that it is lifted slightly off the plants so they have a little breathing room. Cardboard also works, Sapp said. Take a box, place it over low plants and flowers, and then open the box top during the day so the plants can soak up the sun.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Sapp said plastic isn’t the best option for covering plants because it doesn’t sufficiently shield them from frost. Stick with cloth and cardboard to save the seedlings.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>From Rutgers University, <a href="http://ifplantscouldtalk.rutgers.edu/planttalk/article.asp?ID=12">Planting and protecting warm season vegetables</a></p>
<blockquote>
Water walls- There are various clear plastic devices that have long tubes connected in a circle. Once the tubes are filled with water, they will stand up on their own and provide a great deal of frost protection for early tomatoes. The water filled tubes heat up during the day and retain heat during cold nights to protect plants. These thick water walls provide effective insulation to counter cool temperatures. The water walls need to be staked to prevent them from blowing over with strong winds. After frost dates have passed, these devices can be removed.
</blockquote>

<p>Stay warm, and keep your tomatoes protected.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-23-what-is-a2b3-ge/">what is a2b3?  genotypes, unicode characters, and lunch meetings</a>
      </h3>
      <p>every once in a while you have to look at the net to see what other people say that you are.  so here's that search for a2b3.</p>

<p>First, all the things that don't relate to the lunch meeting:</p>

<p>A2B3 is a rare genotype resulting from the inheritance of both A and B genes on one chromosome.</p>

<p>The p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein inhibits a2b3 integrin-mediated cell spreading on vitronectin by blocking PKC-dependent localization of a2b3 to focal contacts</p>

<p>Unicode Character 'YI SYLLABLE CIEX' (U+A2B3)</p>

<p>These two transcripts differ by 75 bp and the protein that is coded by a2b3 has 25 amino acids more.</p>

<p>Second, the lunch meeting series:</p>

<p>Ed Vielmetti's a2b3 group is quite popular (Thursday lunches; I missed it today while I wrote this blog post)</p>

<p>A2B3 is a physical/virtual community. There are many versions of the creation myth, but all involve a band of hardy explorers on a mission to try all the versions of bi bim bap served at restaurants in Ann Arbor. </p>

<p>The Ann Arbor Bi Bim Bop lunch group (a2b3) is a group of people organized by Edward Vielmetti who meet for lunch on Thursdays in Ann Arbor at Eastern Accents.</p>

<p>a2b3 is a reasonably regular lunch series gathering people from the Ann Arbor area to talk (often about tech stuff, but not always and not exclusively) and share a delicious bowl of bi bim bap. There's no agenda, and a very minimal but evolving bits of organization to make sure that everyone who's coming gets at least a little introduction to everyone else.</p>

<p>A2B3 is a motley collection of geeks, tech wizards, corporate startups, educators, students, hobbyists, politicians, activists, and various other identities who gather once a week for lunch and to discuss interesting ideas.</p>

<p>Started by U-M alum and Internet pioneer Ed Vielmetti as a way to see his friends each week, A2B3 has become an informal nexus for local knowledge workers and entrepreneurs.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-22-building-missis/">Building Mississippi cottages, tearing down New Orleans houses</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0522/p01s05-usgn.html">The Christian Science Monitor has a good story with pictures of the current state of the "Mississippi Cottage" design of manufactured housing.</a></p>

<p><blockquote>Hurricane Katrina downsized his domain to nothing. Today, his new castle is about one-seventh the size of his old one, measuring 450 square feet. But surveying the familiar view from the dollhouse porch of his &ldquo;Mississippi cottage,&rdquo; Mr. Voorhies is one of many storm survivors who have reassessed their coastal existence.</p>

<p>"Small works for me right now," Voorhies says of his cottage, one of nearly 2,400 the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) has given to state residents to replace the FEMA trailer. "There's less to lose."</p>

<p>Not everyone is an enthusiast of the Mississippi cottage – a wheeled version of the now famous Katrina Cottage – despite its compact cuteness. Most communities along the now-rebuilding Gulf Coast have demanded that MEMA haul them out by next March, citing concerns about their storm-worthiness, low assessed values, and aesthetics. That is leading some cottage-dwellers to vow to fight for their abodes, promising a showdown ahead.</blockquote></p>

<p>New Orleans is grappling with post-hurricane demolitions, including teardowns of houses the owners have been planning to renovate. See the <a href="http://www.squanderedheritage.com/">Squandered Heritage</a> blog for details, and note that a team from New Orleans will be at the <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/wholesale-demolition-new-orleans-neighborhoods">NetSquared conference coming in May 27-28 2008</a>.  Here's some small measure of the problem they are up against:</p>

<p><blockquote>
My house was a 1945 Gentilly bungalow with double parlor, original floors, the Gentilly tile, and deco molding. It was in no danger of falling down. My contractor drove by, called, and asked why there were bulldozers on the property the morning they tore it down. Before he could reach us, the house was gone.</p>

<p>I cannot return to the city now. I feel such pure fury when I think of my house being torn down. City bulldozers trespassed on my property and tore down my lovely Gentilly bungalow. New Orleans has nothing to do with America anymore. New Orleans is dead to me, and I will not lift a finger to help or give back to it again.<br />

      <h3>ALL WATCHED OVER BY MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE</h3>

<pre>
I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.</pre>

<pre>
I like to think
      (right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully 
past computers
as if they were flowers 
with spinning blossoms.
</pre>

<pre>
I like to think
      (it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology 
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

bill tozier, nobody can explain what I do</p>

<p>quorum.</p>

<p>tozier: talking, thinking for way too long; read in newspaper.  want to know what we mean.</p>

<p>independent workers, sharing space, resources; share: utilities, all the way to child care, insurance.  </p>

<p>what do people get from coworking?  sharing risks, offer opportunities for collaboration, lowering fixed costs, getting perks not from home.   most people can do this from home.  talking about it as if it was brand new.  started with a2b3 networking lunch.  microcoworking, get together at cafe at regular schedule.  that works, 4-5 up to a dozen, projects, give each other work.  success, too much of a success, can't get this many people in a room to work together.  natural size has hit its size.  </p>

<p>question: what do we do in addition?</p>

<p>suppose there was a shared permanent space in ann arbor, for ann arbor, coffee, drinks, teaching, training, lab work, shop work, art, some subset more than sitting at little tables with laptops.  think there's room for more stuff, not sure what that stuff is, what would you like?  all a different answer (good thing).  think there's enough overlap, don't know how.  </p>

<p>1.  what would IT be to begin with?<br />
2.  what entity would write the checks?  someone takes risk.<br />
3.  what would we do to join?<br />
4.  what do we do next?  </p>

<p>last: write it down when we all have access to it.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>1. donuts?  no donuts.  not our space, don't own it, can't do it there.<br />
2.  need: whiteboard, other people breathing around me<br />
3.  models: people from here, visitors.  "we" is flexible.  compare to hotel.<br />
4.  range of people laptop, +whiteboard, +coding, +hardware all the way to tech shop</p>

<p>we understand "co", now what do we mean "working"</p>

<p>5.  access to tools, especially special tools<br />
6.  how important is seeing other people?<br />
7.  utility of access to people, and not just tools - training<br />
8.  washtenaw community college fabrication class, fridays (students)<br />
9.  need for privacy?  private locker?<br />
10.  pottery guild on hoover, cooperative.  board runs it, dues are paid, students money.<br />
11.  ymca, locker, just "go", don't have to bring everything with you every time.<br />
12.  location: office shared easy, warehouse harder.<br />
13.  ICON office space, $250/mo, printers etc - no longer there<br />
14.  conference phone?  little conference room?  hands free room.<br />
15.  30 people - swan theater below first street, $1500/mo - 25, $60/mo each.<br />
16.  create an organization that's a cooperative?  copy something that's comfortable</p>

<p>do we need to have everything that it's going to be like?</p>

<p>17.  model of membership: join core group, add additional memberships<br />
18.  overlap between "makers" and "laptopper" people<br />
19.  how to get informal networking, cooperation going?  <br />
20.  little production room / sound room<br />
21.  not jump in with huge bureaucracy and accounting process, really simple</p>

<p>(lots of discussion)</p>

<p>22.  model is potter's guild?</p>

<p>what other organizations are models?  </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-threequel-three/">threequel === threequal - of movies, code, and the l33t</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few definitions for you, with citations from the wild; spelling is as in the original with Google counts of occurences, if possible.</p>

<p>In short: threequel and 3quel are about movies; threequal is the "===" operator; 3qual is hacker speak.  More or less.</p>

<h3>threequel (33,900):</h3>

<p>When I was a kid, I assumed all third installments in a horror series had to capitalize on the ability to turn the “3″ in the title into “3-D.” Now, looking back, I only really remember (and can only find proof of) Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th 3-D and Amityville 3-D. But that isn’t stopping me from assuming Hollywood will once again abuse the gimmick.  </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.spout.com/2008/02/27/hollywood-steps-up-to-the-3d-threequel/"><br />
"Hollywood steps up to the 3-D Threequel", SpoutBlog </a> 2008</p>

<p>Spider-Man 3. Shrek 3. Pirates of the Caribbean 3. When did third-installment movies make a comeback? There's already a special multiplex in Hell that shows only Lethal Weapon 3, Beverly Hills Cop 3, and Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College. Below, we evaluate the lasting contributions of other classically bad "threequels."  </p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/05/attack_of_the_threequel.html">"Attack of the Threequel", New York Magazine</a>, 2007</p>

<h3>threequal (1,540):</h3>

<p>The operator === is unique to Ruby (as far as I am aware). The common name for it is the case equality operator because it is used implicitly by case statements. But this is slightly misleading, as I said earlier, because it is not really "equality" at all. In this book, I often use the term relationship operator. I did not invent this term, but I can't find its origin, and it is not in common use today. The "hip and trendy" name for this is the threequal operator ("three equals").  </p>

<p><a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/0768667208/ch01lev1sec6">_The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming_, Second Edition. </a></p>

<p>Every class typically has a "threequal" operator === defined. The expression class === instance will be true if the instance belongs to the class. The relationship operator is usually known as the case equality operator because it is used implicitly in a case statement. This is therefore a way to act on the class of an expression.  </p>

<p>_The Ruby Way_</p>

<p>So (1..5) === 3 is true because 3 is in that range, but 3 isn't equal to that range, so 3 === (1..5) doesn't return true. Logical enough. If you're wondering how you're supposed to remember all this, you aren't. You don't really even need to know it. The === method exists for controlling how a case/when block will evaluate an object. It should never be used by humans. It is code written to be consumed by other code, specifically, by case and when.</p>

<h3>3quel (1,200):</h3>

<p>In its pre-TV glory days, Hollywood made a few series--Andy Hardy, The Thin Man, the Bob Hope-- Bing Crosby Road comedies, and horror films with the whole Frankenstein family. But these were middling fare. The big-ticket items were singular sensations. Nobody made a sequel to Gone With the Wind, Casablanca or Ben-Hur. The industry didn't think in roman numerals until The Godfather, Part II in 1974. But with the triumph of special-effects fantasies like Star Wars, sequels became a smart way to print money. Now they are needed to turn bad years into good ones. The difference between the box-office slump of 2005 and the rebound last year can be attributed to one film: Pirates 2. That's why the trifecta of threequels is crucial to Hollywood's health.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1574141,00.html">Time Magazine, "The Year of the 3quel" Jan 4, 2007</a></p>

<h3>=== (7,220,000 in Google Code Search; unsearchable in Google)</h3>

<p>Suppose though that we don't want to allow a string containing a three to match with a number three. Let's add another equals.</p>

<p>if (x === y + z) {alert('true');}</p>

<p>This still does a comparison between x and the result of adding y and z but now no conversion of numbers into strings (in fact no type conversions at all) is permitted when doing the actual comparison. Now the values being compared must be of the same data type as well as have the same value. A string containing a three is not of the same type as a number containing a three and so the comparison evaluates as false.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-reification-is/">Reification is an ontological imperative</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Reification is an ontological imperative.</p>

<p>I think that this might be some deep statement about the
semantic web, but it's so deep that I really don't understand it.</p>

<p>Reification in this sense appears to have something to do with
taking abstract concepts and making them concrete, turning 
ad hoc heuristics into code, writing down a set of things into
a list so that it can be machine processed and sorted, and 
otherwise taking thoughts and ideas and turning them into bits.</p>

<p>Ontological has to do with categories and classification, the
relationships between things, and especially how to create data
structures to represent these.  In typical ontologies, the result
is some data structure that looks like a graph, often but not
necessarily a hierarchy, which puts things into buckets based
on their essential features.</p>

<p>If I had to reprocess this through my own experience, it would
have to do with the relationship between writing things down
and sorting through them.  Fundamentally, if you are going to
take a long list of abstractions and make them concrete, you
get as a necessary side effect the ability to distinguish between
them and group them into bunches based on attributes that may
not have been explicit in the abstract conceptions of things.</p>

<p>To see someone else having thought through the repercussions of
this, see:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">
Clay Shirky, "Ontology is overrated"</a>.  On tagging systems
vs. hierarchical classification, and how it's OK to have tag
collections from a bunch of people make sense of the identity
of things on the net vs. having centralized catalogers do that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2006/07/tags-reading-and-listening-list.php">
Tim Spalding on Tags: A reading and listening list</a>, from Thing-ology.
Tim has addressed the problem of making explicit people's
information about their own books in a way that makes
collective information visible with LibraryThing, and there's
a lot more to it than just saying "tags rock!".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2008/04/14/detroit-presentation-the-politics-of-metrics/">Ed Yourdon, "The Politics of Metrics"</a>, a talk he gave at the Software Best Practices conference in Detroit in April 2008.
When the thing to be reified is the behavior of individuals, and
the ontology that is applied is a measure of quality or success,
there are all manner of messy politics and second-order effects
that come into play.</p>

<p><a href="http://joechip.net/brian/2007/12/06/alive-to-the-extent/">Brian Kerr channeling Christopher Alexander</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
“To seek the timeless way we first must know the quality without a number. There is a central quality which is the rooted criterion of life and the spirit of man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be numbered.”
</blockquote>

<p>I write this down (reification), and then Typepad insists that I add a category to it (ontological imperative).  It landed in "cyberinfrastructure", this weird bag of side effects of computerizing the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Through some random chance encounter on the net - that is to say,<br />
I don't remember why I found it - I'm offline right now.</p>

<p>The tool of choice for going offline is a little Mac application<br />
called <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/">Freedom</a>, which disables your Internet access for a specified<br />
period of time so that you can get things done.  Written by Fred <br />
Stutzman at UNC.</p>

<blockquote>
Freedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only circumvention of the Freedom time limit you specify. The hassle of rebooting means you're less likely to cheat, and you'll be more productive. Not rebooting is why we bought Apple computers in the first place. When first getting used to Freedom, I suggest using the software for short periods of time.
</blockquote>

<p>It's a great idea, especially for the times when you find yourself<br />
overwhelmed by the 1000000000s of possible things to do when you<br />
are on line, and when reducing the number of options is key to actually<br />
accomplishing any one task.</p>

<p>(Obviously I'm back online to post this!)</p>
