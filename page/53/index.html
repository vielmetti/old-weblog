        <p>James Poulos in a comment on Ricochet on the role of editors: Writers now have competing pressures -- to be witty, quick, ironic, noticeable, flip, to dispatch every clay pigeon tossed up by a culture pandemic with pigeons; but also to self-edit, to self-moderate, to be reticent at the right time, to pussyfoot expertly, to pick battles, to avoid perils, to besmirch rarely, to duck blame, to satisfy spectral overseers. This is a serious pickle, is it not? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-12-spectral-overseers-as-guides-to-good-online-behavior/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>An essay published in Open Letters Monthly. What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings.

        <p>for reference: The A2B3 logo design is by Laura Fisher of Mitten Artworks. The font is P22&#39;s London Underground. &#0160;Accept no substitutes. The stickers I printed were printed at VG Kids&#0160;in Ypsilanti. &#0160;We used a&#0160;2.75&quot; x 4.25&quot; oval, and one of their standard templates. The hoodie with the top secret illuminati lining is still under construction. Update 6/13/10: Typekit has the P22 London Underground font, for $25/yr. &#0160;Hmm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-06-05-a2b3-logo/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>More at VacuumLand&nbsp;and a review at the Austin Statesman. The convention isn't open to the public, but if you were to drop in, you'd find these people attending clinics on repairing, cleaning and restoring vacuums. You'd see them holding vacuuming contests, playing "Vacuum Jeopardy" and eating vacuum-shaped cake on tables decorated with vacuum components. Each was allowed to bring along 12 vacuums. Next time I'll ask for a press pass. Thanks to Ann Hanson for the heads up. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-06-05-vacuum-cleaner-collectors-club-25th-annual-convention/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I had a disturbing thought while rereading Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s piece on Nassim Taleb in his latest book which collects his New Yorker essays. What if Taleb is not only profiting from unknownable random adverse events, but also encouraging their proliferation? The logic runs like this. You place a series of bets, where if you lose you lose $1 and if you win you win $1000000. The bets are on some implausible condition, one which (at the outset) there is no chance of happening. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-06-01-breeding-black-swans/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I wanted to write something short and pithy and insightful for Facebook or Twitter or some other minimalist thing and couldn&#39;t come up with anything. &#0160;The ultrashort format is not suited to ruminations on things you don&#39;t completely understand and are trying to work out in the process of writing about them. Instead I will go for a walk. Perhaps this is a rumination on the length of communications, their immediacy and the expected audience. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-30-the-margin-is-too-small-to-contain-this/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I used this phrase in my meaningless indicators of progress post. Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context: Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called The Art of Living Mindfully on the work of Ellen Langer. Her blog is not frequent but it is thoughtful. We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless. We have been taught absolutes when none really exist independent of context. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-27-mindless-mindfulness/">&raquo;</a></p>
