ANN ARBOR, July 1, 2014: The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission is considering the Glendale Condominiums, a proposed development at 312 Glendale Place. Neighbors came out in force to oppose the development, citing among other things the impact that the proposed new impervious surface would exacerbate the existing flooding events that have affected the nearby neighborhoods. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-07-01-the-internet-of-sump-pumps-and-citizen-opposition-to-glendale-place-condos-ann-arbor-planning/">&raquo;</a></p>

By "things" I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can't connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-27-the-internet-of-things/">&raquo;</a></p>

Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn't produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you've visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there's something new.
It's a wonderful way to consume content, and since you're always looking at new things it's a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-05-08-creating-vs-consuming/">&raquo;</a></p>

Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray.

        <p>A map from the James River Association in Virginia shows the problem: the water intake for the city of Richmond, Virginia is on the James River, downstream from a crude oil spill in Lynchburg, Virginia.

From the Richmond Times-Dispatch -
 No one was killed or injured when more than a dozen CSX tanker cars derailed on Wednesday afternoon, but the resulting fire and spill prompted City Manager Kimball Payne to declare an emergency and temporarily evacuate part of downtown. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-30-fiery-james-river-oil-spill-threatens-richmond-virginia-water-supply/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the "Paid for by" language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.
I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-20-paid-for-by-for-mayor-of-ann-arbor-an-analysis-of-campaign-advertising-disclosure/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've unsubscribed from a local politics mailing list that I've been on for a while. Out of an abundance of not wanting to name names, I'm not naming names; chances are there's one of these in your community too.
The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There's a list owner, who sets the rules. One of the rules is that the list is a private list, with no reporters on it and no one is supposed to share anything they get from the list to anyone who's not on the list. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-14-unsubscribing-from-a-bitter-local-politics-list-before-i-get-kicked-off/">&raquo;</a></p>
