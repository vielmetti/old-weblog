      <p>New for the winter storm season is names for storms. The Weather Channel and the Weather Underground are both using the names, even though the National Weather Service is not planning to pick up on them.</p>
<p>Sample coverage from the Weather Underground for <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/winter-storm/athena-2012" target="_self">Athena</a>&#0160;- they&#39;re consolidating commentary about the storm plus a radar track and reports of peak wind and snowfall.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/post/2012/2012-11-07-typepad-editor-blockquote-bug/">Typepad editor blockquote bug</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Writing this up to support a bug report, please excuse the technical intrusion.</p>
<p>When I use the blockquote function in the Typepad editor, there&#39;s a sequence of steps that causes me to lose text out of the editor.</p>
<p>A series of screen captures follows. The general pattern runs like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>create three paragraphs</li>
<li>select the second paragraph, and blockquote it; the third paragraph blockquotes as well</li>
<li>switch to HTML view to confirm that the blockquote includes two paragraphs</li>
<li>switch back to rich text</li>
<li>reselect the second paragraph, and unblockquote it; nothing seems to happen</li>
<li>switch to HTML view; the second and third paragraphs are not there</li>
<li>reswitch to rich text, the second and third paragraphs disappear</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m using Chrome 21 on MacOS 10.5.8; the same problem happens on Safari on the same machine.</p>

<p>Create three paragraphs

      </h3>
      <p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" /></a>I think I voted today.</p>
<p>I used the <strong>Automark</strong> machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&#39;ve used this machine before <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error.html" target="_self">many times</a>, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator.</p>
<p>The actual practice of voting went fine. It&#39;s a long ballot, and I went through all of the eleections, in some cases undervoting the ballot (see &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/10/bullet-voting-or-plunking-as-a-voting-strategy-in-pick-n-elections.html" target="_self">plunking</a>&quot;) and in other cases not voting at all when I didn&#39;t know anything about any of the candidates (my bad).&#0160;</p>
<p>The touch screen on the Automark device that I used didn&#39;t have perfect registration, and so every so often I&#39;d hit a button for one candidate adn it would mark the other one. You&#39;d think that you could design a screen so that the ballot &quot;hot spot&quot; for each candidate was further apart, don&#39;t you think? But I was careful and made sure to vote for the right candidate each time.</p>
<p>The first problem occurred as the ballot was being printed. The printer went kachunka-chunka and printed both sides of the ballot, but then it stopped with an error message to call an election official. The very nice election officials didn&#39;t know any more about the error message than I did, so we decided to pull the machine apart to extract the printed ballot, and if it turned out to be wrong to spoil it and start over. It came out OK, I double checked it and it was printed on both sides, so it looked right.</p>
<p>Next, time to insert it into the tabulator. Usually you insert the ballot into the tabulator from the top, right? But the tabulator wouldn&#39;t take the ballot. I then put it in backwards, and the machine accepted it. I just hope that it read it correctly.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a confidence-inspiring visit to the polling place.</p>

<p>If your screen is small enough (like mine) that the results are clipped, you can go to the <A href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/625.html">California election results map</a> page and see the whole thing. And, if you&rsquo;re interested in the code and the data behind this, you can find <A href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/data/election_data.json">2012 California election data in Javascript</a>, <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/data/election_jsonp.js">California 2012 election data in JSONP</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/wnyc/election_california_2012">the source code for the 2012 California election map</a> on Github.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Long Island Power Authority has not one but three maps showing power outages and restorations. I&#39;m not sure which is most informative. Each of these are from the evening of Saturday, November 3, 2012. Please click through to the page linked for current updates.</p>
<p>Some news that goes along with this:</p>
<p>Newsday, Tuesday November 6: &quot;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cuomo-blasts-delays-in-power-restoration-as-unacceptable-1.4191546" target="_self">Cuomo blasts delays in power restoration as &#39;unacceptable&#39;</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criticism of LIPA&#39;s outage map prompted the utility to produce a new format.</p>
<p>It came under intense heat and skepticism Monday after ratepayers noticed outages in their area were reported to be considerably smaller than they knew to be the case.</p>
<p>Hervey said LIPA sharply cut back the touted capability of the map to remove most interactivity, including restoration times in specific neighborhoods, and other details of outages, because the features weren&#39;t working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newsday, Monday Novmeber 5: &quot;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/new-storm-lipa-outages-gas-lines-frustrate-liers-1.4190867" target="_self">New storm, LIPA outages, gas lines frustrate LIers</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As he did last week, Cuomo expressed anger at utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The progress is unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that the utility companies have not performed adequately. The utilities are paid to provide service. They should have been prepared.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LIPA chief operating officer <strong>Michael Hervey</strong> on Sunday acknowledged a large backlog in uploading current information to the outage system. Crews are focused on work, he said, but LIPA is working harder to get the information current and accurate.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not enough for Pat Davis, who was forced to evacuate her&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;home because the family could not remain there with their 1-year-old as temperatures dropped below 50 degrees. She said the outage map shows only 1,000 outages in the neighborhood, but &quot;I do not know anybody south of&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;Road with power, as well as many north of Merrick Road without power.&quot;</p>

<p>A sign on the door of the large&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//National_Grid">National Grid</a>/LIPA complex on Mill Road read: &quot;This office is temporarily closed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/powerless-lipa-customers-frustrated-suspicious-of-numbers-1.4188048" target="_self">Newsday, Monday November 5:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LIPA was reporting that 263,000 customers remained without power as of Monday morning, down from the high of 945,000 a week ago. The number excludes around 30,000 customers in the Rockaway Peninsula,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Beach,_NY">Long Beach</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Atlantic_Beach,_NY">Atlantic Beach</a>, and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Fire_Island,_NY">Fire Island</a>&#0160;whose homes were so badly damaged they cannot take electric service.</p>
<p>The outage map, a critical link to many customers seeking information on their anticipated restoration time, has taken a skewering since the storm began. First it reported thousands more outages than some hamlets or villages had actual LIPA customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On day five of the largest outage in&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Island,_NY">Long Island</a>&#0160;history, LIPA received unprecedented levels of reinforcements -- 900 line workers from&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Canada">Canada</a>, Florida and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Arizona">Arizona</a>, some airlifted here with their equipment, according to Hervey. The flights were arranged by Gov. Andrew M.&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Andrew_Cuomo">Cuomo</a>&#0160;working with federal officials. The total workforce is now well over 3,100 workers.</p>
<p>LIPA spokesman Mark Gross said the number of workers in the field would be 4,300 by this morning, with another 1,000 being added by day&#39;s end, which would be more workers than any prior LIPA restoration effort.</p>

<p>This dramatic map shows areas where power is out (in red), where it has been restored (in blue), and where there was never a service interruption (in grey).

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Sandy hit the US East Coast earlier this week, knocking out power to more than 8 million subscribers. The damage to the infrastructure was so severe that it&#39;s expected to take more than a week to bring service back.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.</p>
<p><strong>NY Times</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/30/nyregion/new-york-power-outages.html" target="_self">tracking power outages and restoration for the Con Edison service</a>. They&#39;re pulling county by county data from the utility company web site and tracking and visualizing it over time. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/31/nyregion/where-the-power-is-out-and-returning.html" target="_self">More detailed reporting also covers surrounding states</a>, including hard-hit New Jersey and Long Island.

<p>Another tracker for Con Edison outage information has been done by Cameron Cundiff (@<a href="http://twitter.com/ckundo" target="_self">ckundo</a>) from Pivotal Labs. This one features <a href="https://github.com/ckundo/coned_charts" target="_self">source code on Github</a>&#0160;and a chart on <a href="http://stormpox.com/" target="_self">stormpox.com</a>.&#0160;</p>

<p>The &quot;Storm Center&quot; application from iFactor powers the web sites for a number of the larger utilities affected by Hurricane Sandy. In&#0160;<a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com/storm-center-put-to-the-test-during-sandy/">Storm Center put to the test during Sandy</a>, they discuss how the systems held up in the storm. Some&#0160;3,500,000 visits were logged to the mapping pages, and of those 20-50% were from mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>NYC Power Status</strong></p>
<p>Does NYC have power? A simple page shows current restoration status by borough. &quot;Con Edison is working on it.&quot; See <a href="http://www.nycpowerstatus.com" target="_self">nycpowerstatus.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The trouble with utility outage tracking</strong></p>
<p>The hardest part about tracking utility outages across a broad area is that there&#39;s wide variety in how each utility reports outages. It would be useful to a lot of organizations to have a single map covering the whole storm area, but instead we have little pieces of a big picture.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m at Lou Rosenfeld&#39;s talk at the Michigan Union, with the title &quot;Beyond user research: Building an organizational brain&quot;. Notes below.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;You are not your user.&quot; The importance of talking to your users. The book &quot;Design of Everyday Things&quot;, 1986 as a watershed event. Everyone understands this now, so &quot;we won&quot;. But what does victory look like?</p>
<p>&#0160;Less of an information architect, more of an information therapist.</p>
<p>Reports from the user research group; information about site search analytics (in another group); logs from the call center (yet another group); reports from web analytics applications (yet another group); also &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; (survey research); CRM applications like Salesforce; papers from a research center; papers from the net; a &quot;mental model&quot; diagram; brand architecture research; net promoter score (survey research).</p>
<p>The problem: where&#39;s the insight in a situation that&#39;s completely siloed. Risk to &quot;user research&quot; work is that it&#39;s siloed away. If you collaborate you&#39;re &quot;the brain for the organization&quot;.</p>
<p>1. What vs. why.&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Quantitative vs qualitiative.</p>
<p>3. Organizational goals vs user goals.</p>
<p>4. Measure what you know vs. explore what you don&#39;t know. (Look for outliers, surprises, patterns.)</p>
<p>5. Statistical data vs. descriptive data.</p>
<p>How to succeed in getting user research to cooperate? Use data from other siloes. Examples: site search data from search logs; match persona with search log analysis; use analytics tools to frame questions about user behavior; field study + analytics combined.&#0160;</p>
<p>Example: query search for &quot;lost&quot; on Netflix.</p>
<p>How to get out of your silo: get out of your (physical) space; eat in the other cafeteria.</p>
<p>Boundary object: things that are common to a couple of fields. Linkages are connective areas of shared interest.</p>
<p>(The preso will be up in slideshare....these notes are incomplete of course)</p>
<p>Build a map - put the various interests on the map to generate the space that you can evaluate the various options.&#0160;</p>
<p>Stop using words - &quot;useless, misunderstood terms impede progress&quot;. Meaningless buzzwords, none of which involve solving problems.</p>
<p>Build a dashboard (a failed metaphor) which incorporates information across a number of separate siloes.&#0160;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] These models are predicting that Sandy will get caught up by the trough approaching the Eastern U.S., which will inject a large amount of energy into the storm, converting it to a powerful subtropical storm with a central pressure below 960 mb and sustained winds of 60 - 70 mph. Winds of this strength would likely cause massive power outages, as trees still in leaf take out power lines. Also of great concern are Sandy&#39;s rains. Given that ocean temperatures along the Northeast U.S. coast are about&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at">5°F above average</a>, there will be an unusually large amount of water vapor available to make heavy rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy is now a category 1 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and central pressure of 970 hPa (see picture).&#0160; My community is all aflutter about this storm, particularly since our forecast models are&#0160;<strong>not&#0160;</strong>in agreement&ndash;some suggest the storm will intensify and head straight in to the Middle Atlantic coastline, some take it out to sea, and others move it out to sea before swinging it westward to hit New England or the Canadian maritimes.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?</p>
<p>I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;<a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-October/date.html" target="_self">outages</a>&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. One report of call failures listed the following cities:</p>
<pre>Cedar Rapids
Springfield, IL
Madison, WI
Green Bay, WI
Minneapolis
Sioux Falls
Omaha
Des Moines
Dubuque
Fargo
St. Louis
Davenport
Kansas City
Detroit
</pre>
<p>as affected.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.</p>
<p>2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</p>
<p>3. Cast 4 votes, leaving none behind, and choosing one of the candidates you are opposed to to round out the ballot.</p>
<p>The strategy is called &quot;bullet voting&quot;, and it has some pros and cons which are neatly spelled out in this <a href="http://larrydavidson.blogspot.com/2005/09/bullet-voting-pro-and-con.html" target="_self">2005 blog post from Larry Davidson</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, to bullet-vote or not? The choice depends entirely on which scenario you think is more probable. If the race for fourth place is between your two favorite candidates, you should bullet-vote. If the race for fourth place is between your second choice and someone you strongly dislike, you should not bullet-vote. Maybe it’s not how they would handle it on&#0160;<em>Numb3rs,&#0160;</em>but math can’t give you a definite answer here.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullet voting is also known as &quot;plunking&quot;. The general case of voting systems being gamed by strategic voters is more common than you&#39;d expect, since it can give a coordinated minority the ability to decide an election over a disorganized majority.</p>

He&#39;s got a 1942 Jack Renie Street Guide of Los Angeles,&quot; [Glen] Creason said. &quot;He has four of the first Thomas Bros. guides from 1946. Those are very hard to find. The one copy we have is falling apart because it&#39;s been so heavily used. We had to photocopy it.&quot;</p>
<p>Creason was also enthralled by the discovery of several &quot;Mapfox&quot; Los Angeles street guides published in 1944. Creason said in his 32-year library career he had never seen one.</p>

      <p>I had my first chance to sit at the new Elixir Vitae cafe on East Liberty today. The store is one of two with that name, after the Cafe Ambrosia store on Maynard Street changed its name. (Same ownership, just a new name, because of conflicts with too many other coffee businesses called Ambrosia).</p>
<p>Some impressions:</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more sunshine in the new cafe than there ever was in the old one. Maynard is shaded by the parking structure and by Tower Plaza, but East Liberty has a nice south-facing window and light coming in.</p>
<p>The general ambiance is about the same, but not as many people have discovered the new cafe just yet. I&#39;m expecting it to eventually get something between a Main Street and a State Street sense to it, but for now, I was mostly alone in using the place for an extended typing session.</p>
<p>The local events bulletin board has a good selection to look at - it&#39;s not quite as big as the Maynard location, which has in my opinion one of the finest bulletin boards in town.</p>
<p>All in all a solid showing and a good new place to go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor City Council holds meetings twice each month, which are <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/communicationsoffice/ctn/meetingplace/Pages/TheMeetingPlace.aspx" target="_self">streamed online through the city&#39;s CTN network</a>. I tuned in last night on my laptop to listen and watch.</p>
<p>While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=typd" target="_self">a2council</a>&#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience. The running cmmentary made it easier to follow what was going on, and it served as a back channel to help make sense of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The council was working from an agenda that&#39;s in the <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com" target="_self">Legistar system</a>, and from time to time I&#39;d go back to that to see what the text of an agenda item was, to look at supporting materials, and see the detail.</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Chronicle does near-real-time news coverage as a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/category/civic-news-ticker/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker</a>, reporting out results from key votes and decisions during the meeting. This is brief coverage but important, and it sets the stage for their 10,000 word meeting reports that come out a week or so later.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a window open to <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a>, which has a local encyclopedia of information about what is going on in the city and the surrounding area. As council considered various options, I looked up what Arborwiki had to say about the current state of affairs, and updated it as best I could to reflect the meeting results and the news that was happening.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that watching this multi-connected stream was different from the experience of being in the same room as council. You miss the non-verbal communications, the body language, the hallway conversations that take place during breaks, and all sorts of in-person nuance. But for what it was, I&#39;m pretty happy with the experience. It felt like I was engaged with the meeting and could have a sense that I was part of the civic process.</p>

      <p>What we got:</p>

<p>Yellow beans - &quot;one more week of these&quot;</p>
<p>1/2 peck Rome apples. &quot;We lost 80% of the crop, only have 5 varieties instead of 20&quot;</p>
<p>Flat leaf parsley</p>
<p>Radishes</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes</p>
<p>Sweet red peppers</p>
<p>The market was busy and there was a full set of vendors under the covered awnings, but no one in the sand lot.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> is a local encyclopedia about the Ann Arbor area that anyone can edit. Up til now, it&#39;s been running on the same Mediawiki software that powers Wikipedia, but we&#39;re in the process of moving it to a new Localwiki instance.</p>
<p><a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a> is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California. The Localwiki software is especially good at handling maps, and so it should be that much easier to map out the streets and roads of Ann Arbor and surrounding Washtenaw County.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now also a new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/" target="_self">Facebook group</a> to discuss Arborwiki, which has been handy for sorting through restart visuals. I&#39;ll make sure to invite everyone who has touched the project so far to it.</p>
<p>In response to some questions:</p>
<p>The migration process has been relatively smooth so far, with about 10,000 pages moved in without much in the way of hand-editing things to patch them up. There&#39;s an importer for Mediawiki pages into Localwiki that handles a lot of the heavy lifting. We had to redesign the home page to take advantage of the new include file syntax, and there are some Mediawiki templates that I used for automatically generating links to news clippings that I&#39;ll have to reimagine. Localwiki founder Philip Neustrom has been a big help, and we&#39;re running on a Ubuntu instance that Ryan Eby at the Ann Arbor District Library spun up for us.</p>
<p>Not a lot of the Arborwiki pages had maps on them, so Philip wrote a little bit of custom code to make that happen more frequently by automatically recognizing some pages with addresses on them.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>
<p>In Lincoln, Nebraska, the library system is looking at spending $43 million on a new main downtown library. &quot;The study envisions a “21st century main library” with a café, 250-seat auditorium with green rooms, a black box theater, kitchen, Internet stations and larger adult, children and teen areas. There is no projected increase to the staff of 60.&quot; [<a href="http://watchdog.org/50875/pershing-center-could-become-a-new-library-for-43-million/" target="_self">Nebraska Watchdog</a>] The current library is more than 50 years old and needs &quot;costly updates&quot;.

<p>In Ann Arbor, Michigan, the library system has a ballot proposal that would fund a $65 million project to build a new downtown library. The library system FAQ envisions a &quot;21st century library building&quot; with a cafe, 400-seat auditorium, a grand reading room, expanded Internet production stations and a destination youth programming area.

<p><strong>Teachers</strong></p>
<p>Chicago teachers start their seventh day of a teachers strike Tuesday, as the city goes to court to try to end the strike on the grounds that it is illegal.

<p><strong>Sidewalks</strong></p>
<p>In 1888, an Ann Arbor City Council meeting was dominated by petitions from citizens for the city to put in sidewalks. In one case, a resident asked that a neighbor&#39;s dilapidated barn be torn down to make way for a sidewalk. [<a href="http://oldnews.aadl.org/node/93778" target="_self">Ann Arbor Argus</a> / Old News]</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Ann Arbor City Council meeting had an extended discussion of filling in the gaps in the city&#39;s sidewalk network. Council members noted several locations in their wards where students did not have a safe way to walk to school on sidewalks or a safe place to cross busy streets; others on council noted that the existing non-motorized transportation plan already addressed this and other issues. When it came to a vote, the proposal to study sidewalk gaps was turned down 6-5.

      </h3>
      <p>As I listen to a plane go overhead today, I remember how quiet it was here in Ann Arbor after 9/11 when the entire US airspace was shut down. You could hear the birds a lot more easily, and the sky was clear.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/the-day-after-what-9122001-was-like.html" target="_self">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/june04/geophen.html" target="_self">Geotimes, 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The empty skies also allowed David Travis of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and his co-workers to determine how contrails might be changing local temperature. Their results, first published in&#0160;<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/418601a.html" target="_self"><em>Nature</em>&#0160;in August 2002</a> and further elucidated last March in the&#0160;<em>Journal of Climate</em>, showed that during the days when jets were grounded in September 2001, sunshine increased the temperature at ground level instead of being reflected by contrails. At night, the researchers found, the absence of an insulating layer of contrails meant greater ground level cooling.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s hard to think that this happened more than a decade ago.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve always written better when there has been a deadline. Here&#39;s what I have on top of my mind on a chilly September morning, written over the span of about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago teachers are on strike</strong>. The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-strike-updates-pickets-up-as-more-talks-scheduled-20120910,0,4173856.story" target="_self">Chicago Tribune&#39;s live blog of the strike</a>&#0160;notes that 144 locations are open to handle kids that get free lunches and breakfasts, and that the CTA is offering free fares to students to get to those schools. Teachers are on the picket lines, chanting&#0160;&quot;What do we want? Fair contract. When do we want it? Now!&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Cuba had a power outage</strong> yesterday. An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/10/cuba-power-failure_n_1869373.html?utm_hp_ref=world" target="_self">AP story (via Huffington Post)</a>&#0160;says that &quot;millions&quot; were affected, for up to five hours. No explanation was given for the outage, and the <a href="http://radiohc.cu/ing/" target="_self">English language page of Radio Havana</a>&#0160;had no mention of the incident.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Arbor</strong>: <strong>Road construction</strong> continues all over town. The corner of Packard and Stadium is down to one lane in each direction, causing delays.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Isaac brought with it high winds and a substantial amount of rain, and both of those combined has led to a lot of flooding. Here are some maps I&#39;ve collected while the storm is still underway. You should know that for each of them I&#39;ll also give a link to the underlying mapping source so that you can get current information.</p>
<p>If you are in the affected area and need details about flooded roads or the risk of dams or levees bursting or anything else, <strong>do not trust this weblog for current information</strong>; seek out official and up to date sources.</p>
<p>Most of the maps are dated August 30, 2012, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>Rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for maps of observed precipitation is <a href="http://water.weather.gov" target="_self">water.weather.gov</a>, specifically the <a href="http://water.weather.gov/precip/" target="_self">AHPS</a> (Advanced Hydrometeorological Prediction Service). Here&#39;s a 7 day observed rainfall for Louisiana from that service, showing some areas with upwards of 20 inches of observed rainfall.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" /></a><br /><strong>Predicted rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for rainfall predictions running out to the next 5 days (120 hours) is the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/day1-5.shtml" target="_self">Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF).</a>&#0160;These models are updated several times a day and give rainfall estimates over the entire country. (Your rainfall will differ.) This is the run from Thursday, August 30, 2012, showing a predicted 5 day course for the remnants of Isaac to dump rain up the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-pi"><img alt="P120i00" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="P120i00" /></a><strong>Predicted flooding</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Serivce <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/wwa/" target="_self">Watch, Warning, Advisory Display</a>&#0160;shows this map with areas in pale green with warnings of potential floods, darker green (Arkansas) with current flood conditions, and parts of Louisiana and Mississippi with flash flood warnings. The accompanying text for some forecasts note that because of the dry and drought conditions the ground will be hard, and thus less able to absorb moisture leading to heavy runoff and flooding.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 13" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 13" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><strong>River gauges, current</strong></p>
<p>Many rivers have flood gauges which measure and report current flood status. This is a map from water.weather.gov&#39;s River Observations page showing the whole nation, with flooding marked in color. You can zoom in to individual observations as well.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-river-observations" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-river-observations" /></a><br />Here&#39;s a zoom of the New Orleans area for the same data. Please note that the gauges are only on rivers, and will not show flash flood areas, levee breaches, or other places where water is not usually found.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 11" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 11" /></a><br /><strong>Satellite imagery</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for satellite photos that show flooding; those usually don&#39;t appear until after the storm has cleared, because any imagery sensitive to water will pick up the clouds first. &#0160;Here&#39;s a NASA Aqua/MODIS image, pulled from their <a href="http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/rapid-response" target="_self">Rapid Response Imagery</a> datasets.</p>

<blockquote>The&#0160;<a href="http://thegalleryproject.com" target="_self">Gallery Project</a> presents&#0160;<em>Quantified Self</em>, a multimedia exhibit in which 34 local, regional, and national artists examine how individuals collect and often project information about themselves and others in the digital world. Artists examine the quantified self from two unique perspectives: one, how information about individuals is collected, stored, processed, and used by these individuals and communicated to others; and two how entities collect information about individuals and groups for commercial and other purposes. Examples are self-projections in cyber space, self-monitoring of health and other behaviors, obsessive collecting of self-defining artifacts, and visualizing personal and group data.</blockquote>

Artists that I recognized included <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/" target="_self">Edward Tufte</a> who had three very lovely prints from one of his books on display, and <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/" target="_self">Mark EJ Newman</a> who had some remarkably presented <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/" target="_self">cartograms</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Visit them at 215 S. Fourth Ave in downtown Ann Arbor, across from Eastern Accents (and thus handy to visit after A2B3).</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/post/2012/2012-08-23-hurricane-season-2012/">Hurricane season, 2012</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Each year is a new hurricane season, and each year the internet is a little different. Here&#39;s some things that are new that I&#39;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come. The word of the year is &quot;<a href="http://www.spaghettimodels.com" target="_self">spaghetti model</a>&quot;, illustrated below, showing a whole series of separate tracks from different atmospheric models to predict a set of possible futures for the storm.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-pi"><img alt="643281402" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="643281402" /></a><br />Another novel thing this year is the appearance of the hurricane app for your smart phone or iPad. <a href="http://kittycode.com/products/hurricane-hd/" target="_self">Hurricane HD</a>&#0160;for your iPad focuses solely on hurricane tracking, giving you alerts and forecasts and graphical updates as conditions change. (I haven&#39;t used it, but the screen shots look good and straightforward). The <a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/New-Hurricane-App-Brings-Safety-Information-to-Smart-Phones" target="_self">Red Cross Hurricane App</a>&#0160;includes&#0160;“I’m safe” messaging that allows users to broadcast reassurance to family and friends via social media outlets that they are out of harm’s way. Both have access to <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/" target="_self">NOAA Weather Radio</a>, which is one of the typical channels found on any of the scanner apps that are available.</p>
<p>If you are interested in listening to hurricane radio traffic, one good source is <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>. In addition to listening to police scanners and fire service radios, you can also tune into the <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?feedId=9559" target="_self">National Hurricane Center SKYWARN network</a>&#0160;and hear weather and condition reports directly from amateur radio operators in the field.</p>
<p>One thing that hasn&#39;t changed is the excellent hurricane coverage from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" target="_self">Weather Underground</a>, with the <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html" target="_self">weblog of Dr. Jeff Masters</a> a clear and precise account as conditions change. The comment board on this blog is notable for being well behaved and well informed, a rarity in this day and age. Weather Underground was recently purchased by Weather.com. There&#39;s no visible changes yet to hurricane information, but a few more TWC meteorologists are blogging on the wunderground site.</p>
<p>Here in Michigan, the worst we can expect from a hurricane is flooding from the far-north remnants of a storm. Others will not be so lucky. Do your best to be prepared.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect.</p>
<p>The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZxe-2rtOGo" target="_self">video from &quot;battlebauble&quot; on YouTube</a> looks convincing. We ended up picking out the bones after it had been cooked.</p>
<p>The trout was from the <a href="http://www.springvalleytroutfarm.com/" target="_self">Spring Valley Trout Farm</a> in Dexter, and the boys were there as part of Summers-Knoll summer &quot;Escape Camp&quot;.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/post/2012/2012-08-17-twitter-api-changes-cause-obvious-problems-for-developers/">Twitter API changes cause obvious problems for developers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &quot;I&#39;m eating a sandwich&quot;.) Here&#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.</p>
<p>From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &quot;<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes" target="_self">Interpreting some of Twitter&#39;s API changes</a>&quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application. His conclusion is stark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter has left themselves a lot of wiggle-room with the rules. Effectively, Twitter can decide your app is breaking a (potentially vague) rule at any time, or they can add a new rule that your app inadvertently breaks, and revoke your API access at any time. [...]</p>
<p>I sure as hell wouldn’t build a business on Twitter, and I don’t think I’ll even build any nontrivial&#0160;<em>features</em>&#0160;on it anymore.</p>
<p>And if I were in the Twitter-client business, I’d start working on another product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="http://app.net" target="_self">App.net</a> has grand designs to be a Twitter clone, based on three elements: a solid realtime engine for data, a well defined open API, and a subscription supported model (rather than an advertising supported model) for making the whole thing pay. Dalton Caldwell&#39;s manifesto is a worthwhile read, &quot;<a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal" target="_self">Announcing an audacious proposal</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe so deeply in the importance of having a financially sustainable realtime feed API &amp; service that I am going to refocus App.net to become&#0160;<strong>exactly that</strong>. I have the experience, vision, infrastructure and team to do it. Additionally, we already have much of this built: a polished native iOS app, a robust technical infrastructure currently capable of handing ~200MM API calls per day with no code changes, and a developer-facing API provisioning, documentation and analytics system. This isn’t vaporware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/global/" target="_self">alpha.app.net channel</a>&#0160;is full of want to be superstar application developers figuring out how their new idea could work in this new space.</p>
<p>There are two applications that I use that could be affected by this set of changes. One is Pinboard, which is a bookmarking tool that (among other things) reads and archives my Twitter stream. Pinboard&#39;s developer Maciej Ceglowski has a very funny, no holds barred <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard" target="_self">Twitter account for Pinboard</a>, where he among other things promotes his own service by retweeting posts from the accounts of his competitor Delicious. Here&#39;s his take on app.net:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 7" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 7" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;d be sad if my Twitter backups didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The unusual Twitter client that I use which is most likely to run up against the new look-and-feel guidelines of the Twitter API is <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/" target="_self">ttytter</a>, a command line client written in Perl by Cameron Kaiser. It looks nothing like the official Twitter apps of any kind.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 8" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 8" /></a><br />It&#39;s hard enough to insist on API and look-and-feel rules with applications that are user configurable; imagine what it must be like to enforce those rules when the application is delivered as relatively easy to modify source code. How can you make sure people don&#39;t break the rules if they can change their own code?</p>
<p>Twitter has some reasonable reasons to want to narrow the scope of what third parties can do with their service, but it&#39;s not going to come without a fight. Expect a tug of war between innovation and conformity, and it&#39;s safe to say that some of that innovation that comes at a high cost and low value to Twitter will be squashed out. I&#39;ll be particularly interested in the delicate balance between value provided by Twitter to advertisers (who pay directly) and social media marketers (who often ride for free) on the service.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m working on a lot of things, or so it seems, but right now I just want to write.</p>
<p>The working environment at the moment is the Chrome browser, with 6 tabs open. Two are Gmail accounts, one is Twitter, one is the Typepad dashboard from which I&#39;m writing this, and one is a Google Analtyics window set to &quot;real time&quot; view for Arborwiki. A sixth tab is currently on Google search, but it varies from time to time.</p>
<p>There are people who keep hundreds of open tabs, but I&#39;m not one of them - my usual plan for dealing with a surplus of work in progress is either to blog or twitter about it or to pin up a bookmark with Pinboard and then close the window.</p>
<p>Most notably from a productivity perspective is that Facebook doesn&#39;t fit into the picture. My Facebook stream has turned into a political circus, and I don&#39;t like wading through artful graphics making fun of politicians on all sides. It&#39;s tedious, and it makes me think that I could give up on Facebook mostly and not miss it.</p>

<p>The bike-trip planners for New York and Washington were built as demonstrations, said Kevin Webb, the Washington-based co-director of transportation at OpenPlans. Much of the technical work was already done for the Portland project, so it wasn’t a huge leap to create the new sites.</p>

      <p>How many people do you need to know before it&#39;s likely that two have the same full name?</p>
<p>The answer is going to depend critically on the pool of people you are sampling from, and whether you count people in multiple generations as Sr., Jr. as &quot;same name&quot;. Similarly, middle initials or middle names will be distinguishing marks. What I&#39;m after is less about collisions within a family and more about two John Jones in your addressbook, otherwise completely unrelated.</p>

<p>Power Grid Corporation of India&#39;s <a href="http://www.powergridindia.com/PGCIL_NEW/news.aspx" target="_self">press release on the subject</a> provides some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A disturbance occurred in the NR, ER and NER electricity grid at 1300 hours today leading to a blackout in these regions except survival of small pockets in Delhi, Kolkata, Narora etc. Supply to affected regions is being extended from Western and Southern Region grids. Presently supply to NR has been extended from Gwalior on Gwalior-Agra line up to Delhi stations. Supply to railway traction and metro has been restored to almost all the points. Hydro Stations in NR have been started and supply has restored up to Punjab and Haryana areas also. Startup supply has been extended to Singrauli, Rihand via Vindhyachal and startup supply to Talchar has been extended from Western Region It is expected that supply to all the major points in affected regions shall be made available in 2 to 3 of hours time.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Microcoworking is independent workers and freelancers working together at the same time in a coffee shop, sharing ideas and conversation. It&#39;s more informal than the coworking facilities that have sprung up all over the country, but it shares with them the idea that just because you&#39;re working on your own you don&#39;t have to be alone.</p>
<p>Today Laura Fisher, Patti Smith and I restarted a microcoworking cell that had been on hiatus for a while, meeting at Zingerman&#39;s Next Door. We did some editing work together, Patti and I, and Laura showed off her stylish <a href="https://www.sensubrush.com/" target="_self">Sensu brush</a> for the iPad. The music started out as a 70s mix which gave us all the appropriate flashbacks in time.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Thanks to Eli Neiburger for the heads up for this event -&#0160;</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor District Library is launching a new circulating collection of&#0160;electronic music tools, and they are brining &quot;<a href="http://moogfoundation.org/tag/dr-bobs-sound-school/" target="_self">Dr. Bob&#39;s Sound School</a>&quot;, a&#0160;program of the <a href="http://moogfoundation.org/" target="_self">Robert Moog Foundation</a>, to AADL this Wednesday August 1, 2012.&#0160;It&#39;s an introduction to the principles of electronic sound synthesis,&#0160;a little history of Moog, and a chance to get your hands on some&#0160;seriously cool and unusual music tools.</p>
<p>The instrument collection will feature musical gear that you can check out from the Library, from such noted manufacturers as Moog, Korg, Maywa Denki, Bleep Labs, Chamber of Sounds, Folktek, Critter &amp; Guitari and more! Participants in the workshop will get a chance to get their hands on these instruments before they go into general circulation.</p>
<p>One event is&#0160;intended for grades K-5 and their adults from 2-3:30 PM, and another&#0160;for grades 6 - Adult from 7 - 8:30 PM. &#0160;Details here:</p>
