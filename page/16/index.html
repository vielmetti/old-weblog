The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There's a list owner, who sets the rules.

If you've read newspaper comments, you'll know why already: they are awful. The world of Internet commenting offers a marvelous opportunity for discussion and the exchange of ideas. But as anyone who has ever ventured into a comment thread can attest, these forums too often turn into a morass of negativity, racism, hate speech and general trollish behaviors that detract from the content. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-13-the-chicago-sun-times-gives-up-on-newspaper-comments-for-now/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I am trying to write something about the sad state of local news, but it's pretty discouraging. A bad mix of unfiltered PR, unedited political invective, endless stenography, and tedium is par for the course. Why oh why don't we have a better press corps? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-10-the-sad-state-of-local-news/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every day, read the email. Answer, as best you can, yesterday's email. The yesterbox technique helps out, though it's not perfect. Follow interesting people on Twitter, but not too many interesting people. Manage the tricky relationship of "friending" people on Facebook, knowing full well once you have befriended someone it's a huge social transgression to unfriend them, even if you don't care for their particular brand of cat videos or politics. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-10-the-burden-of-diligence/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game "2048". (No, I won't link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating 2048 5D I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. 5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-07-how-are-you-going-to-keep-them-down-on-the-farm-after-theyve-seen-5d/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This list of Skywarn nets is compiled from a list of Skywarn Twitter feeds and Broadcastify radio feeds. Networks are added when there is confirmed traffic. KE4KMD maintains a similar list, which was used in part to develop this one. There is a national Skywarn directory at Skywarn.org.

        <p>Developed in 2008 by Brian Solis, The [Conversation Prism] is a visual map of the social media landscape. It’s an ongoing study in digital ethnography that tracks dominant and promising social networks and organizes them by how they’re used in everyday life. In 2009, I wrote up how the a2b3 lunch organizes itself through the eye of the this system. I ran across it again, and decided to do a repeat. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-30-the-2014-conversation-prism-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-a2b3-lunch/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This interview of Douglas Perlin, author of the a2parking Android application for locating Ann Arbor parking structures, was done via email. It is lightly edited to include hyperlinks. When did you get the idea to do an a2parking application, and how long did it take you to go from idea to first version? In October or November 2011 I was looking at the a2dda website and happened to see the parking space availability on one of the pages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-25-interview-with-douglas-perlin-author-of-a2parking-android-application/">&raquo;</a></p>
