<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/atlanta-snow-jam-2014-metro-commuters-recount-thei/nc5qF/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. And side streets? Even worse. Some people ditched their vehicles and set out on foot. Others tried to help stranded strangers. And many persevered, moving a few inches an hour toward home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, was set up to help stranded motorists, and it has spawned a <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zCPqWODXYzLY.kQ7WuEIEQXNs">Stranded Driver Shelter Map</a>, a clip of which is below.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Kroger, Walmart, and Home Depot have opened their stores as shelters, if you can get to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2622">Jeff Masters blog from Weather Underground</a> has the situation in detail.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dangerous winter storm swept through the Deep South on Tuesday, dumping 1 - 4" of snow and 1/4" - 1/2" of ice on a region unused to dealing with severe winter weather. Travel chaos resulted in many cities, and at least nine people died in storm-related accidents. Officially, 2.6" of snow fell at the Atlanta Airport from Winter Storm Leon, and snow amounts across the city ranged from 1.5" - 3.5". But with temperatures in the low 20s, and only 40 snow plows and 30 sand trucks to handle the snow, Atlanta streets and highways quickly turned into parking lots during the afternoon snow, as schools, businesses, and government offices all closed nearly simultaneously, sending a huge number of vehicles onto the roads. Atlanta experienced its worst traffic day of all-time, and thousands of motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles, with many spending the night sheltering in stores, stalled cars, or strangers' homes. A Facebook group dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, meant to connect stranded motorists with people willing to put them up for the night, had thousands of members by Tuesday night. Hundreds of children never made it home, and were forced to spend the night at their schools or at bus shelters. There were 940 confirmed traffic accidents in Atlanta, with more than 100 involving injuries, according to the Georgia public safety commissioner. It was Atlanta's worst driving day since the infamous Snow Jam of 1982, when 6" of snow also created traffic chaos, stranding thousands of motorists.</p>

      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c img-responsive" alt="Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon" title="Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>I'm rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it's easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.</p>

<p>So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945), David Sucher's "City Comforts" (2003), and <a href="http://www.mbenedikt.com/">Michael Benedikt</a>'s anthology "Cyberspace: First Steps" (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.</p>

<p>The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can't simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.</p>

<p>One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt's "Cyberspace". It's a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there's anything of common use that defines it, it's the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.</p>

<p>I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I'm stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that's true to the work? </p>

<p>One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for "vielmetti benedikt cyberspace" should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.</p>

<p>A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace">Goodreads</a> (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/31259">Librarything</a> (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20">Amazon</a>, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.</p>

<p>For every work, there's some chance that an echo of it will be online too; <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf">IEU in Turkey</a> has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.</p>

<p>What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? </p>

<p>I've carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What's more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.</p>

<hr/>

<p>noted as well:</p>

<p>An interview with Benedikt in <a href="http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;pff=1">AIGA</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.</p>

<p>I'm (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome. I wrote about it previously; it's an extension that suspends the processes of tabs you mark as inactive, so that they can be restored quickly. As a bonus, it's good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with "only" 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.</p>

<p>The Internet, in its infinite wisdom, has a lot of things competing for our attention. The only problem is that it's easy to save a tab group but as hard as ever to really mark a tab as closed. I'm sure there's some stable working set that I should keep going, but it's also satisfying to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet.html">decrease the n</a> by closing tabs.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the morning of 27 January 2014, AT&amp;T UVerse services appear to be suffering from DNS problems. A graph from <a href="http://downdetector.com/status/att">Down Detector</a> suggests that the problem is widespread. The observation is that some sites will load but others won't (like Hulu, New Yorker, Reddit.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Down-detector-att-2014-01-27-10.36.57-AM" title="Down-detector-att-2014-01-27-10.36.57-AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8). On my Mac, go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced ... > DNS and change the DNS server address.</p>

There are lots of reasons to want to use more art on this weblog. It's attractive, for one; it displays good taste to have interesting artwork to illustrate your points; and the reader who is tuned to the visual image has a lot more likelihood to appreciate a crisp image than they will a wall of text.

The hope is that the worst case is a DMCA takedown, and the best case is an artist who I'd ask permission of who would be thrilled to have a low resolution version of their illustration, photo, or artwork adorn this blog.</p>

<p>The artwork in question is from Jasper Johns; it's entitled 0-9 and, if the title of the image is to be believed, dates from 1958-1959. I don't know precisely which museum or collector owns this piece. If I can figure out exact credit, I'll share it. The image is used with the belief that a low resolution version of the original artwork is fair use. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>ABC News reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metro-North, the nation's second-busiest commuter railroad, was brought to a standstill for nearly two hours on Thursday night after computer problems caused signal issues system-wide, railroad officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/23/metro-north-service-suspended-on-hudson-harlem-and-new-haven-lines/">CBS</a> has this diagnosis of what went wrong, and why</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cause of the outage remained under investigation Thursday night. “We can’t say what the cause of it is. We’re still trying to figure that out,” Daniels told 1010 WINS.</p>

<p>For a good read on after-incident reporting, I always refer people to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/115136140203018391796">Postmortems</a> group on Google+ - it's an excellent source of descriptions of what happened when computers "glitch" (because they rarely glitch all by themselves).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MTA head Thomas Prendergast said Friday that computers that run Metro-North's signal system lost power at 7:45 p.m. Thursday when one of two main power supply units was taken out of service for replacement.</p>
  
  <p>He said technicians performing the work did not realize that a wire was disconnected on the other main power supply unit.﻿</p>

<p>The field is a lot longer - MGoBlog gives current UM Athletic Director David Brandon a 350-1 chance at getting the nod. The commenters are even less enthusiastic: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dave Brandon entering the presidency with zero academic administration experience, much less zero experience in the academy... Disaster. Dismantle the Diag, mothball the libraries, send everyone home.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a recipes collection.</p>
<p>This was part of dinner last week - yum! I don&#39;t have the exact proportions in front of me so you&#39;ll want to be prepared to improvise.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Potatoes</strong>, peeled, cut to quarters; to fill lasagna pan; redskins would do well <br />Juice of 3 <strong>lemons,&#0160;</strong><strong>fresh squeezed</strong>&#0160;juice not stuff from bottles if you have it&#0160;<br />Greek <strong>oregano </strong>(though Mexican oregano worked OK too) <br /><strong>Olive oil</strong> <br />Water</p>
<p>Preheat oven to a good roasting temperature (450+ degrees).</p>
<p>Put the potatoes in the lasagna pan. Mix lemon juice, water, oregano, oil together; you are after something like a salad dressing, but since you&#39;re baking it the water will go away, so make sure there&#39;s enough oil. Besides, olive oil is good for you.</p>
<p>Pour the dressing over the potatoes, mix until everything is coated. Put in oven. Roast until starting to turn brown, about 40-50 minutes depending on your oven and your potatoes. If you don&#39;t have a lot of oil in the dressing, you may need to turn to keep things from sticking.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll bet it would be good to put a couple of organic lemon halves in there too to roast along with everything.</p>
<p>Remove from oven, test for doneness. Eat. Yum. Also good cold.</p>
<p>Some other lemon roasted potato recipes, for comparison: <br />- <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/corby/ct2000-12.htm">Corby&#39;s Table</a> from The Atlantic Monthly has a patates riganates recipe from a review of Aglaia Kremezi&#39;s &quot;Foods of the Greek Islands&quot; <br />- <a href="http://www.sandisrecipecorner.com/recipe488H.htm">Sandi&#39;s Recipe Corner</a>, adds stock <br />- <a href="http://www.dvo.com/recipe_pages/grilln/Greek_Garlic_and_Lemon_Roasted_Potatoes.html">Cook&#39;n</a>, adds dill and roasts over wood chips <br />- <a href="http://www.autumnjade.com/recipes/133.htm">Autumn Jade</a>, basically the same with exact proportions <br />- <a href="http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2001/greek/potatoes.html">Global Gourmet</a> calls these <strong>patates riganates</strong> and adds garlic <br />- <a href="http://creampuffsinvenice.typepad.com/cream_puffs_in_venice/2006/04/some_lemony_spu.html">&quot;Cream Puffs in Venice&quot; has some lemony spuds for you</a>, adapted from <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/907079">Cook This</a> by Amy Rosen.</p>
<p>and I&#39;m sure there are more recipes to be had!</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>One more recipe to go with this if you have any cold leftovers. Put a bed of spring mixed greens on a plate; I like the Asian mix we found at Farmer&#39;s Market. Cut some of these potatoes up and put on top. Add diced cubed cold roasted beets for color and flavor. Dress with some of the lemon-oil mix, with a little red wine vinegar added. Yum.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-22-about-sidewalks/">About sidewalks</a>
      </h3>
      <p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? </p>

<p>The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner's street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so. </p>

<p>What these people wish to know, then, is, if the city owns the streets and their shade trees and side walks, why the city should not itself build the sidewalks, do all grading and plant all shade trees? </p>

<p>It is undeniable that when a man builds his sidewalk it immediately becomes city property, and he has no more ownership of it than any other citizen. In fact, in a single day hundreds will use it when he uses it once. In short, it is built not for him, but for the public. Then why should not the public pay for it? </p>

<p>The building of sidewalks under the existing ordinance is a heavy burden upon very many citizens, some of whom have been compelled by their circumstances to borrow the money at interest to enable them to comply with the order of the council. This seems to your correspondent to be a matter worthy of deliberate consideration by the city fathers. The claim of these people is that the city, owning the streets, should itself put down all sidewalks, and spread the expense upon he general tax. </p>

<p>It may do no good to open up this question at this time; but the voice of the people should at least be heard in the matter, and this communication certainly expresses it in some degree. </p>

      <p>Every once in a while, I come up with a really good idea. More often than not, I don't.</p>

<p>I'm content to work on systems that accommodate the work that leads to a steady sense of slow progress. The weblog piles one post upon another; every so often, the middle of the pile is most interesting, and you dust it off and bring it out again as if it were new. The wiki appreciates it when you fix a very small typo, change an "an" to an "a", tidy up a caption or resize a photo.</p>

<p>Progress is more often than not measured very slowly, if at all. Just try not to go backwards. </p>

<p>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It's fascinating to see people's attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.</p>

<p>What these tools don't easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. But that's a large part of the problem - the endless fascination gets in the way of applying fingers to the keyboard and creating something brand new.</p>

<p>It's easy to get distracted by the sorts of things that are meant to help you out. It's hard to be analytical and dispassionate about your past work while at the same time you're trying to create new work. Not everything worth writing has to rank highly on a search engine or get lots of referral traffic; sometimes, you just need to create something even if it's only for you to stretch your fingers. </p>

<p>I've been using a todo system <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">based on Github issues</a> for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be.</p>

<p>When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided that the only way to make progress on this list was to dramatically prune it. That means taking some items off the list that I really do want to do eventually, it's just that I'm not focusing on them now because every time I look at them on the list I say "no". Crossing them off the list doesn't completely delete them, and when I need to revisit them I can reopen the issue.</p>

<p>The list is down to 30 now, and I'm careful not to add more than that without crossing something else off the list. It still has a few lingering things that haven't been done for a long time, but I have had my teeth cleaned, and what's more I can read through the whole thing in one sitting and usually say "yes" to some next task.</p>

      </h3>
      <h2>Roasted broccoli salad with rice and feta</h2>

<p>For the rice: prepare 1.5 cups rice according to your taste. Do this first.</p>

<p>For the broccoli: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut a few heads of broccoli into bite sized florets. Mix in a bowl with olive oil, then place on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle sea salt on top. Roast 12-15 minutes until the broccoli is every so slightly browned on top.</p>

<p>For the garbanzos: Drain and rinse a can of garbanzos. Put in a small pot and cover with water. Heat until hot, then rinse again under cool water.</p>

<p>For the red peppers: Cut a red pepper into pieces about the size of a garbanzo bean.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Make a lemon vinaigrette with a little mint.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Some sweet chili paste, or gochujang, or your favorite spicy sauce.</p>

<p>For the feta: crumble some feta.</p>

<p>Serve in individual bowls on the table, for people to mix their own salads. If your family is like mine, someone will eat just rice and peppers and beans, someone else will prefer the salad without feta, someone will want a vinaigrette and someone else (me) will douse the whole thing with chili sauce. Enjoy!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dorsey has said DEP officials began an investigation after receiving odor complaints from nearby residents starting at about 8:15 a.m. The DEP and Kanawha County emergency officials traced the odors to Freedom Industries, which had not self-reported any sort of leak or accident, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>In an air-quality enforcement order, the DEP said air-quality officials who arrived at the site at 11:10 a.m. "discovered that no spill containment measures had been initiated and that an accumulating MCHM leak pool was seeping thru a dike wall adjacent to the Elk River and a downstream oil sheen was observed."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- As hundreds of thousands of residents in and around the Kanawha Valley struggle with the "do not use" order from West Virginia American Water Co., one stubborn fact continues to frustrate residents and some local health officials alike: No one seems to be able to say for sure what the coal-cleaning chemical that's been dumped into our water supply might do to us.</p>
  
  <p>Water company officials have identified the chemical -- which leaked from a Freedom Industries tank just upstream from the regional drinking-water intake on the Elk River -- as something called "Crude MCHM." That material is made up almost entirely of another chemical, 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol.</p>
  
  <p>Material-safety sheets from several manufacturers list little in the way of health information. Toxicological databases provide few answers.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b img-responsive" alt="Indianapolis-Power-Light-2014-01-08-outage-map" title="Indianapolis-Power-Light-2014-01-08-outage-map" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>The world of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/12/lansing-michigan-lbwl-crowdsourced-power-outage-map-of-29-december-2013.html">BWL</a>, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult.</p>

<p>If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. Here too there's no one centralized resource to make that happen. What there is, however, is a very efficient system developed by a world where making that power go back on is important - the nation's utility lineman.</p>

<p>There is a company, <a href="http://linemanbarn.com/">Lineman Barn</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lineman.barn">Facebook page</a> that tracks all kinds of storm-related damage and helps people who do that work connect to each other and find work. (Lineman Barn sells logo clothing for the trade.) When a storm hits, you'll see periodic updates every 6 to 24 hours of utilities that have lines down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Established in 2003 to bring pride and recognition to the trade, Lineman Barn is the First Choice of Linemen and their families for custom shirts, hats, decals, gifts, JOBS and Lineman Safety News.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without further ado here are the outage numbers from January 6, 2014, at noon. Note that many of these utilities have maps that you can see on the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> page. 
By my count that's 150,192 lines out nationwide.</p>

<p>It's bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. </p>

<p>One of the things we're looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the <strong>emerald ash borer</strong> that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the <a href="http://thegazette.com/2014/01/07/ash-borer-larvae-in-iowa-will-survive-cold-snap-scientists-say/#sthash.ZsDtIacT.dpuf">The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa)</a> has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Minnesota, where arctic outbreaks are colder, more frequent and last longer, they do inhibit the spread of the emerald ash borer, according to Lee Frelich, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology.</p>
  
  <p>In parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota, frequent, protracted cold spells may actually establish a zone in which ash trees can survive, Frelich said....</p>
  
  <p>Citing recent research conducted in Minnesota, Frelich said 5 percent of emerald ash borer larvae die when exposed to a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The mortality rate increased to 34 percent at 10 below, to 79 percent at 20 below and 98 percent at 30 below, according to that research.</p>
  
  <p>However, the exposure must last at least several hours to overcome the insulating effect of the bark beneath which the larvae live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More details on <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/updraft/2014/01/extreme-cold-may-wipe-out-high-percentage-emerald-ash-borer-larvae/">Minnesota Public Radio News</a>, again from Frelich:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the forecast temperatures that we will experience in the next several days will cause a lot of mortality for emerald ash borer in MN. Details below–probably more than you need. I looked up the most recent research this morning, because I figured I will get a lot of questions about this over the next week.</p>
  
  <p>Winter mortality for emerald ash borer is definitely temperature dependent. The larvae can supercool to a certain point, but they die if they freeze, and there is variability in tolerance among individual insects. A recent study from the Forest Service (Venette and Abrahamson–see attached) in Minnesota showed that 5% of the insects die at 0F, 34% at -10F, 79% at -20F and 98% at -30F.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent study is <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5191794.pdf">Venette and Abrahamson, Cold Hardiness Of Emerald Ash Borer, AGRILUS PLANIPENNIS: A new perspective</a>. The abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study was designed to assess the cold hardiness of emerald ash borer larvae, the 
  overwintering stage of the insect. We began by measuring larval supercooling points, the 
  temperatures at which larvae freeze. We found that larvae collected from naturally infested trees in St. Paul, MN between late October and early December had an average supercooling point of -25°C (-13°F). Research elsewhere indicates that when these insects freeze, they die. Our laboratory assessments of cold hardiness were confirmed during field tests. Naturally infested logs were held outdoors in St. Paul, MN (low winter air temp=-28°C) and near Grand Rapids, MN (-34°C) for ca. 5.5 weeks. Approximately 40% of larvae from logs in St. Paul were inactive or brown, both evidence of death; approximately 90% of larvae from logs near Grand Rapids were inactive or brown, compared with the approximately 10% that showed evidence of death prior to exposure or after being held under cool, non-lethal conditions. Overwintering mortality 
  may help to minimize the damage caused by emerald ash borer in areas with extremely cold 
  winter climates. </p>

<p>So there you go; the colder the weather, the more of the bugs die.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours).</p>

<p>I put the raw potato strips into a big bowl, pour some olive oil on them, and mix until everything is nicely coated, then put them onto cookie sheets and cook for what seems like a long time in a 425 degree F oven. If you want equally crispy on both sides, turn them over part way through. They would be good with a sprinking of sea salt.</p>

<p>Some more recipes, not that you need much of a recipe.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today.html">yesterbox</a>. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done.</p>

<p>The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. Alas, things go onto this list and stay there forever. How to reconcile the two?</p>

<p>What I'm going to try, as best I can, is to deal with today's bright ideas about what I need to do but don't have time to do right now tomorrow. There will be a finite number of things to look at, and I can probably deal with some of them right away. I don't mean to kick the can down the road, but I also don't want to try to tackle everything I've ever thought of doing all at once.</p>

<p>Inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.wallofvoodoo.net/">Wall of Voodoo</a> song "Tomorrow".</p>

<p>I'll do it tomorrow / that seems like a pretty good idea to me</p>
