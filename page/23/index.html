<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>I'm working with a few other folks on setting up a relatively regular local group that has discussions of tools like Google Analytics and other systems used to instrument web sites and web applications. We're looking at a date in January 2014 to start, and a Wednesday as the day of the week we think might work best. Let me know if you're interested, or join the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ann-Arbor-Web-Analytics-Wednesday/events/151859352/">Ann Arbor Web Analytics Wednesday meetup</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Tasty_Green_Cafe">Tasty Green Cafe</a> inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment).</p>

<p>Lunch (a meat pie and a coke) was $5.01. </p>

<p>I talked briefly with City Attorney <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Stephen_Postema">Stephen Postema</a> and his thoughts on proposed FOIA legislation coming from Lansing (he's skeptical). I told him about my new <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/11/welcome-to-foia-friday.html">FOIA Friday column on Damn Arbor</a>, and he recognized Damn Arbor because it once wrote about his <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2011/04/what-if-anything-is-hipster.html">status as a hipster</a> (he's not).</p>

<p>Environmental Coordinator <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Matt_Naud">Matt Naud</a> and I talked about the upcoming <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech meetup</a>, and he referred me to the <a href="https://www.wegowise.com/">WeGoWise</a> program in Boston that's reducing people's energy and water bills - similar, in spirit at least, to the <a href="https://dteenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=26817&amp;item=72330">OPower insert</a> in my recent DTE bill that told us we used a lot of electricity compared to our neighbors.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222614&amp;GUID=3890EFBC-18C0-4B89-A44B-B72A3143DAD5&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting agenda</a> for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.</p>

<p>As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/13/nov-18-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a>. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/repeal_of_ann_arbors_controver.html">Ann Arbor News story</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.m. it's not on the agenda, but Ann Arbor News reporter Ryan Stanton suggests on twitter that the disposition of the Old Y Lot may make it onto the agenda tonight, with council asked to accept the Dahlmann bid. 5:05 p.m. Now on the PDF agenda as "DC-4 13-1467 Resolution to Approve Sale of City-Owned Property at 350 S. Fifth to Dennis A. Dahlmann (8 Votes Required)".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Word is that Dennis Dahlmann has accepted all of the city&#39;s terms and Y Lot sales agreement could be voted on tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=hash">#a2council</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Stanton (@ryanjstanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton/statuses/402543766415757312">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This will be the first meeting for new City Council member Jack Eaton, who defeated Twenty Pound Carp in the general election in November 2013.</p>

<p>Council will appoint a Mayor Pro Tem, to serve as acting Mayor when there is no mayor available. Traditionally this has gone to the most senior member of council by tenure, and I think that might be Margie Teall; the Chronicle hints that Jane Lumm might have the nod.</p>

<p>MC-1 Mayoral appointments look uncontroversial.</p>

<p>PH-1, B-1 "Pizza in the park", a waiver of fees for parks activities that provide basic human services, looks like it's likely to pass based on last week's discussion.</p>

<p>PH-2, B-2 "DDA Revisions" is probably going to take a long time, as various members of council try to make political points regarding the relative balance of services between the downtown and the neighborhoods. Make popcorn.</p>

<p>CA-1 "The Puck Drops Here" is a 31 December 2013 event (details?) to be held just before the 1 January 2014 Winter Classic NHL hockey game.</p>

<p>CA-2 "Hockey is just like football" as far as parking restrictions and street closings goes.</p>

<p>CA-3 Dawn Farm has agreed to acquire 618 N. Main from Avalon Housing.</p>

<p>DC-1 "Ypsi Township on AAATA board" Council gets to decide whether Ypsilanti Township has a seat on the AAATA transit authority board. It was a matter of controversy when it came up the first time; keep up with the popcorn.</p>

<p>DC-4 "Dahlmann proposal for Old Y Lot" This showed up on the agenda at the last possible moment, to the point where it's not clear that members of council will get a chance to read it before voting on it; certainly no one had a chance to put their name in for public commentary on this item. I'm hopeful that this resolution will be postponed until next time for a vote.</p>

<p>DS-2, DS-3, DS-4 Easement swaps with the University of Michigan for a new conduit through the Arboretum, and a new survey to settle a disputed boundary between the city and the university. </p>

<p>G-1. The Greenbelt Advisory Commission has minutes to approve from 2011 (!!!).</p>

<p>G-2. The Public Art Commission has minutes to approve from January and Feburary 2012 (!!!)</p>

<p>G-6, G-7, G-8, G-9 The Taxicab board has been very slow to produce minutes; these date back to January 2013.</p>

<p>Not on the agenda yet is a possible purchase agreement for the "Old Y Lot".</p>

      <p>As monitored via the <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/681">Lapeer County Michigan scanner</a> and via Twitter, there is a large fire in downtown <a href="http://www.ci.lapeer.mi.us/">Lapeer, Michigan</a>. I'm listening to the scanner and the fire is being actively fought, and there are over 700 people listening to the stream. The <a href="http://www.pixlapeer.org/">PIX Theater</a> is the center of firefighting efforts, as far as I can tell. </p>

<p>This is a snapshot of news coverage at 9:15 pm Eastern on November 12, 2013, and is bound to be updated by local media as details emerge.</p>

<p>Many further details about the devastation of Haiyan (Yolanda) on the Philippines can be found in the <a href="http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Typhoon_Haiyan_2">Al Jazeera live blog Typhoon Haiyan Live</a>. As of 10 November 2013 there are reported estimates of the dead as a result of this storm exceeding 10,000 people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there have been preliminary estimates of 10,000 dead in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. "Local government officials think the number could reach 20 or 30 thousand people," Al Jazeera's Margot Ortigas reported from Manila.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE: Weather reports from Dr Jeff Masters at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2576">Weather Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a preliminary death toll of 1,200, Haiyan already ranks as the 8th deadliest typhoon in Philippines history. The deadliest typhoon in Philippines history was Typhoon Thelma of 1991, which killed between 5101 - 8000 people, reports wunderground's weather historian Christopher C. Burt in his latest post on Philippines typhoon history. Haiyan will become the deadest typhoon in Philippines history if the estimates today of 10,000 dead hold up. Bloomberg Industries is estimating insured damages of $2 billion and total economic damages of $14 billion, making Haiyan the most expensive natural disaster in Philippines history. This is the third time in the past 12 months the Philippines have set a new record for their most expensive natural disaster in history. The record was initially set by Typhoon Bopha of December 2012, with $1.7 billion in damage; that record was beaten by the $2.2 billion in damage done by the August 2013 floods on Luzon caused by moisture associated with Typhoon Trami.</p>

<p>Former Milwaukee Brewers executive Edmund Bacon Fitzgerald, known as "Younger Ed" to distinguish him from his father, died in September 2013 at the age of 87. Fitzgerald helped bring baseball back to Milwaukee in 1970 after the departure of the Braves; the ship was named after his father, an executive with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance.

  <p>On the 30th anniversary of the wreck in 2005, he recalled meeting Lightfoot at a dinner hosted by the Canadian prime minister in the 1980s.  "I told him what my name was, and he looked rather surprised," Fitzgerald said of the Canadian singer-songwriter. Fitzgerald called Lightfoot's homage to the ship a "fine song."</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Because of the election on Tuesday 5 November 2013, the Ann Arbor City Council will be meeting on Thursday 7 November 2013. Here's a preview of sorts of the agenda. Note that the agenda is subject to change up until the very last minute, though in general it stabilizes well before that.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/04/nov-7-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a> is well worth a read.</p>

<p>The agenda, in order, noting only interesting items. Your idea of what is interesting may differ. This posting may be updated from time to time as more details emerge.</p>

<p>MC-1, Mayoral appointments. Nothing obviously controversial here. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Cyndi_Clark">Cyndi Clark</a> is proposed to fill a vacancy on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ann_Arbor_DDA">Ann Arbor DDA</a> board; she's the owner of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Lily_Grace">Lily Grace</a>.</p>

<p>B-1. DDA Ordinance. Four items of substance in the proposed revision (as of v3): 1) Remove the mayor from the DDA board as of the end of the current mayor's term, and replace with the city administrator. 2) Recalculate TIF funding mechanism and the return of surplus funds to taxing entities.  3) "Requires a nexus between development programs and specifically benefited properties within the downtown development district." 4) Requires TIF report in January, and requires DDA programs to be part of the city's Capital Improvement Project (CIP) process. Expect this to take a long time to sort out.</p>

<p>C-1. "Pizza in the Park". Changes the Parks ordinance to omit fees for events "where the permitted event's primary proposed activity is the charitable distribution of goods for basic human needs." Permits are still required.</p>

<p>DC-1. "Stadium Billboard". Directs the city administrator to complain to the University of Michigan about the new digital billboard on E Stadium Blvd near Michigan Stadium.</p>

<p>DC-3. "Ethics". Directs the city administrator and city attorney to educate city council on professional conduct, and directs the Council Rules Committee to draft standards of conduct.</p>

<p>DS-10. Design the Scio Church Road sidewalk, $35,000 from general fund.</p>

<p>THE ENERGY IN DETROITS ASSETS</p>

<p>LED BY Dr. Jill Van Horn</p>

<p>Mark Day remarks to the Board:</p>

<p>"What is it that fixes the potential of the asset, so that it can put additional production into motion?"</p>

<p>What detaches value from a simple old plant such as Packard and fixes Detroiters to realize it as capital?</p>

<p>We can begin to finally answer by using an energy analogy that was put forth by Hernando Deesoto.</p>

<p>Consider Mountain Lake we can think about this lake in its immediate physical context and see come primary use for it such as canoeing and fishing.</p>

<p>But when we think about this same lake as an engineer would, by focusing on its capacity to generate energy as an additional value beyond the lakes natural state as a body of water. We suddenly see the potential created by the lakes elevated position. The challenge for the engineer, is the same challenge that all Detroiters face today, finding out how he can create a process that allows him to convert and fix this potential into a form that can be used to do additional work. IN the case of the elevated lake, that process is contained in a hydroelectric plant that allows the lake water to move rapidly downward with the force of gravity. Thereby transforming the placid lakes potential into the kinetic energy of tumbling water. This electric magnets that further convert into electrical energy.</p>

<p>As electricity, the potential energy of the Placid Lake is now fixed in the form necessary to produce controllable current that can be further transmitted through wire conductors in faraway places to display new production. Apparently Placid Lake can be used to light your room and power the machinery in a factory.</p>

<p>What was required was an external man made process that allowed us, first, to identify the weight of the water, second, convert this potential energy into electricity, which can then be used to create surplus value. The additional value we obtain form the lake I not the value of the lake itself, but rather the value of the manmade process intricate of the lake.</p>

<p>It is the process that allows us to transform the lake form a canoeing and fishing kind of place into an energy producing kind of place. Detroit's assets, like energy, also have a dormant value.</p>

<p>Bringing them to life requires Detroiters to go beyond looking at the city's asset as they are actively thinking about them as they could be.</p>

<p>It required a sophisticated process for fixing Detroit's assets economical potential into a form that can be used to make additional production. Although the process to convert the potential energy in the water into electricity is well known. The one that gives Detroit's assets the form required to put in motion. More production is not known, in other words while we know that it is the pin stop, turbaned, generators, transformers, and wires of the hydro-electric energy system, that convert the potential energy of the lake until it is fixed in a accessible form. We do not know where to find the key process that connects the economic potential of that Detroiters can benefit from.</p>

<p>This is because that key process has never been deliberately set up for Detroiters. Under the development plans that Jill Van Horn has co designed for Detroit. The city will develop through a variety of financial mechanisms that gradually will combine into a process that will churn out capital as never before.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese, Chinese and our financiers on Wall Street use their mechanisms all the time. Detroiters do not realize that none of the essential capital generating functions is being utilized in their area. Historically Detroiters used them as parts of the Banking and Financial system, but not as interlocking mechanism for fixing the economic potential of Detroit's assets in such a way that they can be converted into capital for all Detroiters benefit.</p>

<p>This may sound complex, but consider the Penobscot building that sold for approximately
5 million dollars, but contains more than 1,000,000 square feet of luxurious office space. Then consider single family housing selling for $1,000.00 which contained more than 1,600 square feet. Then consider entire city block that are being sold for 100.00 a lot, further consider the millions of square feet in apartment buildings scattered throughout the city. Finally consider the fact that Detroit is in Bankruptcy and so is its sister city Hyland Park.</p>

<p>Now is not the time for native Detroiters to bicker over the price of the Packard Plant. Now is the time to form a coalition made of past and future developers in order to make a change in Detroit. Utilizing the private investors, the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, International Bankers, and Faith Based Organizations located through the city to pull it up by its boot straps and make it whole again.</p>

<p>Dr Van Horn has assembled the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, Private Investors and several Foundations, who intend to merge their financial resources with the local developers in Detroit, to transform the dormant capital the lies in every real estate parcel in the city of Detroit, into a fixed value of capital that will benefit all of the cities residence.</p>

<p>Prior to placing the bid on the Packard Plant, Dr. Van Horn's prophecy was to resurrect Detroit by providing education, jobs and vocational training to the city's residence, simultaneously unplugging the financial arteries of the city.</p>

<p>That decision was based on the gravity of the hour and the magnitude of potential jobs that the plant offers for the people of Detroit.</p>

<p>"Any intelligent foal can make things bigger, more complex and more violent. it takes a touch of genius-- and a let of courage to move in the opposite direction." Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Dr. Van Horn's partners consist of all af the non--profit developers who elther own land or have designated development areas within the city. Furthermore, if the county doubts that we have the ability to perform, we challenge the caunty by stating at this time, Dr. Van Horn and her lenders, investors are prepared to travel fram Texas to Detroit and sit down with the county and make an offer for every vacant, abandoned and dilapidated apartment building within Detroit. Not only are we prepared to show that we have the ability to perform, but we are ready to perform.</p>

<p>2012 was a disaster for Michigan apple growers, but 2013 has been a good year. From <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131024/ARTICLE/131029937">Capital Press</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.</p>
  
  <p>Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.</p>
  
  <p>“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the limiting factors in the apple harvest is the availability of seasonal workers to pick the crop. Last year was a bad year and some migrants resettled to other states. From <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/michigan_apple_crop_migrant_wo.html">MLive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market demand also will play a role in determining how many apples are left in the fields or sent to packers and processors, said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee that represents some 850 family-owned orchards.</p>
  
  <p>Smith estimates the apple harvest workforce is short about 20 percent. Labor has been the industry's top concern for many years, since it's tough to find an adequate skilled workforce, she said, adding that immigration policies that allow migrant workers to go back and forth between the U.S. and their home countries would help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://record-eagle.com/latest-mobile/x1909741911/Migrant-worker-shortage-hits-orchards-in-Traverse-City-area/print">Traverse City Record-Eagle</a> notes the impact in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some affected growers, particularly in the Grand Rapids area, are prioritizing and picking only varieties that have the best financial return, said Jim Bardenhagen, an area fruit and vegetable farmer and retired 20-year Leelanau County extension director.</p>
  
  <p>Bardenhagen said several area farmers told him that only about half of migrant workers needed to pick apples in the region came to northwestern lower Michigan this year and that many are new to the work. He personally lost only one worker in his crew of three. Area crews generally can vary from about five to 30.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a good year to look for orchards that are doing a gleaner's harvest to donate to local food banks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I deeply appreciate city council's dedication to a balanced budget and basic services, we cannot simply save our way to success. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Pfizer">Post-Pfizer</a>, Ann Arbor must increase its tax base by supporting a strong and diversified economy of high-growth, high tech companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In January 2007, Pfizer announced that the Ann Arbor facilities -- primarily a large campus on Plymouth Road -- would be closing by the end of 2008. The University of Michigan purchased the Pfizer campus, turning it into the North Campus Research Complex.</p>

Pick up a copy of "<a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/newgeographyofjobs/">The New Geography of Jobs</a>" from <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> to understand the multiplier effect high tech jobs have on local business, and why place matters.</p>

<p>Borders was an Ann Arbor based bookstore that grew from a single store into a worldwide bookselling leader. It closed its doors in 2011 after 40 years in business. This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/12/first.borders.bookstore.closing/index.html">CNN story</a> gives a good history of its rise and fall. <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> is an independent bookstore that opened in Ann Arbor in 2013, inheriting several former Borders employees and a number of its bookshelves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As CEO of a fast-growing high tech company, and mentor and advisor to many other innovative, venture-backed startups here, I can personally testify to the challenges of building a company downtown. All of my prior companies have been split between Ann Arbor and elsewhere, with most of their economic impact (hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs, services, investment, and spin-offs) outside of Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of Dug's prior companies was <a href="http://arbornetworks.com">Arbor Networks</a>, which split itself between Ann Arbor and the Boston area. Arbor was <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2010-press-releases/1994-tektronix-communications-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbor-networks">acquired in 2010</a> by Tektronix Communications, a division of Danaher. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to see us reverse that trend. We have had far too many world-changing technology companies start in Ann Arbor, but leave to grow their people and fortunes elsewhere. It's often for the most mundane of reasons that 20- and 30-somethings here understand all too well.</p>
  
  <p>We need a city council that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, open governance, and good kindergarten skills, but also promotes a vision of positive growth for our community. In today's economy, if we aren't busy growing, we're just slowly dying, and I've been terrified by the Tea Party-like obstructionism I've seen from council members on issues of development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "Tea Party" label has been applied to opponents on City Council before, most notably via the anonymous weblog "Middle of the Left" which uses the term <a href="http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/">Teapublicans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, I support Kirk Westphal, Democratic candidate in Ward 2 for Ann Arbor city council. His vision of a vital, walkable downtown supporting diversity, density, and dynamism is a recipe for <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/">placemaking</a>, and a natural engine for economic growth. We need downtown Ann Arbor to be a real place again and not just a hollowed-out franchise of Traverse City minus the bay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference to "franchise of Traverse City" alludes to several TC based businesses that have set up shop in Ann Arbor, including Cherry Republic and the restaurants Blue Tractor and Jolly Pumpkin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A vote for Kirk is a vote for progress!</p>

  <p>How did my WILD Saturday night OFF WORK go? Celebrated my friend's, Sarita LH,birthday who is a medic as well with my other awesome medic buddy Tim Skeeters at Rush Street in Ann Arbor. While we were having a great time, 2 gun shots were fired on the dance floor. While everyone stampeded away from the dance floor, we rushed towards it. Before we can think twice we were atop the shooter and the victim. As far as the gentleman who was shot in the abdomen, he with conscious and alert with 2 other great medics stopping the bleeding and keeping him awake. We, then successfully backboarded and loaded the patient. Literally 2 hours later my shift began and now back at work, however getting paid for it this time. </p>

  <p>A review by The Wall Street Journal of more than 100,000 of the roughly three million FOIA requests filed over the past five years, including all of those sent to the FDA, shows that investors use the process to troll for all kinds of information.

<p>Sam Kriss has a wonderful <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/book-of-lamentations/">reading of the psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-5</a>, treating it as a dystopian novel. In the "Book of Lamentations", he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something has gone terribly wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any real fulfillment. The newly published DSM-5 is a classic dystopian novel in this mold.</p>
  
  <p>It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an unwieldy mouthful: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The author (or authors) writes under the ungainly nom de plume of The American Psychiatric Association – although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone; within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd, chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.</p>

<li>The most recent inspection and safety reports for the eighty one
(81) street lighting poles referenced in City Council item 13-1062
that were proposed to be replaced, referencing the following Whereas
clause:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas: The Street Lights along Main Street between Huron and
  William are rusting at the base posing a safety issue and are in need
  of replacement; "</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this request is in the public interest, and since the records
have been freshly examined for staff preparation for council, I expect
that the records will be readily available at no charge.</p>

<p>I do not know if the records are in electronic form. If they are in
paper form, and if duplication of records would be necessary to
fulfill this request, please inform me before proceeding so that I can
weigh the costs. If possible, if the records are in paper form I would
like to examine them in person to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

<p>Thanks for your prompt response to this request.</p>

      <p>I have the window open, I'm typing, and there's nothing to write about. Despite that constraint, I'm going to write 750 words. You don't have to read them, this is mostly just for me.</p>

<p>Hey, some links! That's always good for a few words.</p>

<p>Ryan Burns is working on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Playgrounds">Arborwiki "Playgrounds" page</a>. Snap a photo of a playground and add it in!</p>

<p>The Australian bush is still on fire near Sydney. Google has an <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-nsw-bushfires">NSW Bushfires crisis map</a> tracking fire progression.</p>

<p>Daylight Savings Time ends on Sunday, November 3rd, 2013, at 2am. It can't end too quickly for me.</p>

<p>The apple crop in SE Michigan is exceptionally good this year, after last year's horrible crop. From <a href="http://www.goodfruit.com/Good-Fruit-Grower/Web-2013/Large-US-apple-crop-forecast/">GoodFruit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, Michigan produced only 2.7 million bushels of apples, a tenth of a normal crop. This year, the Guesstimate was for a crop of 26.3 million bushels, a number only surpassed once in the last eight years. Michigan’s crop has been highly variable for the last decade, but averages around 20 million bushels.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor City Council decided not to spend general fund money on downtown Ann Arbor street lamps, after inspection of the lamps showed that some of them were rusting at the base. I filed a FOIA request to get recent safety inspection reports.</p>

<p>A friend on the west coast sold his Bitcoin mining equipment, recovering some of the cost of that gear. He reports that mining is very expensive and very competitive and that the remaining money to be made on Bitcoin is in currency speculation.</p>

<p>Speaking of bubbles, the new book "The Map And The Territory" by former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan is out. Brad Delong has been reading it, and he reports that the word "<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/10/alan-greenspan-fraud-in-the-map-and-the-territory.html">fraud</a>" only shows up three times in the book.</p>

<p>Baseball season is over for the Detroit Tigers and manager Jim Leyland has stepped down. Speculation turns to who the next manager will be.

<p>It's not unusual that over a thousand people will be listening to the <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/763">Chicago police scanner</a> late at night on Broadcastify.</p>

<p>The city elections are coming up in Ann Arbor, and the most heated contest is between incumbent independent Jane Lumm and her Democratic challenger, Kirk Westphal. Democratic partisans have engaged in mud-slinging against Lumm and other members of council, smearing them with the <a href="http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/">Teapublican</a> label. </p>

<p>A recent earthquake in Bohol, Philippines has 209 dead and over 600 injured, according to <a href="http://earthquake-report.com/2013/10/15/very-strong-earthquake-mindanao-philippines-on-october-15-2013/">Earthquake Report</a>.</p>

<p>Grambling's student newspaper, <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/gramblinite.php">the Gramblinite, is in the news</a> after students were suspended from the paper after alleged ethics violations. The university backtracked, rescinding the punishments, but not before they helped draw attention to photos of school facilities in decay. The <a href="http://www.theshadowleague.com/articles/grambling-players-keep-legacy-of-hbcu-protesting-alive">Grambling football team protested</a> by refusing to travel to an away game. Players say they got staph infections from mold and mildew on training equipment.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some stories that I'm watching about what's on the Ann Arbor City Council agenda for 21 October 2013.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="A2council-pun-plamondon-1973-a2snooze-cropped" title="A2council-pun-plamondon-1973-a2snooze-cropped" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>As usual, the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/20/oct-21-2013-ann-arbor-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a> is a useful guide to the details, and the <a href="https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222612&amp;GUID=EBFC5C3E-0504-4B72-95C6-12815612D619&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting details from Legistar</a> give you the play-by-play.</p>

<p>The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site. Keystone won the RFP, beating out Flight Plan Creative of Traverse City ($24,650) and B+B Marketing Communications of Midland ($40,000). It is to be noted that the award did not go to the low bidder, as the qualifications for the RFP spelled out that price was not the only consideration for the bid.</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township is seeking to join The Ride (The Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority, or AAATA). Vivienne Armentrout has posted an <a href="http://localinannarbor.com/2013/10/19/once-again-aaata-exceeds-its-reach/">article critical of the expansion</a> which drew a stern rebuke from Larry Krieg of Ypsi Township:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an era when we can’t afford either to isolate our communities or to link them solely by private automobiles, the clear path to prosperity in Michigan is through regional cooperation and investing together in alternative forms of transportation. We can’t afford <em>not</em> to make this investment now. Those who think it’s foolish to diversify our transportation options are neglecting the huge expense of our current dependence on automobiles and petroleum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm all for improved service to Ypsilanti Township, but that's at least a little selfish. If service to that part of the area improves, it will be in part due to improvements in service on AAATA Route 5, which goes right by my house. If I lived on the west side of Ann Arbor, I'd be agitating for Scio Township to buy in to transit improvements, because that would likely add to the quality of service of west-side bus routes.</p>

<p>What's not on the agenda is perhaps as important as what's on the agenda. This week's agenda as printed Sunday night does not have any talk of a repeal of the city crosswalk ordinance. That's been getting a lot of press, including this <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/10/stay-vigilant-for-coming-attacks-on.html">piece in Damn Arbor</a> suggesting additional signage to improve motorist recognition of local ordinances. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/10/efforts_underway_to_repeal_ann_arbors_crosswalk_ordinance.html">dot News story</a> suggests that a motion to repeal the ordinance might be on the council's November agenda, perhaps after the elections when there's new faces on the council.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="http://a2gov.org/ctn">CTN</a> is your source for online city council video, and the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council">a2council</a> hash tag on Twitter can help you follow along with the play by play.</p>

      <p>Bush fires are burning in New South Wales, Australia in October 2013. If you are near the fire, you must find a more accurate and timely source of information than this blog post.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24575830">BBC report</a> quotes from a local official:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that "the speed and the ferocity" of the fires was something "not seen for many, many years".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of this writing, the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/more-than-100-homes-destroyed-conditions-set-to-worsen-20131018-2vshk.html">Sydney Morning Herald report</a> is that more than 100 homes have been lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alongside him on Sunny Ridge Road, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes the epic scale of these fires: 86,000 hectares burnt; fire perimeters stretching 400 to 500 kilometres; 94 fires still burning at 2.20pm, 27 uncontained and two with emergency warnings, one on the central coast and one nearby, threatening Springwood High School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google's <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-nsw-bushfires">crisis map of the New South Wales fires</a> is a mirror of the <a href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?CAT_ID=683">New South Wales Rural Fire Service map</a>. The original map is easier to use if you know the names of the fire locations, but the Google map has a few more overlays that can be helpful.</p>
