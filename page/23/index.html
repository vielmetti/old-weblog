<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>I'm listening to the <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/3465">Tuolumne County Sheriff, Fire, and Police scanner feed</a> via Broadcastify. The scanner chatter includes the usual traffic reports but also the distinctive cadence of firefighting operations - calls for "Charlies" (?), water tenders, and other fire equipment, and a fire coordinator asking a crew leader what additional resources they need.</p>

<p>This webcam photo from within Yosemite shows the intense smoke that characterizes this fire.</p>

<p>Much more information about the Rim Fire, including maps, is available through <a href="http://inciweb.org/incident/3660/">InciWeb</a> system. The August 25 update reads as follows:</p>

<p>&gt; The Rim Fire continues to burn on the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park, Bureau of Land Management and State responsibility land. The fire is exhibiting continued growth to the northeast and east. On the western side of the fire, crews successfully conducted firing operations to bring the fire line down to the Tuolumne River in efforts to keep the fire from spreading to the west toward the Highway 108 corridor. Aerial resources continue to be effective in reducing the spread of fire toward the Highway 108 corridor. Crews continue to construct line construction where accessibility and safety allows. In addition, structure defense and contingency planning continues in the Mather area.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 23, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18169">declared a state of emergency</a> for San Francisco, noting that the fire threatens both power and water resources for the city.</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the wildfires that started in Tuolumne County have caused damage to electrical infrastructure serving the City and County of San Francisco, and now threaten damage to property, equipment, and resources of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department; and</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been forced to shut down transmission lines with the result that the City and County is affected by the wildfires in the County of Tuolumne and is likely to be further affected should the fire cause additional damage to the City and County of San Francisco’s water and electrical assets in Tuolumne County, including the possible temporary interruption of electricity and/or water delivery;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.</p>

<p>Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.</p>

<p>It's worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time. Fortunately both boys are self-propelled on bicycles to get to school.</p>

<p>Apples are back in season, after a full year last year without them. The reports from market suggest that the crop is going to be a good one.</p>

<p>Football parking is back on the agenda - football itself, not so much, but the crowds that come with games can mean a juicy allowance for the intrepid soul who has a front yard and a driveway with extra spaces for cars.</p>

<p>There's a tally of the things that didn't get done this summer. Strawberry picking didn't happen (papa had a bad morning), and blueberry picking didn't work out that well (the youngest couldn't reach the high bush berries). I'm hoping that our Ypsilanti raspberry patch will be free from the fly infestation (spotted wing Drosophila) that has wiped out several other berrypicking locations nearby.</p>

<p>Farmers Market is always worth going to this time of year. Late summer suppers with green beans, tomatoes, and corn are a joy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two reports of a fire on the 900 block of Mary Street on Saturday at around 3:00 a.m. The sirens woke me up.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/garage-fire-on-mary-street-threatens-nearby-homes/">AnnArbor.com story</a> notes that a 3 car garage was destroyed and gives the "we don't know very much" report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://michigandaily.com/blog/wire/police-investigating-fire-mary-street">Michigan Daily story</a> gives more details, including a photo from neighbor Raymond Brokowski, and has this disturbing detail: it's being investigated as arson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals were seen running from the scene. The <a href="http://police.umich.edu/?posting_id=299">crime alert</a> describes them as 5’11” to 6’0”, wearing dark hooded sweatshirts and blue jeans. No further description is given.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE Monday: The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/crime/2-men-suspected-of-lighting-fire-that-destroyed-ann-arbor-garage/">followup AnnArbor.com story</a> has more details, at least a little; it took them a full two and a half days from the time that the incident occurred until they ran the followup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ann Arbor police Lt. Renee Bush said police and fire personnel were sent at 3:20 a.m. Saturday to an alley behind the 600 block of Packard Street for a report of a fire. Bush said the resident of a home in the 900 block of Mary Street, who reported the incident, saw a fire in a recycling container full of cardboard.</p>

<p>Prime Red is also known as Akane or Tokyo Rose. From <a href="http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/akane">Orange Pippin</a>, an encyclopedia of apples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Akane was developed in Japan in the 1930s, and represents an unusual marriage of the classic English early variety, Worcester Pearmain, and the high quality American heritage apple variety, Jonathan - and it is a marriage that works very successfully.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It wasn't completely internet-free, because there was wifi at my Mom's place and wifi at McDonald's for the occasional stops and wifi at the very nice Dead River Cafe in Marquette. But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn't have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places I would have liked to have captured in the moment while I was there with a camera and with Twitter to share them. For example, there's the cutest little gazebo-like structure on the Iron Ore Heritage Trail underneath the LS&amp;I railroad trestle. It's cute until you realize that it's there to deflect the ore pellets off the trail and off of the heads of passing bicyclists as they go under an active set of tracks.</p>

<p>I also missed there being a local wiki to look things up in (and to add my own commentary to) for the Upper Peninsula, along the lines of Ann Arbor's Arborwiki. There's a lot of history in the area that's still relatively unwritten, and it would have been fantastic to have a place to store bits of commentary and observations without necessarily broadcasting a stream of social media to my long-suffering friends.</p>

<p>I'm back, not having missed Facebook much at all, and not having been tethered to a Twitter update stream, and only 100 messages behind in my inbox.</p>

      <p>I'm still reading the darned thing, and sometimes I click on the links. But for now, at least, I'm taking a vow of silence on Facebook. No poking people, no one-click birthday wishes, and no back-and-forth banter punctuated by screen refreshes hoping that there's something else of interest to look at.</p>

<p>I like you all out there in Facebook land, but something has to give, and I'd rather be an old-school blogger that still puts out a post or two a week than an ace Facebook user with little to show for it after years of work except calluses on my fingers.</p>

<p>Ironically you will read this on Facebook, some of you at least, because I haven't yet figured out how or whether to disconnnect the automated Typepad-to-Facebook posting.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On August 15 2013, Cisco announced that it would be laying off 5% of its workforce, or about 4000 employees. Some details:</p>

</ul>

<p>"Because we need to continue to accelerate how we capture growth opportunities, we are taking a series of actions such as reducing management layers, prioritizing R&amp;D investments and a workforce reduction affecting about 4,000 employees, or 5 percent of our workforce."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23862152/cisco-systems-reports-increased-sales-and-profit">Mercury News</a> has a history of Cisco layoffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 4,000 job cuts that Cisco Systems announced Wednesday are the latest in several major staff reductions by the San Jose networking company. Others include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>July 2012: 1,300 jobs, about 2 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>July 2011: 6,500 jobs, 4,400 through layoffs and 2,100 through early retirement packages, representing 9 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>February 2009: 2,000 jobs out of a workforce of 66,560</li>
  <li>April 2001: 8,500 jobs, including 6,000 full-time employees and 2,500 contractors</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Ten years ago, the power went out.</p>

<p>It's not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it's just you or if it's happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called <a href="http://forkestra.com/">Dave Langhorst</a>, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/power_outage.html">2003 blackout</a> here on Vacuum, and the day after, I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/network_down_re.html">asked if people had good fiction</a> to share about end-of-the-world scenarios that involved not fire or ice but network downtime. E. M. Forster's <a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a> was the universal recommendation; I recommend it to you as well as a short story from more than 100 years ago about the death of the net as we know it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a feeling that I'm going to be doing a lot more writing using the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown
is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/using_markdown.html">supported by Typepad</a>, <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">supported by Octopress</a> (with a bunch of enhancements), <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">supported by Github</a> (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), <a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">supported by Vim</a> (with colorizing of text),
and <a href="https://leanpub.com/help/manual">supported by Leanpub</a> (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files). That's five
for five for the environments I'm working in the most, which suggests that it's
worthwhile to learn all that I can.</p>

<p>Markdown is a fairly simple language, and it's relatively old in net terms (2004)
so it's had time to mature. Maturing means both that there are well-documented
core features that are invariant among all Markdown interpreters, as well as 
sometimes incompatible details that show up when people extend the system.</p>

<p>Some popular interpreters include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/">Discount</a>, in C</li>
<li><a href="http://dafoster.net/projects/rdiscount/">RDiscount</a>, in Ruby as a wrapper to Discount</li>
<li><a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">kramdown</a>, written in Ruby</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Setting up <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has given me a chance to look through some of
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti">my old Github repositories</a> and re-assess what's there and how to 
improve on them. </p>

<p>This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it
reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a
github account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/aadl-amazon-linky">aadl-amazon-linky</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">superpatron</a>. Both of these are interfaces
to the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> catalog, which has a very accessible
programming interface with things like RSS feeds for catalog searches.
I'd like to go back and revisit two parts of this. One was a Greasemonkey
plugin to put library results in Amazon; that should be a Chrome plugin.
The second was a "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/79567788/">wall of books</a>" report displaying an RSS query as a
page full of book cover images. Of the two, the second looks easiest to
recreate; I just checked in some new code, <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/superpatron/blob/master/tools/wall-by-keyword.sh">wall by keyword</a>, which does
the trick.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools">vielmetti-shelltools</a>. This is a small collection of shell scripts
that I carry around with me and put on whatever system I happen to be
working on. It would be worthwhile to go back through and compare
what I used then with what I use now and refresh the collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">postcard</a>. This was a hopeful project to use various web-to-postcard
APIs to generate custom postcards on the fly from the command line. Alas,
several of those APIs have disappeared. The real action in this market is
sending a real postcard from your iPhone or Android phone, with products
like <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a> leading the way. The other neat feature is to go to a drugstore
and make an instant print, then stick a stamp on the back and mail it.
(<a href="http://communitynetworking2008.wordpress.com/">Steve Cisler</a> taught me that trick.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter-mutual-friends</a>. Once upon a time, the Twitter API was so
simple that you could write a useful application in four lines of shell
script. Now the API has improved itself, and it's gotten a lot more 
complicated. Look at simple apps like <a href="https://github.com/gianu/latest_tweets">latest_tweets</a> by gianu to
get an idea of what you're up against now.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">mobile</a>. Again, once upon a time, I had a Blackberry phone which
had the world's worst usable web browser. Fortunately there were enough
web sites that had a minimalist presentation that I was able to put
together a directory of workable sites, which I used for quite a while.
Now I have an Android phone that runs Chrome as well as apps and I don't
need the list of sites quite so much; still, it's worthwhile to have
a place to collect them when I find them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So when it's time to write some code here are some ideas for where
to start again!</p>

      <p>I am using Octopress to build a new web site at <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io">http://vielmetti.github.io</a>. This looks like it will be a good place as any to write about code and any github projects I am working on. I will keep writing about everything else here.</p>

<p>To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown. Then you use a command line tool called 'rake', the Ruby version of 'make', to do the publishing. Files that have changed get checked in to github. Then the whole site is put into static files, so that it all loads fast.</p>

<p>Amazing how much more time you have for hacking when you are not on Facebook.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Several reasons why I am removing the Facebook from my phone.</p>

<p>Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</p>

<p>Facebook's ads are increasingly intrusive. It is easier to cope with the ads on Twitter.</p>

<p>It is easy to switch identity on the Twitter client so if I temporarily need to take the voice of Arborwiki or of Heikki Lunta it is easy. With Facebook I am expected to be me all the time.</p>

<p>The mobile Android Facebook client is bad at reminders of birthdays, so to do that I need to go to the desktop client anyways.</p>

<p>Time on Facebook generally is time away from blogging. True, the blog has fewer readers and less comments then an equal post on Facebook, but I am not writing this strictly to chase feedback.</p>

<p>It is always worthwhile to experiment with change, especially since it would be easy to change back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997">from the Ann Arbor District Library.</a></p>

<p>Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</p>

<p>Grant likes givers, but recognizes that sometimes people give too much and never manage to get things in return. These selfless people tend to burn out when too many things go opposite to their interests. He opens up the opportunity to recognize a newly coined word "otherish" - an opposite of selfish where you consider both your interests and the others interests simultaneously. "Otherish" people are looking for win-win situations, as opposed to selfless people who end up in win-lose setups.</p>

<p>"Givers are overrepresented at the top, as well as at the bottom, of most success measures." </p>

<p>An <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/printer_friendly.cfm?articleid=3224">interview with Adam Grant</a> about the book is a 25 minute version which touches on several more high points of the book.</p>

      <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small.

<p>The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. That candidate who will go unnamed was said to have been very upset about losing, and their supporters were said to have been rude to the press and to other politicos present. I wasn't there to witness it myself.</p>

Here&#39;s a few notes. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/ann-arbor-planning-commission-denies-rezoning-for-duplex-on-packard/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story about the meeting</a> and a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/08/07/rezoning-request-denied-for-3325-packard/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes. By a unanimous vote, the Planning Commission turned down the request, stating in the discussion both that the master plan envisioned single-family homes in that area and that they were not in the habit of doing &quot;spot zoning&quot; to change a single parcel. The petitioner was encouraged to consult with neighbors to see if an entire block front could be upzoned which would be more likely - though by no means guaranteed - to get approval.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of public commentary on this public hearing came from a neighbor, who did not express an opinion about the zoning request but did request that the property owners trim their trees, which are extending over to her roof.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that has duplexes, and I have to say that they are perfectly in character in a mix of housing that includes single-family houses next door. Indeed, I can&#39;t imagine a neighborhood situation where a duplex would be out of character anywhere in Ann Arbor, especially given modern duplex designs that look like single-family homes. It&#39;s not atypical that on my block a neighbor lives in a home that was built as a single family home, was duplexed in the 1940s, and was unduplexed when she bought it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not sure that the master planning for the area in question makes any sense. Packard is an extraordinary busy street near Platt, and five lanes of traffic means that any single family home is going to be particularly attractive to a buyer. The part of Packard that I leave near is upzoned along quite a length, allowing for a mix of rental properties, small apartment buildings, offices and retail. It&#39;s a good mix, and makes for a more interesting place to live. I&#39;d think that even if the area in question stayed residential that it would be sensible to allow more density along Packard - not necessarily a 13 story high rise, but other dense residential or small-scale commerical or office property that characterizes the rest of the Packard corridor.</p>
<p>The zoning map below shows the parcel - it&#39;s one of the ten residential lots on the north size of Packard, with commerical and apartment buildings across the street and offices and retail on the same side to the west.</p>

The survey,&#0160;<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG</a>, is brief and should take about 10 minutes to fill out. Everyone is invited to take this survey, dog owners and non owners, alike. Input on the survey is very important to PAC and will help create recommendations that improve overall parks and recreation service to the residents of Ann Arbor. The survey remains open through Monday, Aug. 12, 2013.<br /><br />The desire for additional dog parks is identified in the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Open Space Plan (an element of the City Master Plan). In an effort to ensure PAC is responding to this need in an appropriate manner, the public is being asked for input on where one or more dog parks could be located and what types of amenities should be considered for inclusion in new and existing dog parks.<br /><br />While there is not a single standard for dog park development, the subcommittee has been working to identify best practices from around the country to develop elements and criteria that we believe will lead to successful dog parks in Ann Arbor. Some of these elements/criteria include location, size, and the features on site. However, the committee knows there may be others, so a key objective of this survey is to understand what additional criteria the public believes is important to successful dog parks.<br /><br />The Dog Park Subcommittee will also host two public meetings — Tuesday, Aug. 27 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in the basement conference room of Larcom City Hall (301 E. Huron Street), and Wednesday, Sept. 11 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Cobblestone Farm Barn (2781 Packard Road) — to share the survey results and further engage the community on this important topic. You can also email your input to: a2parks@a2gov.org.

      <p>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million.

<p>Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print. Everyone will be watching the Post&#39;s digital operations to see how it changes over time to incorporate the things that Bezos learned from tipping the book world upside down with the Kindle.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><strong><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_self">TOR</a></strong> is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &quot;onion routers&quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &quot;dark&quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet. A 2005 era web site <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/" target="_self">describes the theory</a> behind onion routing.</p>
<p>The TOR network operators have encouraged a broad spectrum of users to participate in the system, and it has become favored of several unsavory business enterprises that take advantage of the anonymity provided to transact business that would be shut down on the public Internet. (Or so it is alleged; I haven&#39;t seen that first hand).</p>
<p>In early August, 2013, the TOR network was compromised. A popular browser for the system, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_self">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, was attacked with a Javascript exploit that causes the nominally anonymous system to report its real IP address and MAC address to a central server, thus decloaking the device. The allegations are flying around as to who did this attack, but it&#39;s been alleged that a government is behind it because there are no indications that the exploit inserts any malware - just this deanonymizing task.</p>

      <p>&quot;Make the pile smaller&quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Making the pile smaller is also a good way of dealing with a rotten smell in compost piles due to anaerobic conditions, <a href="http://umaine.edu/publications/1159e/" target="_self">says</a> the U of Maine extension.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The question from <a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/589393/FOIA-at-core-of-court-case.html?nav=5006" target="_self">a story in the Marquette Mining Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>The association is important to plaintiffs in the case because it was created under state law requirements by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which makes it a public body by extension, the plaintiffs contend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The association in question is the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3311_4111_18442-168830--,00.html" target="_self">Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Assocation</a>, described on a Michigan DEQ site as follows.</p>
<blockquote>The Geological Core and Sample Repository holds a <br />collection of drill core and cuttings from 67 counties <br />in Michigan, including all 15 counties from the Upper <br />Peninsula. The purpose of the collection is to act as <br />a &quot;rock library&quot; and make the collected material <br />available to individual researchers and industry for <br />geologic study. It is hoped that the collection will <br />lead to increased mineral and fuel exploration and <br />development in various parts of Michigan. Both the <br />local and state economies may benefit by more jobs <br />being created.</blockquote>
<p>The plaintiffs contend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The murky facts surrounding the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association exemplify the need for the Freedom of Information Act and the purpose for which it was enacted: to shine a light on the actions of government officials which directly impact the citizens whom they purport to represent,&quot; said Jana Mathieu, the plaintiff&#39;s attorney.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Near the Upper Peninsula District Office of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in Gwinn, this map taped to the wall of a large warehouse labels the facility a “State Warehouse.” Core samples are stored within, but the DEQ claims no further association with NMGRA, the non-profit that has leased the warehouse and is attempting to raise money to make it a state geologic repository.</strong></p>
