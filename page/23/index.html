To the clerk:
The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to spend money to replace them.
To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at council about the state of the lighting, I'd like to make this request. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-23-foia-inspection-reports-for-downtown-ann-arbor-street-lights/">&raquo;</a></p>

The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site.
