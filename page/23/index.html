      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.camera-wiki.org" target="_self">Camera-wiki.org</a> is a successful, non-commercial fork of Camerapedia. It was built over the span of about a month, with a small team of volunteers reconstructing the wiki and its image database in response to a sale of Camerapedia to Wikia. <a href="http://www.steevithak.com/2011/02/27/goodbye-camerapedia-hello-camera-wiki-org/" target="_self">Steevithiak tells the tale from the inside</a>, of late-night perl scripts crawling through the databases reconstructing the site and of coordinated action to rebuild the photo pool.</p>
<p>The challenge of running a wiki is not only that you have to maintain a large collection of encyclopedic content, but also that you have to keep a pile of funky software running. The enticing trade is to accept advertising on your wiki pages in exchange for &quot;free&quot; hosting. The hosting company gets your community&#39;s sweat equity, unless they <a href="http://blog.camera-wiki.org/2011/02/07/hello-world/" target="_self">rebel en masse</a> and go and build their own sandbox. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/camerapedia/discuss/72157625827923382/" target="_self">More power to them</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The world of Twitter has an infinite demand for your 140 character episodes, but it&#39;s not a satisfying place to compose something that has depth or nuance to it. My daily column of 500 words on AnnArbor.com takes an hour or more to write, and I never have the sense that I can dash it off casually.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best approach is to aim for a happy medium. What if the unit of composition is 140 words, not 140 characters? That is three compact paragraphs, with enough space to advance a thought without dragging on forever.&#0160;</p>
<p>This mini essay is exactly 140 words. It&#39;s concise but not telegraphic, and in writing it I removed as many words as I typed in order to fit it into this small space. The form imposes constraints, but it also leaves enough room to utter more than chatty quips.</p>

      <p>An old bicycle wheel makes a good pulley wheel.</p>
<p>An old modem, of any sort, can be repurposed by attaching a single RJ-11 cord to both ends of it; you now have a loop, and the RJ-11 threads through the bicycle wheel.</p>

<pre>I must have been in the cycle early for McDonald's 
fast-food intelligent man-machine systems, according to 
Guthery's law:
   &gt;     In an evolving man-machine system, the man will get
   &gt;     dumber faster than the machine gets smarter.

McDonald's fast food computers (i.e., cash registers) 
collect all sorts of data on the individual employee at 
the counter and on all counter sales as a whole.  They also 
do not have a &lt;no sale&gt; key that opens up the cash
register, probably to prevent theft.  That made it real hard to fix a
mistake without calling a manager to get a key to open the drawer.

Solution?  Well, the people I worked with at McD's had been 
around thesystem long enough to figure out how to get around 
it.  Without getting into too many details of why things were 
as they were, the easiest way to open the drawer without a 
manager was to ring up a sale that gave away a 
tub of barbecue sauce for McNuggets and nothing else.  
   (Hit &lt;promo&gt; &lt;barbecue&gt; &lt;promo&gt; &lt;total&gt; .)
Of course, that messed up the daily statistics some.

      </h3>
      <p>You are given a day to produce something of interest. How much of that time should be spend reading, and how much time should be spent writing?</p>
<p>There is a good argument to be made that you want to minimize your research budget and maximize the number of words produced. It&#39;s hard to be a productive writer when the time is spent in the inbox deleting mail or on the net looking aimlessly for something of interest, for neither mode lends itself to long stretches of concentrated thought. Rather, you start work by working, and do the research as you need to extend the story.</p>
<p>If you are going to spent time reading before you start typing, the sensible thing would be to open up the page and begin to write first, and only then let the triggers in your text lead you to temporary search distractions. If you can corral your enthusiasm for wandering around the net enough that you can be focused more on what is in your own head and less on what is trying to catch your attention, it will be easier to produce something useful.</p>
<p>There is a type of writing that I find myself doing perhaps too frequently where every sentence has a link to something. I am not sure how this can be anything but slow to put together, since there&#39;s a substantial and ongoing risk of distraction that you are participating in as well as inviting your reader to participate in.</p>
<p>The simplistic perspective is simply to say that hyperlinks subvert storytelling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The relatively peaceful strike took a violent turn on July 27th (1934) when special deputies broke through the picket lines to escort a coal car that strikers had turned back. A battle ensued outside the plant that left two strikers dead and over 40 wounded. The next day, Governor Schmedeman called out the National Guard to restore order.</p>

<p>That’s why, when I was in the throngs of rank-and-file workers, I was hearing “tax the rich.” People were comparing Scott Walker to the U.S.-backed Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was forced to resign last week after 18 days of protest. They are calling him “Hosni Walker” because only dictators side with the tiny minority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The quake, or cryoseism as it’s known in scientific circles, occurs when moisture soaks into the soil and a quick freeze causes a sudden, even violent expansion and contraction.

Special attention is paid to the East European Platform; using the data for this platform, with thorough consideration of reference quakes along with the weather conditions, the signs of a specific class of nontectonic seismic events are determined. The question concerning the necessity of the frost quakes’ discrimination in compilation of tectonic earthquake catalogues in certain regions is stated.</blockquote>

<p>At 22:34 UTC (00:34am local time), Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet&#39;s global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt&#39;s service providers. Virtually all of Egypt&#39;s Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide.</p>

<blockquote>You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory.</blockquote>
<p>What is a grue?</p>
<blockquote>The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2183381">More on "Grue" and Grue</a>, The Philosophical Review © 1961 Duke University Press.  
<blockquote>Mr. Grue believes that grass is grue, taken here to mean that it is green until the year 2000 and blue afterward.</blockquote>
Grue is the color of the y2k problem - green (providing riches) until the year 2000, and blue (providing sadness) afterwards.  Noted here, as <a href="http://www.commercialventvac.com/y2k.html">The Year 2000 Crisis: One software engineers' perspective"</a>:
<blockquote>
This is not a new problem.  There is a paradox, called "Goodman's Grue-Bleen paradox", which describes what we're facing.  See The fall 1983 issue of the Bulletin of the Santayana Society, "on Grue and Bleen", by  Angus Kerr-Lawson.  See also Goodman's Paradox.  In the paradox, an object is "grue" if it is green between a certain time, T, and blue after T.  An object is "bleen" if it is blue before T, and green after T.  The paradox is how to tell the difference between something which is green and something which is grue.  At the moment, it is impossible to know.  After T, it will be easy.  Similarly, it is easy to tell the difference between something which is green and something which is bleen.  But after T, it might not be.  Further, any system built on distingushing between green and blue will work properly now with green, blue, and bleen objects, but will fail after time T. 
</blockquote>
Is there a relationship between the "grue" of Zork and the "grue" of the color paradox?

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-18-task-sandwich-activity-tracker-in-google-spreadsheet/">daily aliquot of love</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A very brief writeup of a technique for doing online task management, in a world where there are so many social media channels that you need a spreadsheet to keep track of them all.</p>
<p>The software is Google Spreadsheet, used with a private sheet all for myself.</p>
<p>The structure of the worksheet is a set of columns, with column headings indicating the piece of software, online system, or media channel that you are tracking; the rows are dated or time stamped.</p>
<p>Each cell has a brief summary of events, activities, or other goings-on for that channel at that time. &quot;Birthday deals&quot; is my notation from Facebook for Jan 5, 2011, noting that on that day I wished people a happy birthday by sending them the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Arborwiki birthday deals page</a> (my customary greeting card). Keep it short, down to a name, a keyword, a tag, or anything else minimal.</p>
<p>The key technique is hyperlinking each of these (column header and activity cell) where possible, so that you can go back and re-animate your activity on a minimum notice. The syntax is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=hyperlink(URL,&quot;text&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is simple enough to make it not be a big deal to do.</p>
<p>The locus of activity moves. Rather than opening a new window, looking for page changes to the more frequent sites that you visit, and hoping mindlessly that there&#39;s something new, the unit of online activity becomes working your way across the columns and methodically filling in each of them with a daily aliquot of love.</p>
<p>The challenge is getting the column headers right, so that you focus on the correct systems, and ignore the irrelevant ones.</p>
<p>Why do I call it task sandwich? Darned if I know, that&#39;s what got typed in.</p>

Digital photography was new then, and special, and there was some first flush of enthusiasm for having a system that &quot;got it&quot;.</p>
<p>Time and space happened, and Flickr became part of Yahoo. A piece of the fun drained out, and the Internet got bigger.

<p>I&#39;m at a point where I could easily take a photograph every day and send it somewhere. Should Flickr be that place? Will the time come not too soon when I will want to be a refugee from it, downloading my photos in the hopes that I can re-upload them somewhere else, tags and annotations intact and some fragment of society reconstructed around them?</p>
<p>I loved Flickr once, in the way that I&#39;m sure that people once loved Compuserve. There is still a Game Neverending to play with photographs, but I don&#39;t know yet where to play that game.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>For future reference, since I end up immediately thinking of Veblen when I read about <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/scharffenberger-tofu.html" target="_self">artisanal tofu</a>. This from Theory of the Leisure Class is on hand-made goods (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place assigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point of material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought goods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former serve their primary purpose more adequately. They are a more perfect product—show a more perfect adaptation of means to end. This does not save them from disesteem and deprecation, for they fall short under the test of honorific waste. <em>Hand labor is a more wasteful method of production; hence the goods turned out by this method are more serviceable for the purpose of pecuniary reputability; hence the marks of hand labor come to be honorific, and the goods which exhibit these marks take rank as of higher grade than the corresponding machine product. </em>Commonly, if not invariably, the honorific marks of hand labor are certain imperfections and irregularities in the lines of the hand-wrought article, showing where the workman has fallen short in the execution of the design. The ground of the superiority of hand-wrought goods, therefore, is a certain margin of crudeness. This margin must never be so wide as to show bungling workmanship, since that would be evidence of low cost, nor so narrow as to suggest the ideal precision attained only by the machine, for that would be evidence of low cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/833/833-h/833-h.htm" target="_self">Gutenberg edition of Theory of the Leisure Class</a>&#0160;is a convenient edition, since it&#39;s all on one page; it also has those honorific marks of hand labor, including exhortations at the end to give the reader &quot;Plain Vanilla ASCII&quot; upon request.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, of course, the details of the relationship between man and machine also change. Goods produced on an old machine, ideally one for which parts cannot be obtained except by manufacturing them yourself, obtain the high status of handmade goods. The more obscure the equipment, the better, and imperfections in old equipment provide the same &quot;honorific marks&quot; of handmade goods.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup.</p>
<p>The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere.</p>
<p>The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food.</p>
<p>What I was really after, and what I found readily (since 34 people have bookmarked it on pinboard) was Malcolm Gladwell's 2004 <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_09_06_a_ketchup.html" target="_self">The Ketchup Conundrum</a>. After finding that, I readily found Meg Favreau's <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article07290902.aspx" target="_self">Playing Ketchup</a>&nbsp;and Johan Lehrer's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/08/ketchup.php" target="_self">Ketchup</a> from The Frontal Cortex.</p>
<p>As for recipes (other than "buy a bottle of Heinz"), try</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jamie-oliver/homemade-tomato-ketchup-recipe/index.html" target="_self">Jamie Oliver's homemade ketchup</a></li>
<li>(your suggestion goes here)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my search strategies in finding things that I had previously known about is to search for them with my name attached, e.g. a search for "vielmetti ketchup". This is less about ego and more about retrieval; you can do the same with your favorite prolific blogger or news source ("kottke ketchup" generates an equally interesting set).</p>
<p>I wonder if you've been getting enough ketchup.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/" target="_self">scuttlebutt</a> is that delicious is going to be <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bpm140/status/15473591558602752" target="_self">axed</a> by Yahoo.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.</p>
<p>Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it. Sometimes these were straightforward tags, like the 1533 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/annarbor" target="_self">annarbor</a>&quot;. Others were idiosyncratic, like the 5 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/attention-to-irrelevant-details" target="_self">attention-to-irrelevant-details</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>There are other, better ways to bookmark things so that lots of people see them. The facebook &quot;like&quot; button gets more page views without consuming any <a href="http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0098.html" target="_self">cognitive overhead</a> about how to tag, whether to tag, and what you&#39;ve tagged before. Actually writing about something is quite a bit better than just bookmarking it, because you get to be yourself for a little while and not just an automaton forwarding on links automatically.</p>
<p>Every bookmark I ever did on delicious, up until now, is archived for posterity here:&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm" target="_self">vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm</a>&#0160;. As I review it, there really should have been more of them marked &quot;attention to irrelevant details&quot;. It&#39;s hours of reading, though some of it goes by fast because the site that was linked to has disappeared, leaving only the bookmark and whatever clipping I managed to care about.</p>
<p>edit: now with more cognitive overhead</p>
<p>more delicious:</p>

      <p>I'm sure there's a cheaper way to clean a dishwasher than to put heavily marketed, sugary "breakfast drink" powder into it. Tang is citric acid and sweetener and artificial flavor that tastes like moon rocks.</p>
<p>The dishwasher is cleaner, though, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Other suggestions for cleaners include vinegar, straight citric acid, borax, and baking soda. None of those have the astronaut cachet.</p>

      <p>&quot;When you retire,&quot; he says, &quot;you should go offline for a whole year.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea is to sell all of your computers, turn in your cell phone, and generally shun any computer technology. Perhaps you&#39;ll still write, but it will be longhand or on a typewriter. If there&#39;s a phone call to be made, you&#39;ll have to be there to receive it, since there is no answering machine. No Twitter, no Facebook, no blogs. Whatever money you save in computing and telecom costs, you spend on pens and paper and postcards and stamps.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not certain what this word &quot;retire&quot; means, but it&#39;s an appealing idea. For me, it would mean rewinding the technology clock back to the early 1980s.</p>

      </h3>
      <blockquote>
<p>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece. (This article will be no exception.) But the academic buzz around the subject isn’t just a case of eggheads rationalizing their slothfulness. As various scholars argue in “The Thief of Time,” edited by Chrisoula Andreou and Mark D. White (Oxford; $65)—a collection of essays on procrastination, ranging from the resolutely theoretical to the surprisingly practical—the tendency raises fundamental philosophical and psychological issues.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am reading this while procrastinating.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/03/time_management.html" target="_self">precise instructions to myself</a> in my journal in 1999, repeated in 2004, on how to avoid procrastination, under the guise of &quot;time management&quot;. This presumes, of course, that all you need to do is make a few rational decisions and buck up and buckle down to work, in the ignorance of all other possible motivations.</p>
<p>A challenge in a world of infinite possibilities is that choosing to do anything means you are choosing not to do something else. This brings to mind <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/" target="_self">Jim Benson&#39;s Personal Kanban</a>, which only has two rules at its core:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize your work</li>
<li>Limit your work in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>A sure cure for procrastination, then, is simply to not do something, rather than putting it off. Alas not all tasks can be discarded so easily.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://munnecke.com/blog/" target="_self">Tom Munnecke</a> reminds me of a slow conversation we have been having for a few years. &#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/slow_conversati.html" target="_self">I noted it here about five years ago.</a>&#0160;&#0160;Five years is a pretty good time to stretch out a single line of thinking, so it&#39;s worthwhile reflecting on how much current writing structure allows for some amount of leisurely conversation in the face of a daily deadline.</p>
<p>The hard part about taking a question slowly is that <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti" target="_self">most of what I end up writing for AnnArbor.com</a> is done with a short deadline. A daily column gets written the same day, much of the time, and the hours spent reading and following up on comments are as near real time performance art as anything else. How on earth do you have leisurely conversations when there&#39;s always the next thing to do?</p>
<p>The answer, perhaps, is to leave open questions which are unanswered, and don&#39;t try to seal off the end of each piece of writing with a neat and tidy finish. By leaving open ended questions which would take much more time than could be answered inside the scope of the words you have to produce today, you get the hopeful opportunity to revisit that same topic knowing a bit more about what you don&#39;t know when it&#39;s time to look again.</p>
<p>This echoes, in part, one of <a href="http://dangillmor.com/" target="_self">Dan Gillmor</a>&#39;s suggestions for journalism: that readers and writers <a href="http://personaldemocracy.com/blog-entry/using-distributed-media-and-people-ask-hard-questions" target="_self">collect unanswered questions</a> as a part of the process of addressing complicated issues, and that the collected set of questions gets raised not only by the author but also by anyone else who wants to take up the task.</p>
<p>Writing a good question is difficult, and knowing when and where to pose it is a challenge. Some questions are better spoken, and others better written down. If the questions are difficult enough, you might spend most of the time looking to see who will answer them sensibly. &#0160;Yet it may be that only by raising more questions than you are able to answer that you will get forward progress on complicated issues at a pace that doesn&#39;t lend itself to instant answers.</p>

<blockquote>In an exploration of fictional tools for hibernators, Susanna Hertrich developed the Chrono_shredder, a product that serves as a reminder to live one&#39;s life productively. The 365-day calendar is dispensed day-by-day from a single roll, each day shredded over an exact 24-hour period.</blockquote>
<p>I can imagine creating the counterpart to this work, a calendar which is a fax machine connected to a phone line that faxes in, slowly, line by line, the image of the next day&#39;s calendar page. I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide what bit rate corresponds to one 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; calendar page per day.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain that there is a market for stock-photography style professional photography; you want to make it look like the photographer is capturing the universal image, but hey - it&#39;s you!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s harvest time, which means there are a lot of recipes you can do with food that you can buy locally. One thing that would help that a lot is finding the people who buy the same stuff you do, and who share the same tastes, and who can work with you to figure out how to stock up so you have enough on your shelves always to get a meal on the table.</p>
<p>The approach that seems best is to come up with a harvest calendar for each kind of produce that you enjoy, and then to use it as a set of filters into which you set in a bunch of recipes.</p>
<p>The end result could be as simple as tuning in to the local markets, figuring out what is exceptionally good quality or good value at the moment, and then getting back a list of recipes that takes advantage of that. For the handful of things that only show up once a year for a short season (quince, paw paws) you want to anticipate that with recipes so that when they do show you are ready to go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Also known as &quot;retcon&quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &#0160;As pulled from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity" target="_self">notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon</a> (at least today):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Retroactive continuity&quot; was shortened to &quot;retcon&quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USENET" title="USENET">USENET</a>. Hard evidence of Cugley&#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &quot;The originator of the word &#39;retcon&#39;.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;Cugley used the newly-shortened word to describe a development in the comic book&#0160;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_of_the_Swamp_Thing" title="Saga of the Swamp Thing">Saga of the Swamp Thing</a></em>, which reinterprets the events of the title character&#39;s origin by revealing facts that, up to that point, are not part of the narrative and were not intended by earlier writers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia conveniently doesn&#39;t yet include <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics/browse_thread/thread/9d31a64739cb54e3/7e01d8472da63f0?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=retcon" target="_self">this post from rec.arts.comics from Steve Simmons</a>&#0160;in 1989:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear, hear! &#0160;&quot;Crisis On Infinite Earths&quot; solved a DC crisis all right,&#0160;but it wasn&#39;t the problem of having multiple earths. &#0160;It was the problem&#0160;of 50 years of continuity complicating their existing characters. &#0160;DC&#0160;had been either ignoring the continuity (which led to contradiction and&#0160;reader frustration) or attempting to adhere to it, effectively hamstringing&#0160;them (&quot;remember, we solved that one back in &#39;42&quot;). &#0160;&quot;Crisis&quot; let DC have&#0160;good reason to&#0160;<strong>retcon</strong>&#0160;characters to whatever extent needed -- heck, it&#0160;practically demanded it.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implanting false memories can also be useful for the corporate persona, where parts of the corporate origin story get rewritten to suit the current corporate branding. If you don&#39;t have strong documentation for the past - or if no one really cares - you can pull together a selective narrative that picks out the parts of the history that highlight the best parts of the present.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Rankings impose discipline on markets: Wendy&#0160;Espeland&#39;s&#0160;<a href="http://asociologist.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/notes-from-icos-espeland-a-different-kind-of-quantitative-sociology/" target="_self">A Different Kind of Quantitative Sociology</a>&#0160;talk at ICOS in 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third is&#0160;<em>discipline</em>&#0160;(<a href="http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/where-in-the-world-is-michel-foucault/">here comes the Foucault!</a>). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers. Espeland draws here on her recent work on US News and World Report law school rankings. For example, because the rankings counted median LSAT scores of only regular full-time students, law schools began to push weaker applicants into doing part-time and night programs. In response to a proposal by US News to start including those programs in the median LSAT calculations, law schools formed committees to ponder reforming or closing their night and part-time programs. Organizational discipline in action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of the argument has 5 bullet points</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantification takes work</li>
<li>Quantification changes what it measures</li>
<li>Quantification imposes discipline on those who are measured</li>
<li>Numbers are seen as authoritative</li>
<li>Numbers are powerful for their aesthetic qualities</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202444960579&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1" target="_self">National Law Journal takes on the impact</a> of this in May 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>U.S. News</em>&#0160;does maintain a law school &quot;diversity index,&quot; but those data are not a factor in the overall rankings.&#0160;<br /><br />&quot;A lot of people we interviewed expressed concern over the impact of rankings on diversity,&quot; said Wendy Espeland, an assistant professor of sociology at Northwestern University. &quot;The overarching tension between catering to the rankings and doing what you think is best for your school is intense.&quot;&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every once in a while I invoke the phrase &quot;quality without a number&quot;; most recently, I guess, in a post on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/reification-is.html" target="_self">Reification is an Ontological Imperative</a>, also from 2008. <a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2008/04/14/detroit-presentation-the-politics-of-metrics/" target="_self">&#0160;Ed Yourdon&#39;s The Politics of Metrics</a> has the same theme.</p>

<p>Maps are being produced with evacuation zones. Look for one that loads fast, which means that a typical output from a GIS system with every road marked in loving detail is not what you want. &#0160;See e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bit.ly/9Rx8c2" target="_self">800kb map</a> hosted on Google Docs</li>

</ul>
<p>Note to self, it would be worthwhile to GIS managers to have an option for &quot;emergency map&quot; that automatically produces a space-efficient map that can be used in the field.</p>
