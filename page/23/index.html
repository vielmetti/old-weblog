<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

Here&#39;s a few notes. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/ann-arbor-planning-commission-denies-rezoning-for-duplex-on-packard/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story about the meeting</a> and a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/08/07/rezoning-request-denied-for-3325-packard/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes. By a unanimous vote, the Planning Commission turned down the request, stating in the discussion both that the master plan envisioned single-family homes in that area and that they were not in the habit of doing &quot;spot zoning&quot; to change a single parcel. The petitioner was encouraged to consult with neighbors to see if an entire block front could be upzoned which would be more likely - though by no means guaranteed - to get approval.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of public commentary on this public hearing came from a neighbor, who did not express an opinion about the zoning request but did request that the property owners trim their trees, which are extending over to her roof.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that has duplexes, and I have to say that they are perfectly in character in a mix of housing that includes single-family houses next door. Indeed, I can&#39;t imagine a neighborhood situation where a duplex would be out of character anywhere in Ann Arbor, especially given modern duplex designs that look like single-family homes. It&#39;s not atypical that on my block a neighbor lives in a home that was built as a single family home, was duplexed in the 1940s, and was unduplexed when she bought it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not sure that the master planning for the area in question makes any sense. Packard is an extraordinary busy street near Platt, and five lanes of traffic means that any single family home is going to be particularly attractive to a buyer. The part of Packard that I leave near is upzoned along quite a length, allowing for a mix of rental properties, small apartment buildings, offices and retail. It&#39;s a good mix, and makes for a more interesting place to live. I&#39;d think that even if the area in question stayed residential that it would be sensible to allow more density along Packard - not necessarily a 13 story high rise, but other dense residential or small-scale commerical or office property that characterizes the rest of the Packard corridor.</p>
<p>The zoning map below shows the parcel - it&#39;s one of the ten residential lots on the north size of Packard, with commerical and apartment buildings across the street and offices and retail on the same side to the west.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>PRESS RELEASE<br />For Immediate Release&#0160;<br />CONTACT: Karen Levin, Chair, Dog Park Subcommittee of the Park Advisory Commission,&#0160;734.645.8904<br /><br />PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION SEEKS PUBLIC INPUT ON POTENTIAL DOG PARK LOCATIONS<br /><br />ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 29, 2013 — The City’s Dog Park Subcommittee of the Park Advisory Commission (PAC) is inviting the public to participate in an online survey to gather feedback and opinions on potential dog park locations and features. The survey,&#0160;<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG</a>, is brief and should take about 10 minutes to fill out. Everyone is invited to take this survey, dog owners and non owners, alike. Input on the survey is very important to PAC and will help create recommendations that improve overall parks and recreation service to the residents of Ann Arbor. The survey remains open through Monday, Aug. 12, 2013.<br /><br />The desire for additional dog parks is identified in the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Open Space Plan (an element of the City Master Plan). In an effort to ensure PAC is responding to this need in an appropriate manner, the public is being asked for input on where one or more dog parks could be located and what types of amenities should be considered for inclusion in new and existing dog parks.<br /><br />While there is not a single standard for dog park development, the subcommittee has been working to identify best practices from around the country to develop elements and criteria that we believe will lead to successful dog parks in Ann Arbor. Some of these elements/criteria include location, size, and the features on site. However, the committee knows there may be others, so a key objective of this survey is to understand what additional criteria the public believes is important to successful dog parks.<br /><br />The Dog Park Subcommittee will also host two public meetings — Tuesday, Aug. 27 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in the basement conference room of Larcom City Hall (301 E. Huron Street), and Wednesday, Sept. 11 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Cobblestone Farm Barn (2781 Packard Road) — to share the survey results and further engage the community on this important topic. You can also email your input to: a2parks@a2gov.org.

      <p>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most <a href="http://mediagazer.com/#a130805p20" target="_self">complete collection of links</a> about the Bezos transaction.</p>
<p>Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print. Everyone will be watching the Post&#39;s digital operations to see how it changes over time to incorporate the things that Bezos learned from tipping the book world upside down with the Kindle.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><strong><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_self">TOR</a></strong> is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &quot;onion routers&quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &quot;dark&quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet. A 2005 era web site <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/" target="_self">describes the theory</a> behind onion routing.</p>
<p>The TOR network operators have encouraged a broad spectrum of users to participate in the system, and it has become favored of several unsavory business enterprises that take advantage of the anonymity provided to transact business that would be shut down on the public Internet. (Or so it is alleged; I haven&#39;t seen that first hand).</p>
<p>In early August, 2013, the TOR network was compromised. A popular browser for the system, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_self">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, was attacked with a Javascript exploit that causes the nominally anonymous system to report its real IP address and MAC address to a central server, thus decloaking the device. The allegations are flying around as to who did this attack, but it&#39;s been alleged that a government is behind it because there are no indications that the exploit inserts any malware - just this deanonymizing task.</p>

      <p>&quot;Make the pile smaller&quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Making the pile smaller is also a good way of dealing with a rotten smell in compost piles due to anaerobic conditions, <a href="http://umaine.edu/publications/1159e/" target="_self">says</a> the U of Maine extension.</p>

<p>MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>The association is important to plaintiffs in the case because it was created under state law requirements by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which makes it a public body by extension, the plaintiffs contend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The association in question is the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3311_4111_18442-168830--,00.html" target="_self">Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Assocation</a>, described on a Michigan DEQ site as follows.</p>
<blockquote>The Geological Core and Sample Repository holds a <br />collection of drill core and cuttings from 67 counties <br />in Michigan, including all 15 counties from the Upper <br />Peninsula. The purpose of the collection is to act as <br />a &quot;rock library&quot; and make the collected material <br />available to individual researchers and industry for <br />geologic study. It is hoped that the collection will <br />lead to increased mineral and fuel exploration and <br />development in various parts of Michigan. Both the <br />local and state economies may benefit by more jobs <br />being created.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The murky facts surrounding the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association exemplify the need for the Freedom of Information Act and the purpose for which it was enacted: to shine a light on the actions of government officials which directly impact the citizens whom they purport to represent,&quot; said Jana Mathieu, the plaintiff&#39;s attorney.</p>

I knew him from high school in Marquette (from debate and High School Bowl) and hadn't stayed in touch for years, so this was a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-600wi" alt="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" /></a><br />Bottom, from left: Tom Baldini (coach), me (alternate), Greg Peters, Joel White, Kerry Johnson, Mike Coyne, David Goldsmith (host). "Nothing you learn is ever wasted."</p>
<p>The obit as published in NOLA.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cartoonist and writer Greg Peters died Friday morning, Aug. 2, after emergency surgery at Ochsner Medical Center. Mr. Peters, who had suffered from a congenital heart condition throughout his life, was 50 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Marquette, Mich., Peters arrived in Louisiana in 1990 to pursue a doctorate in English literature at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He became best known as the creator of “Suspect Device,” a starkly crafted, blackly funny Louisiana-themed political comic strip that made its debut in 1996, in the Times of Acadiana, and ran in New Orleans’&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/">Gambit Weekly</a>&nbsp;from 1999 to 2010. “Suspect Device” famously pulled no punches: In 1998, editor Harris Meyer resigned from the Times of Acadiana, when the paper’s publisher refused to run one of Mr. Peters’ strips.</p>
<p>“Suspect Device” was recognized with awards from the Press Club of New Orleans and the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, and in 2004 was anthologized in “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r18Or31mODcC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=greg+peters+attitude+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ih78UY3HG8iWqQHx7YFw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greg%20peters%20attitude%202&amp;f=false">Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists</a>.” Mr. Peters’ work was displayed in exhibitions in conjunction with the book at New York City’s Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art.</p>
<p>Greg Peters was “one of the few alternative weekly political cartoonists whose mission is to skewer local and state politicians," anthology editor Ted Rall told Gambit’s Scott Jordan in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/unusual-suspect/Content?oid=1243221">a 2004 profile of Mr. Peters</a>. "One would think that there would be such a cartoonist, or several, in every major city, but there just aren't,” he said.</p>
<p>“Coupled with an over-the-top clip-art style and incredibly distinct cartooning personality, Greg's strip is everything that his readers and editors can hope for."</p>
<p>Mr. Peters’ distinctive style involved the use of stock clip art images, arranged and annotated with wry, extensive text to skewer public figures.</p>
<p>"The clip art thing was always a punk staple," Mr. Peters told Jordan. "Like the cut-out letters and clip art that Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols designer, did using Queen Elizabeth with the safety clip through her cheek picture. They're very much out of the DIY ethos. And the attitude simply of baseline mistrust for authority, and the demand that you be shown, not told."</p>
<p>Greg Peters is survived by his parents, Reg and Kay Peters of Lafayette; his partner, Eileen Loh; his former wife, Saundra Scarce; and his two sons, Wilder, 12, and Magnus, 10. Plans for a memorial service in the New Orleans area are pending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Facebook page says about 50 reporters were let go, or about a third of the news room.</p>

(I also had a beach nearby and a room full of relatives). Here&#39;s some observations from the mobile-only internet.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it&#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass. My online composition is sufficiently slow that I can&#39;t come anywhere near close to keeping up with my thoughts. So long writing is right out. </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t blog during the trip, and I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a bad thing. There were a handful of occasions where I used Twitter, and I took a few photos that are sharable. Again, because it&#39;s so hard to type, it was easy to let the moment go past.</p>
<p>Twitter was too addictive, as a kind of intermittent reinforcement made it possible to repeatedly swipe down the screen, hear a little click, and then hope that the new tweets were interesting enough to make it worthwhile. I followed a few new busy accounts and was treated to inning by inning baseball scores and some random bits of new weather. I&#39;ll have to unfollow most of them now - that is one nice thing about Twitter compared to Facebook in that you can get a temporary enthusiasm and then shed it quickly.</p>
<p>Email was hard - I could keep up with a little bit of it, but it was daunting to try to answer messages that were long. I knew I was going to be back soon so I let it pile up. I&#39;ll have to try a longer experiment with email to see if I could either shift the context of the emails off to voice or direct message or text message so that there wasn&#39;t such a need to follow throug with endless paragraphs.</p>
<p>I could get used to the mobile-only Internet. It was possible to ignore a lot of what landed in my inbox over the span of a vacation, and the few longer or more important messages will be easy enough to answer.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is easy and feeds a lot of people. I don&#39;t tend to measure, so you&#39;ll want to use proportions to your taste.</p>
<ul>
<li>One half head of green cabbage</li>
<li>Four carrots</li>
<li>Cider vinegar</li>
<li>Mayo</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Shred the cabbage using the slicing blade of your food processor. Put the cabbage in a large bowl. Shake some salt on top of the cabbage and mix it in.</p>
<p>Trim the carrots and grate them using the grating blade of your food processor. Add to the cabbage.</p>
<p>The dressing is a mixture of cider vinegar and mayo. Rather than mix them together first and then getting a dish dirty, I simply pour some cider vinegar over the top of the cabbage-carrot mixture, then add some mayo. Mix thoroughly until the cole slaw is lightly coated with the dressing.</p>
<p>Let sit at least an hour before serving. The cabbage and carrots will both lose a little moisture, so you&#39;ll end up with more dressing than you started with.</p>
<p>Paired with pizza and two-buck chuck wine, this recipe will serve twelve.</p>

      <p>It's all over the local news, but it's a national story as well: Detroit has filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy.html?hp&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Detroit Files for Bankruptcy</a>, July 18. "Detroit, the cradle of America’s automobile industry and once the nation’s fourth-most-populous city, has filed for bankruptcy, an official said Thursday afternoon, the largest American city ever to take such a course."</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323993804578614144173709204.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories" target="_self">Detroit Files for Chapter 9 Bankruptcy</a>, July 18. "The Chapter 9 case filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan came after Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager, failed to reach agreements with enough of the bondholders, pension funds and other creditors to restructure Detroit's debt outside of court. The final decision rested with Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who had appointed Mr. Orr as Detroit's overseer in March."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/" target="_self">United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan</a> does not yet have this filing in its "High Profile" cases.</p>

"Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr, who in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4206913614.PDF" target="_blank">June released a plan</a>&nbsp;to restructure the city's debt and obligations that would leave many creditors with much less than they are owed, had warned consistently that if negotiations hit an impasse, he would move quickly to seek bankruptcy protection."</p>
<p>Detroit News, July 18. <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130718/METRO01/307180103/Detroit-files-bankruptcy?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|FRONTPAGE" target="_self">Detroit files for bankruptcy.</a>&nbsp;"A bankruptcy filing would come as an Ingham County judge is preparing Monday to hear arguments from retirees to block any attempt by Snyder to authorize a bankruptcy. A filing would produce an automatic stay of all pending litigation and would cap a month of intense talks between Orr’s team and creditors, which largely have failed to restructure as much as $20 billion in debt and long-term liabilities."</p>

As posted to Facebook:
<blockquote>
I try to keep my posts upbeat and full of bubbles and sparkles, but sometimes, even monsters have rough days.

I had an extremely disappointing first day at the Ann Arbor Art Fair. Almost immediately, State Street Art Fair representatives told me I was not allowed to perform. The police officers that came were extremely nice, and seemed to be siding with me, but they ultimately had to proceed under advisement from their sergeant.

The best way I can put it is that the Art Fair has effectively bought my beloved city of Ann Arbor during these four days, and has complete authority to do as they wish on its public streets and sidewalks. The State Street organization seemed to be concerned with money - since I hadn't paid them for space, they didn't want me there.

Ann Arbor does not require a permit for street performing. I believe that if I am practicing a reasonable code of conduct (which I always do), I have the right to be performing in a public space.

I talked to a few people from the Main Street Association about performing tomorrow, and it seems promising. Thank you all for your continued support, and for sharing this adventure with me. The comments I saw on twitter today were extremely encouraging. It'll take a whole lot more than a rough day to break my spirit. 

Awwwwwwwwwwwoooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!

<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 28, 2013 — On Thursday, June 27, 2013, the Ann Arbor area was deluged with intense rainfall that caused flooding conditions and significantly increased the flow of wastewater to the City of Ann Arbor Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) over a short period of time.&#0160; Plant flows more than tripled within a half hour.&#0160; As a result of this unprecedented increase in plant flow, approximately 10,000 gallons of untreated wastewater was discharged to the Huron River from&#0160;5:20 to 5:30 p.m.&#0160; By comparison, the WWTP fully treated approximately 350,000 gallons of wastewater during the 10-minute period over which this incident occurred.</p>
<p>Fortunately, due to a number of factors, the impact of this incident on human health and the environment is minimal.&#0160; The flow within the Huron River for the 10 minutes over which the discharge occurred was approximately 11,000,000 gallons, consequently the estimated 10,000 gallons of untreated wastewater was diluted by a factor of 1,000.&#0160; Further, mesh filters were already in place over the storm sewer inlets as part of the ongoing major construction project at the plant, which prevented solid material from entering the Huron River.&#0160; There are no communities downstream of the plant that withdraw water from the Huron River for drinking purposes.&#0160; In addition, the fact that the discharges occurred during extreme rain conditions makes it very unlikely that direct human contact would have occurred, particularly with the significant and immediate dilution of the discharge by the relatively high river flow.</p>
<p>&#0160;In accordance with regulatory protocols, the City of Ann Arbor WWTP contacted the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Washtenaw County Health Department to inform them of this unfortunate incident.&#0160; Plant staff is commended for demonstrating clear thinking and fast action under extreme conditions, which prevented this situation from being much worse.&#0160; Additionally, actions to avoid similar circumstances are being evaluated by plant staff.</p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor DDA has launched a new web site, and one of the features of it is <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/transportation/" target="_self">a map with information available in real time </a>about parking availability at various structures.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e4ab396970b-pi"><img alt="Ann-arbor-dda-parking-availability-map" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e4ab396970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e4ab396970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ann-arbor-dda-parking-availability-map" /></a><br />The structures are in a shade of pale blue, and the lots are in pale green; my current location is marked with a bubble. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking for just space available information, there&#39;s a JSON file with that data; you&#39;ll have to unpack it to map structures to their ID numbers. I don&#39;t know how stable the URL for that data will be (<a href="http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json" target="_self">http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json</a>) over time.</p>
<p>As always, if you&#39;re going to be fetching a file as part of an application you are building, and you fetch it repeatedly, please cache the data for a reasonable time and use common sense not to surprise anyone with what you are doing.</p>

      <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;<em>perceived</em>&#0160;as two different cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. It would not be hard (except on Football Saturdays) to unsee the University, and it would not be hard to live a life on campus that never saw the city, especially if you are an undergraduate.</p>

      <p>More often than not, I am hearing about the death of friends or family through Facebook. I suppose this isn&#39;t surprising; after all, I hear about babies born on the same site. Local newspapers are too slow or too local or publish too infrequently to be a source for family news. The Facebook wall makes as good a place as any to share condolences and to make plans for funerals.</p>
