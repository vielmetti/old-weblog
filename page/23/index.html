            <p>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.

There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/">&raquo;</a></p>

As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the Ann Arbor Chronicle preview. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this Ann Arbor News story.

            <p>Because of the election on Tuesday 5 November 2013, the Ann Arbor City Council will be meeting on Thursday 7 November 2013. Here's a preview of sorts of the agenda. Note that the agenda is subject to change up until the very last minute, though in general it stabilizes well before that.
The Ann Arbor Chronicle preview is well worth a read.
The agenda, in order, noting only interesting items. Your idea of what is interesting may differ. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-01-ann-arbor-city-council-preview-for-thursday-7-november-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>
