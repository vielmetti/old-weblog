<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;<em>perceived</em>&#0160;as two different cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. It would not be hard (except on Football Saturdays) to unsee the University, and it would not be hard to live a life on campus that never saw the city, especially if you are an undergraduate.</p>

A shortage of evidence in the case made that a high hurdle, legal experts said.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami Herald: <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/07/13/3499109/george-zimmerman-not-guilty-in.html" target="_self">Not Guilty</a>. “From a legal perspective, the jury believed that George Zimmerman was justified in using deadly force, that he was in danger of great bodily harm or death in the altercation with Trayvon Martin,’’ said David Edelstein, a Miami criminal defense attorney. “They believed he was simply responding with the force necessary to protect himself. They may also have concluded this was a tragic accident.’’</p>

That hasn’t happened. And if the prosecution can’t prove its case, then Zimmerman&#0160;<em>should</em>&#0160;walk. Many will see this as an unsatisfying outcome; many will think it shouldn’t be this easy to kill someone, concoct an uncontradictable excuse, and get away with it. But a legally satisfying verdict cannot always be the same as a morally satisfying verdict. It would be unjust if Zimmerman were convicted based not on the strength of the evidence against him, but rather on the public sentiment against him.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html" target="_self">Full text of Anton Chekov&#39;s &quot;Gooseberries&quot; is available at Eldritch Press.</a>&#0160;An excerpt from this short story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted. Nicholai Ivanich laughed with joy and for a minute or two he looked in silence at the gooseberries with tears in his eyes. He could not speak for excitement, then put one into his mouth, glanced at me in triumph, like a child at last being given its favourite toy, and said:</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;How good they are!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;He went on eating greedily, and saying all the while:</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;How good they are! Do try one!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;It was hard and sour, but, as Poushkin said, the illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths. I saw a happy man, one whose dearest dream had come true, who had attained his goal in life, who had got what he wanted, and was pleased with his destiny and with himself....&quot;</p>

He wrote about books and life on his weblog &quot;<a href="http://www.thereisnogap.com/" target="_self">there is no gap</a>&quot;. Karl was the owner of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Shaman_Drum" target="_self">Shaman Drum Bookshop</a>, an independent bookstore on Ann Arbor&#39;s State Street which closed in 2009 after a 29 year run.</p>

He had a very strong sense of the material and spiritual value of the reading experience. He was a man with a mission and an unshakeable devotion to the idea that books could transform human beings and the world for the better,&quot; said Bruce Joshua Miller of Miller Trade Marketing in Chicago.&#0160;</p>

He loved to travel and he adored his two daughters, Tanya and Tasha. Family meant the world to him and community...if you were in Karl&#39;s world he was unstintingly loyal. If he loved a book, he&#39;d make sure everyone knew about it. I loved to talk to him about books and always felt on top of the world when I presented him with something that he connected with--it was like a good luck charm for the book and the author!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no public oral history archive dedicated to Detroit music. We are going to build one. You can help. We are going to start with the &quot;first responders&quot; to the Detroit sound: Detroit music journalists. Detroit music journalists have been key archivists of Detroit sounds that have changed the world, from Motown to techno, blues to jazz, to so much more. They have documented the bands. They have interviewed the musicians. They tell the stories so the music lives. This project is for them. This is the Detroit Sound Conservancy&#39;s first project. You can be a part of making this happen.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130710/p10#a130710p10" target="_self">Google Latitude, a location sharing service, is shutting down</a>. There&#39;s not much of a surprise to this; the system was never very popular, with only (by various accounts) <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/354996088366837762" target="_self">5</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/355003689087401984" target="_self">9</a> or some other very small number of people using it. (I kid, but not by much). The best application for it appeared to be very close groups like families who wanted to keep track of where various family members were at the moment. It never got much of a public workout.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used social location sharing services <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/11/plazes_a_100_da.html" target="_self">since Plazes first came out</a> in 2005 or so, and each of them has their obvious utility and the corresponding creepy factor. I think part of the problem is that people don&#39;t know really how to use the extra sense of knowing where their friends are at the moment. There&#39;s a fine line between awareness of where someone else is and the sense that you&#39;re stalking them, and most systems generate at least one creep-out situation before too long and then you decide to back away from them.</p>
<p>The newest location sharing service I&#39;m using is <a href="http://www.waze.com" target="_self">Waze</a>, which bills itself as a social GPS. It is useful if you&#39;re driving, not if you&#39;re walking, and it&#39;s primarily valuable for having better real-time traffic feedback than most GPS systems including the ability to reroute based on actual current conditions. The social aspect is extremely minimal so far (a few beep-beeps at one friend) but the availability of near real time traffic conditions and commentary from in the car is fascinating enough. It does seem to drain the battery of my Nexus 4 more than most apps.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>This blog has had a burst of traffic (hi Boing Boing readers) and as a part of that traffic I&rsquo;m seeing hits coming from news readers. Google Reader had been the dominant RSS reader for a long time, and its demise has given an opportunity for others to gain some currency.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.feedly.com" target="_self">Feedly</a> seems to be the winner so far, with the bulk of the feed-reading traffic to this site coming from there. It benefitted from a one-click transition from Google Reader, as well as a clean minimalist design that puts a lot of information onto the page. I tried their Android client and was much less impressed on first glance.</p>
<p><a href="http://theoldreader.com/" target="_self">The Old Reader</a> comes in at number two; I don&rsquo;t have any direct experience with using it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pulse.me/" target="_self">Pulse.me</a> comes in third - it&rsquo;s a mobile-first app with a Web interface as well.</p>
<p>Finally, it would not be a worthwhile observation without noting that <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_self">Twitter</a> has mostly replaced specialized RSS readers for me - the headline plus link format is very simple and similar to what newsreaders of old provided, and the ease of subscribing and unsubscribing and discovering new feeds is way better than any older feed reading system.</p>
<p>I still miss the old Bloglines reader - more about that <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/07/bloglines_mobil.html" target="_self">here</a> - which was functional even on a Blackberry even in 2005. Times change.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a poll - vote for your preferred reader, or if there is one I didn&rsquo;t find, add it in!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Periodically I look at the sorts of tools that you can use to remember that it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday. Here&#39;s the current things that put birthday reminders in front of me every day.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910422a7a5970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Facebook-birthday-wish" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910422a7a5970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910422a7a5970c-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Facebook-birthday-wish" /></a>The 10,000 lb. gorilla of birthdays is Facebook, which offers a nice simple interface to send a one-line birthday greeting. You could visit Facebook daily just for birthdays and not much more, and be reasonably satisfied with the results. The site offers several convenient ways to send gifts via Starbucks, iTunes, and Target.</p>
<p>The up and coming wannabe of birthdays is Google Plus, which puts birthday notifications on your Plus home screen. I&#39;m not 100% certain where it gets its birthday information from - whether it pulls in details from you Google Contacts data, or if it&#39;s just self-reported birthdays on your Google profile.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has birthday alerts as well, but some people have <a href="http://community.linkedin.com/questions/55441/stop-sending-say-congratulations-on-birthdays-or-a.html" target="_self">complained</a> that the reminders are annoying. There&#39;s no apparent way to turn this feature off in LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a new <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contapps.android&amp;hl=en" target="_self">Contacts +</a> app running on my Android phone, and it reaches into your contact database and reminds you about people who have birthdays today. The handy thing about it is that new birthdays show up as notifications with a one-click to a screen that offers you lots of ways to contact someone, so that if you were to want to send someone a postcard (a few days late, alas) you could be ready for that task.</p>
<p>I still don&#39;t have a great way to routinely get birthday postcards to people on time - that would take a level of daily or weekly commitment and organization that I&#39;m not yet ready to take on!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The&#0160;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is a secretive organization, but it does have a web site. Now Eric Mill (@konklone) is tracking that site&#39;s every change.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://konklone.com/post/following-the-fisa-court-the-internet-way" target="_self">first writeup of it</a> describes version one of a tracking system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, responsible for overseeing the US government&#39;s foreign surveillance activities via FISA, actually does have a&#0160;<a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">public website</a>. They seem to have just created it, as it doesn&#39;t have any documents from before June of 2013, and the Wayback Machine&#0160;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">has no record of it</a>&#0160;prior to that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which relied on&#0160;ChangeDetection and IFTTT to notice changes and publish them to a Twitter feed, @<a href="http://twitter.com/FISACourt" target="_self">FISACourt</a>. He noticed that the system was relatively slow to log changes, so he <a href="http://konklone.com/post/following-the-fisa-court-the-advanced-internet-way" target="_self">rewrote</a> it to poll every 5 minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I wrote some code to check the FISA Court myself, and set it to run every 5 minutes, using my web server (the same machine that serves this blog). You can find the code at&#0160;<a href="https://github.com/konklone/fisa">github.com/konklone/fisa</a>, along with instructions for setting it up yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impressive that a 5-minute setup led to 100 lines of code, and now you can keep pace with the very thin public facing version of a very hard to follow court just by tuning in to another Twitter account.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The phrase &quot;the Rolodex era&quot; popped into my head this morning, and here&#39;s some results I get when I search for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/blog/what-the-digital-age-can-learn-from-the-rolodex-era/" target="_self">What the digital age can learn from the Rolodex era</a>, Full Contact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old school salesmen took notes on business cards, but you can enter your notes electronically. Did your new contact mention their hobbies? &#0160;Their blog? &#0160;Their personal Twitter and Facebook pages that weren’t on their business card? &#0160;How many kids they have? &#0160;What apps they love to use? &#0160;If you take the time to store this information, you can review it before your next meeting and then add personal touches to the conversation. People want to do business with detail-oriented people who care about them as a person.&#0160;</p>

<p><a href="http://shreveportbossierfunguide.com/event.php?id=7855&amp;partner=2" target="_self">9 to 5, The Musical</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the hit 1980 movie of the same name, this outrageous, thought-provoking, and even romantic musical features 12 original songs by Dolly Parton, including that famous title tune.&#0160;It is the story of three unlikely friends who conspire to take control of their company and learn there&#39;s nothing they can&#39;t do -- even in a man&#39;s world. &#0160;Set in the late 1970s, 9 TO 5: THE MUSICAL is a hilarious story of friendship and revenge in the Rolodex era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then I thought, how much better than the previous, one-dimensional Rolodex era! As a marketing director in the era of the ROLODEX, I would sometimes suggest to lawyers that they go through their Rolodex contacts once a week and choose someone to call up just to say,</p>
<p>“Hello, how are you doing? I was thinking about you and thought to give you a call.”</p>
<p>This suggestion was more often than not met with three objections: (1) I don’t have time (2) I don’t feel comfortable doing that, and (3) what would I say after hello?</p>

<p>As I noted in&#0160;<a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=does_emilys_list_still_matter">a July 2008 piece</a>&#0160;for the&#0160;<em>Prospect</em>, EMILY&#39;s List faces significant challenges, none more important than whether its Rolodex-era fundraising techniques are suited to the Internet age.</p>
<p>While the group sometimes ventures online, &quot;most of its money is raised the old-fashioned way, through the mail and one-on-one solicitations, which remains well-suited to the donors the group taps,&quot; I wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My conclusion from this little foray is that the mere mention of a Rolodex makes something sound outmoded, but also that people and organizations that had a good Rolodex strategy could be extremely effective.</p>

I have the sense that there could be much better tools for collecting useful scraps of information about your correspondents, but nothing I&#39;ve seen recently answers the nagging feeling that we could be doing better with this.</p>
<p>The two apps that I have seen that do something different in this space are Evernote Hello and Brewster. </p>
<p>Evernote Hello works cross-platform to help you log contacts through the Evernote platform, so that your contact records can be searched through the normal Evernote system. I have it running on my Android phone, and I use it from time to time (but not religiously) to be mindful of when and where I meet folks. It really wants you to use photography to record the moment, and I&#39;m always hesitant to pull out my camera and take a snapshot of people.</p>
<p>Brewster is a smart address book for iPhone that watches your communications and helps nudge you to reconnect with people who you&#39;ve been out of touch with. I haven&#39;t used it, but reviews have been good. I don&#39;t know their plans to make an Android version.</p>
<p>Mostly I use Google Contacts and the Android People application to keep track, however unevenly, of connections. The biggest plus is that they sync perfectly. The biggest minus is that they are very weak at location-specific searching, so I don&#39;t have an easy way to construct a list of &quot;everyone with an address within 50 miles of Marquette, MI&quot; - a very reasonable desire to be able to do while traveling, but not something directly supported.</p>

<p>A Greasemonkey script to <a href="https://gist.github.com/bluefuton/5907954" target="_self">remove</a> the Yahoo eyebrow uses Javascript. A key element reads</p>
<pre><div id="file-flickr_yahoo_toolbar_hide-user-js-LC18"><blockquote>        document.getElementById(&#39;eyebrow&#39;).style.display = &#39;none&#39;;</blockquote></div></pre>
<p>A second approach uses <a href="http://adblockplus.org/" target="_self">Adblock Plus</a>&#0160;to wipe out the ads for Yahoo services; note, you might have to buy into a lot more than just blocking this ad if you go that route.</p>
<p>A third route uses CSS to hide the offending elements; I saw it fly past this a.m. but can&#39;t find it for the life of me. Anyone? UPDATE: Thanks @davidblivens and @stephaniefysh, I found a Stylish <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/87892/flickr-remove-yahoo-universal-nav" target="_self">script</a> at userstyles.org, with the key element being</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Several streets in Ann Arbor have flooded as a result of slow-moving storm cells that passed through the city on the afternoon of Thursday, June 27, 2013. Reports are still filtering in, but here&rsquo;s what I know about right now.</p>
<p>The City of Ann Arbor is building a “Citizen Storm Corps” volunteer group to assist in stormwater/flooding data collection. Volunteers will visit Large Event Data Gathering locations after significant rain events, record visual observations about the stormwater&rsquo;s behavior at that location using a LEDG Stormwater/Flooding Reporting Form, and submit the data to the city. If interested in volunteering, e-mail stormmodel@a2gov.org.</p>
<p><strong>US-23 at Warren Road</strong></p>

<blockquote>
STREET FLOODING HAS BEEN REPORTED IN ANN ARBOR FROM AROUND 2 INCHES
WITH THE WARREN STREET UNDERPASS OF US 23 FLOODED &amp; CLOSED. WITH
