<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>I've temporarily restyled this weblog with colorful link text, as many people don't realize that I'm linking to things.</p>

<p>The CSS is</p>

<pre>
 a:link    { color: #c00 }  /* unvisited links */
 a:visited { color: #0c0 }  /* visited links   */
 a:hover   { color: #00c }  /* user hovers     */
 a:active  { color: #ccc }  /* active links    */
</pre>

<p>I'm sure it could be better or different; indeed, that style didn't last long before I went to more typical blue for link text and purple for visited links.</p>

      <p>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.</p>

<p>What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that's visibly not the only issue at hand.</p>

      <p>High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.</p>

<p>From various sources including email and twitter; this is surely incomplete.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight's Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled. Bryant Elementary now closed in Ann Arbor due to power outage-caused heating failure. Students that arrived at school sent back home.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor District Library: "The power is out at Malletts Creek Branch, it is currently closed. All other @aadl locations will open at 10 AM. Stay tuned for updates!"</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township offices are closed.</p>

<p>14-B District Court is closed.</p>

<p>Eastern Michigan University: Rec/IM: Due to technical problems, the Jones Pool will be closed until further notice. We apologize for the inconvenience. (via @EMU_Swoop)</p>

<p>Chelsea Police say power is still out and is expected to be out for "the next several hours," as of 8:15 a.m. Chelsea schools have also been closed. (Heritage News) Chelsea Center for the Arts will be closed today, Monday, November 18, 2013 due to a citywide power outage.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c img-responsive" alt="Aael-cvga-300x225" title="Aael-cvga-300x225" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I went with S and J to the <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive</a> (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman">David S. Carter</a> (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. An annual collection budget of about $13,000 buys new games and the occasional old console from eBay. The archive has a near complete collection of US consoles, and Dave said they are looking to expand their international coverage. One of their latest acquisitions was a DVD system that plays only one title. The archive would like to improve its collection of handheld games.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of the next five years is with digital rights management (DRM). The DRM systems envisioned would lock a game to a particular piece of console hardware, making it impossible to have used games and very hard for a library to add a title to a collection. For network-delivered games like Steam it's equally hard for the library to spend $10 on a license, when licenses negotiated by libraries for things like electronic versions of journals are usually for much more.</p>

<p>Dave said the archive was pretty much where they want to be after 5 years. He knew they were on the right track when they got space in the library even before they had a budget. The challenge of next five years is less collection building and more about building connections across campus and around the world to other research collections. He compared the collection to early film and video collections, now standard at all research libraries, but once considered a novelty.</p>

<p>Other comparable collections are at the <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/videogamearchive/index.php">University of Texas at Austin</a> and at <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/03/stanford-libraries-preserves-historical-software-collection-federal-agency">Stanford</a>. Public libraries so not tend to have research collections, preferring to  either use video games strictly for events or to have a circulating collection where you check out current games like any other video or music media.</p>

<p>I asked Dave about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware">Internet Archive's online gaming collection</a>, and especially about the role of emulation in preserving games. He told me that emulation does not preserve original game play, especially the ergonomics of controllers. Playing on original game hardware with original video hardware gives you an accurate rendition of original game play experience. (Besides, you can't play <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005840579">Duck Hunt</a> without an old fashioned TV because the game depends on sensing the scan lines on the TV.) Some old games are very hard to enjoy on original hardware and the limitations of the controls, not the game itself, are what trips up your enjoyment.</p>

Twitter's #<a href="http://www.tchat.io/rooms/miwx">miwx</a> hashtag is useful, as is the amateur radio SKYWARN service which in Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County uses the <a href="http://www.qrz.com/db/N8DUY">N8DUY repeater</a> on 145.15. If you don't have a ham radio, you can tune in to that repeater <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/5230">via Broadcastify</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, no storm would be complete without a watch for power outages. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">big list of power outage maps</a> can be helpful; you will want to be watchful for <a href="http://dteenergy.com/map/outage.html">DTE Energy</a>,<a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap">Consumers Energy</a>, and <a href="https://www.aepcustomer.com/outagemap/main.aspx?region=im">Indiana Michigan Power</a> outage maps in southern Michigan.</p>

      <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Tasty_Green_Cafe">Tasty Green Cafe</a> inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment).</p>

<p>Lunch (a meat pie and a coke) was $5.01. </p>

<p>I talked briefly with City Attorney <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Stephen_Postema">Stephen Postema</a> and his thoughts on proposed FOIA legislation coming from Lansing (he's skeptical). I told him about my new <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/11/welcome-to-foia-friday.html">FOIA Friday column on Damn Arbor</a>, and he recognized Damn Arbor because it once wrote about his <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2011/04/what-if-anything-is-hipster.html">status as a hipster</a> (he's not).</p>

<p>Environmental Coordinator <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Matt_Naud">Matt Naud</a> and I talked about the upcoming <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech meetup</a>, and he referred me to the <a href="https://www.wegowise.com/">WeGoWise</a> program in Boston that's reducing people's energy and water bills - similar, in spirit at least, to the <a href="https://dteenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=26817&amp;item=72330">OPower insert</a> in my recent DTE bill that told us we used a lot of electricity compared to our neighbors.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222614&amp;GUID=3890EFBC-18C0-4B89-A44B-B72A3143DAD5&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting agenda</a> for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.</p>

<p>As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/13/nov-18-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a>. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/repeal_of_ann_arbors_controver.html">Ann Arbor News story</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.m. it's not on the agenda, but Ann Arbor News reporter Ryan Stanton suggests on twitter that the disposition of the Old Y Lot may make it onto the agenda tonight, with council asked to accept the Dahlmann bid. 5:05 p.m. Now on the PDF agenda as "DC-4 13-1467 Resolution to Approve Sale of City-Owned Property at 350 S. Fifth to Dennis A. Dahlmann (8 Votes Required)".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Word is that Dennis Dahlmann has accepted all of the city&#39;s terms and Y Lot sales agreement could be voted on tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=hash">#a2council</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Stanton (@ryanjstanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton/statuses/402543766415757312">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This will be the first meeting for new City Council member Jack Eaton, who defeated Twenty Pound Carp in the general election in November 2013.</p>

<p>Council will appoint a Mayor Pro Tem, to serve as acting Mayor when there is no mayor available. Traditionally this has gone to the most senior member of council by tenure, and I think that might be Margie Teall; the Chronicle hints that Jane Lumm might have the nod.</p>

<p>MC-1 Mayoral appointments look uncontroversial.</p>

<p>PH-1, B-1 "Pizza in the park", a waiver of fees for parks activities that provide basic human services, looks like it's likely to pass based on last week's discussion.</p>

<p>PH-2, B-2 "DDA Revisions" is probably going to take a long time, as various members of council try to make political points regarding the relative balance of services between the downtown and the neighborhoods. Make popcorn.</p>

<p>CA-1 "The Puck Drops Here" is a 31 December 2013 event (details?) to be held just before the 1 January 2014 Winter Classic NHL hockey game.</p>

<p>CA-2 "Hockey is just like football" as far as parking restrictions and street closings goes.</p>

<p>CA-3 Dawn Farm has agreed to acquire 618 N. Main from Avalon Housing.</p>

<p>DC-1 "Ypsi Township on AAATA board" Council gets to decide whether Ypsilanti Township has a seat on the AAATA transit authority board. It was a matter of controversy when it came up the first time; keep up with the popcorn.</p>

<p>DC-4 "Dahlmann proposal for Old Y Lot" This showed up on the agenda at the last possible moment, to the point where it's not clear that members of council will get a chance to read it before voting on it; certainly no one had a chance to put their name in for public commentary on this item. I'm hopeful that this resolution will be postponed until next time for a vote.</p>

<p>DS-2, DS-3, DS-4 Easement swaps with the University of Michigan for a new conduit through the Arboretum, and a new survey to settle a disputed boundary between the city and the university. </p>

<p>G-1. The Greenbelt Advisory Commission has minutes to approve from 2011 (!!!).</p>

<p>G-2. The Public Art Commission has minutes to approve from January and Feburary 2012 (!!!)</p>

<p>G-6, G-7, G-8, G-9 The Taxicab board has been very slow to produce minutes; these date back to January 2013.</p>

<p>Not on the agenda yet is a possible purchase agreement for the "Old Y Lot".</p>

<p>This is a snapshot of news coverage at 9:15 pm Eastern on November 12, 2013, and is bound to be updated by local media as details emerge.</p>

  <p>While there have been preliminary estimates of 10,000 dead in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. "Local government officials think the number could reach 20 or 30 thousand people," Al Jazeera's Margot Ortigas reported from Manila.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Weather reports from Dr Jeff Masters at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2576">Weather Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a preliminary death toll of 1,200, Haiyan already ranks as the 8th deadliest typhoon in Philippines history. The deadliest typhoon in Philippines history was Typhoon Thelma of 1991, which killed between 5101 - 8000 people, reports wunderground's weather historian Christopher C. Burt in his latest post on Philippines typhoon history. Haiyan will become the deadest typhoon in Philippines history if the estimates today of 10,000 dead hold up. Bloomberg Industries is estimating insured damages of $2 billion and total economic damages of $14 billion, making Haiyan the most expensive natural disaster in Philippines history. This is the third time in the past 12 months the Philippines have set a new record for their most expensive natural disaster in history. The record was initially set by Typhoon Bopha of December 2012, with $1.7 billion in damage; that record was beaten by the $2.2 billion in damage done by the August 2013 floods on Luzon caused by moisture associated with Typhoon Trami.</p>

<p>Former Milwaukee Brewers executive Edmund Bacon Fitzgerald, known as "Younger Ed" to distinguish him from his father, died in September 2013 at the age of 87. Fitzgerald helped bring baseball back to Milwaukee in 1970 after the departure of the Braves; the ship was named after his father, an executive with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. The <a href="http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/545/article/p2p-77327418/">Chicago Tribune</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the 30th anniversary of the wreck in 2005, he recalled meeting Lightfoot at a dinner hosted by the Canadian prime minister in the 1980s.  "I told him what my name was, and he looked rather surprised," Fitzgerald said of the Canadian singer-songwriter. Fitzgerald called Lightfoot's homage to the ship a "fine song."</p>

<p>MC-1, Mayoral appointments. Nothing obviously controversial here. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Cyndi_Clark">Cyndi Clark</a> is proposed to fill a vacancy on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ann_Arbor_DDA">Ann Arbor DDA</a> board; she's the owner of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Lily_Grace">Lily Grace</a>.</p>

<p>B-1. DDA Ordinance. Four items of substance in the proposed revision (as of v3): 1) Remove the mayor from the DDA board as of the end of the current mayor's term, and replace with the city administrator. 2) Recalculate TIF funding mechanism and the return of surplus funds to taxing entities.  3) "Requires a nexus between development programs and specifically benefited properties within the downtown development district." 4) Requires TIF report in January, and requires DDA programs to be part of the city's Capital Improvement Project (CIP) process. Expect this to take a long time to sort out.</p>

<p>C-1. "Pizza in the Park". Changes the Parks ordinance to omit fees for events "where the permitted event's primary proposed activity is the charitable distribution of goods for basic human needs." Permits are still required.</p>

<p>DC-1. "Stadium Billboard". Directs the city administrator to complain to the University of Michigan about the new digital billboard on E Stadium Blvd near Michigan Stadium.</p>

<p>DC-3. "Ethics". Directs the city administrator and city attorney to educate city council on professional conduct, and directs the Council Rules Committee to draft standards of conduct.</p>

<p>DS-10. Design the Scio Church Road sidewalk, $35,000 from general fund.</p>

<p>THE ENERGY IN DETROITS ASSETS</p>

<p>LED BY Dr. Jill Van Horn</p>

<p>Mark Day remarks to the Board:</p>

<p>"What is it that fixes the potential of the asset, so that it can put additional production into motion?"</p>

<p>What detaches value from a simple old plant such as Packard and fixes Detroiters to realize it as capital?</p>

<p>We can begin to finally answer by using an energy analogy that was put forth by Hernando Deesoto.</p>

<p>Consider Mountain Lake we can think about this lake in its immediate physical context and see come primary use for it such as canoeing and fishing.</p>

<p>But when we think about this same lake as an engineer would, by focusing on its capacity to generate energy as an additional value beyond the lakes natural state as a body of water. We suddenly see the potential created by the lakes elevated position. The challenge for the engineer, is the same challenge that all Detroiters face today, finding out how he can create a process that allows him to convert and fix this potential into a form that can be used to do additional work. IN the case of the elevated lake, that process is contained in a hydroelectric plant that allows the lake water to move rapidly downward with the force of gravity. Thereby transforming the placid lakes potential into the kinetic energy of tumbling water. This electric magnets that further convert into electrical energy.</p>

<p>As electricity, the potential energy of the Placid Lake is now fixed in the form necessary to produce controllable current that can be further transmitted through wire conductors in faraway places to display new production. Apparently Placid Lake can be used to light your room and power the machinery in a factory.</p>

<p>What was required was an external man made process that allowed us, first, to identify the weight of the water, second, convert this potential energy into electricity, which can then be used to create surplus value. The additional value we obtain form the lake I not the value of the lake itself, but rather the value of the manmade process intricate of the lake.</p>

<p>It is the process that allows us to transform the lake form a canoeing and fishing kind of place into an energy producing kind of place. Detroit's assets, like energy, also have a dormant value.</p>

<p>Bringing them to life requires Detroiters to go beyond looking at the city's asset as they are actively thinking about them as they could be.</p>

<p>It required a sophisticated process for fixing Detroit's assets economical potential into a form that can be used to make additional production. Although the process to convert the potential energy in the water into electricity is well known. The one that gives Detroit's assets the form required to put in motion. More production is not known, in other words while we know that it is the pin stop, turbaned, generators, transformers, and wires of the hydro-electric energy system, that convert the potential energy of the lake until it is fixed in a accessible form. We do not know where to find the key process that connects the economic potential of that Detroiters can benefit from.</p>

<p>This is because that key process has never been deliberately set up for Detroiters. Under the development plans that Jill Van Horn has co designed for Detroit. The city will develop through a variety of financial mechanisms that gradually will combine into a process that will churn out capital as never before.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese, Chinese and our financiers on Wall Street use their mechanisms all the time. Detroiters do not realize that none of the essential capital generating functions is being utilized in their area. Historically Detroiters used them as parts of the Banking and Financial system, but not as interlocking mechanism for fixing the economic potential of Detroit's assets in such a way that they can be converted into capital for all Detroiters benefit.</p>

<p>This may sound complex, but consider the Penobscot building that sold for approximately
5 million dollars, but contains more than 1,000,000 square feet of luxurious office space. Then consider single family housing selling for $1,000.00 which contained more than 1,600 square feet. Then consider entire city block that are being sold for 100.00 a lot, further consider the millions of square feet in apartment buildings scattered throughout the city. Finally consider the fact that Detroit is in Bankruptcy and so is its sister city Hyland Park.</p>

<p>Now is not the time for native Detroiters to bicker over the price of the Packard Plant. Now is the time to form a coalition made of past and future developers in order to make a change in Detroit. Utilizing the private investors, the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, International Bankers, and Faith Based Organizations located through the city to pull it up by its boot straps and make it whole again.</p>

<p>Dr Van Horn has assembled the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, Private Investors and several Foundations, who intend to merge their financial resources with the local developers in Detroit, to transform the dormant capital the lies in every real estate parcel in the city of Detroit, into a fixed value of capital that will benefit all of the cities residence.</p>

<p>Prior to placing the bid on the Packard Plant, Dr. Van Horn's prophecy was to resurrect Detroit by providing education, jobs and vocational training to the city's residence, simultaneously unplugging the financial arteries of the city.</p>

<p>That decision was based on the gravity of the hour and the magnitude of potential jobs that the plant offers for the people of Detroit.</p>

<p>"Any intelligent foal can make things bigger, more complex and more violent. it takes a touch of genius-- and a let of courage to move in the opposite direction." Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Dr. Van Horn's partners consist of all af the non--profit developers who elther own land or have designated development areas within the city. Furthermore, if the county doubts that we have the ability to perform, we challenge the caunty by stating at this time, Dr. Van Horn and her lenders, investors are prepared to travel fram Texas to Detroit and sit down with the county and make an offer for every vacant, abandoned and dilapidated apartment building within Detroit. Not only are we prepared to show that we have the ability to perform, but we are ready to perform.</p>

<p>2012 was a disaster for Michigan apple growers, but 2013 has been a good year. From <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131024/ARTICLE/131029937">Capital Press</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.</p>
  
  <p>Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.</p>
  
  <p>“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the limiting factors in the apple harvest is the availability of seasonal workers to pick the crop. Last year was a bad year and some migrants resettled to other states. From <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/michigan_apple_crop_migrant_wo.html">MLive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market demand also will play a role in determining how many apples are left in the fields or sent to packers and processors, said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee that represents some 850 family-owned orchards.</p>
  
  <p>Smith estimates the apple harvest workforce is short about 20 percent. Labor has been the industry's top concern for many years, since it's tough to find an adequate skilled workforce, she said, adding that immigration policies that allow migrant workers to go back and forth between the U.S. and their home countries would help.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://record-eagle.com/latest-mobile/x1909741911/Migrant-worker-shortage-hits-orchards-in-Traverse-City-area/print">Traverse City Record-Eagle</a> notes the impact in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some affected growers, particularly in the Grand Rapids area, are prioritizing and picking only varieties that have the best financial return, said Jim Bardenhagen, an area fruit and vegetable farmer and retired 20-year Leelanau County extension director.</p>
  
  <p>Bardenhagen said several area farmers told him that only about half of migrant workers needed to pick apples in the region came to northwestern lower Michigan this year and that many are new to the work. He personally lost only one worker in his crew of three. Area crews generally can vary from about five to 30.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a good year to look for orchards that are doing a gleaner's harvest to donate to local food banks.</p>

<p>Borders was an Ann Arbor based bookstore that grew from a single store into a worldwide bookselling leader. It closed its doors in 2011 after 40 years in business. This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/12/first.borders.bookstore.closing/index.html">CNN story</a> gives a good history of its rise and fall. <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> is an independent bookstore that opened in Ann Arbor in 2013, inheriting several former Borders employees and a number of its bookshelves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As CEO of a fast-growing high tech company, and mentor and advisor to many other innovative, venture-backed startups here, I can personally testify to the challenges of building a company downtown. All of my prior companies have been split between Ann Arbor and elsewhere, with most of their economic impact (hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs, services, investment, and spin-offs) outside of Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of Dug's prior companies was <a href="http://arbornetworks.com">Arbor Networks</a>, which split itself between Ann Arbor and the Boston area. Arbor was <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2010-press-releases/1994-tektronix-communications-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbor-networks">acquired in 2010</a> by Tektronix Communications, a division of Danaher. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to see us reverse that trend. We have had far too many world-changing technology companies start in Ann Arbor, but leave to grow their people and fortunes elsewhere. It's often for the most mundane of reasons that 20- and 30-somethings here understand all too well.</p>
  
  <p>We need a city council that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, open governance, and good kindergarten skills, but also promotes a vision of positive growth for our community. In today's economy, if we aren't busy growing, we're just slowly dying, and I've been terrified by the Tea Party-like obstructionism I've seen from council members on issues of development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "Tea Party" label has been applied to opponents on City Council before, most notably via the anonymous weblog "Middle of the Left" which uses the term <a href="http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/">Teapublicans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, I support Kirk Westphal, Democratic candidate in Ward 2 for Ann Arbor city council. His vision of a vital, walkable downtown supporting diversity, density, and dynamism is a recipe for <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/">placemaking</a>, and a natural engine for economic growth. We need downtown Ann Arbor to be a real place again and not just a hollowed-out franchise of Traverse City minus the bay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference to "franchise of Traverse City" alludes to several TC based businesses that have set up shop in Ann Arbor, including Cherry Republic and the restaurants Blue Tractor and Jolly Pumpkin.</p>

<p>Concentrate has a <a href="http://www.concentratemedia.com/features/ScottLanktonBlacksmith0258.aspx">feature on Scott Lankton</a>, an Ann Arbor blacksmith. You'll see his car (a VW with an anvil on the roof) around town.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan is known for what it has been able to forge out of metal and steel. Scott Lankton takes that to a whole other level. As a master blacksmith he's forged everything from a sword for the British Museum to hand-wrought railings for local clients. Concentrate's Patrick Dunn chats with this local artisan about living and working in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324202304579053033444112314">FOIA laws are fueling hedge fund profits</a>. Savvy investors are getting information from government records to help them make decisions before the information is widely known in the market. "One firm, FOI Services Inc., accounted for about 10% of the 50,000 information requests sent to the FDA during the period examined by the Journal."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A review by The Wall Street Journal of more than 100,000 of the roughly three million FOIA requests filed over the past five years, including all of those sent to the FDA, shows that investors use the process to troll for all kinds of information. They ask the Environmental Protection Agency about pollution regulations, the Department of Energy about grants for energy-efficient vehicles, and the Securities and Exchange Commission about whether publicly held companies are under investigation. Such requests are perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Sam Kriss has a wonderful <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/book-of-lamentations/">reading of the psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-5</a>, treating it as a dystopian novel. In the "Book of Lamentations", he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something has gone terribly wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any real fulfillment. The newly published DSM-5 is a classic dystopian novel in this mold.</p>
  
  <p>It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an unwieldy mouthful: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The author (or authors) writes under the ungainly nom de plume of The American Psychiatric Association – although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone; within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd, chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.</p>

      <p>This <a href="http://aqicn.org/map/china/">real time air pollution in China map</a> is from aqicn.info, which describes itself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The aqicn.info team is a young and dynamic team located in Beijing, China, and composed of two professionals working for the product engineering and design industries
  All the credits must go to the US Embassies in China for initially providing and publishing their PM.25 air quality measurement, as well as the China MEP for the huge effort in providing PM2.5 for so many cities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to national maps, they have detailed charts of current and recent air quality for a number of Chinese cities. In this chart, the purple readings are the least healthy air, and only a few cities in the northeast (including Beijing) have readings that are only moderatly unhealthy. Though not depicted here, there are also maps of <a href="http://aqicn.org/map/">all of Asia</a> as well as individual country maps for Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, and other individual countries in more detail.</p>
