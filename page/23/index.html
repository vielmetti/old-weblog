        <p>An earthquake hit the island of Bohol in the Philippines at 8:12 a.m. local time (0012 UTC) on 15 October 2013, resulting in numerous fatalities (93 as of this writing, but the total is likely to be revised upwards). Nearby Cebu City was also shaken. Over 400,000 families have been affected, according to the NDRRMC (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council). Map from Phivolcs.

The effort to rebuild the corner coffee shop under a new name is expected to take a couple of weeks, with a planned opening date in mid-November.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says illnesses have been reported in 17 states, with the vast majority — 78 percent — in California.

        <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.GOV, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load? Reuters took a look at the issue, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design. Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-06-slow-obamacare-registration-denial-of-service-attack-or-self-inflicted-injury/">&raquo;</a></p>
