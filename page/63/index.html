        <p>Here&#39;s some notes about parallel computing, going in two directions at the same time.&#0160; In one direction you have tools like Map/Reduce or Hadoop managing the work of parceling a problem into many pieces and then coordinating the collection of those pieces.&#0160; In another direction you have graphics chips being turned into interesting general purpose parallel computing chips that can do some specific operations very fast.

Kennecott Minerals bought the property last September with plans to process ore from its proposed Eagle Project.

I envied my older sister her uninterruptability. While I looked up immediately from my book when my name was called, she had the uncanny ability not to hear. I would test her as she read. It was like addressing a stone, except that with a stone, if we are imaginative enough, we can infer some kind of response albeit in stone language. My sister appeared to be present, but she was in the book. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-08-uninterruptability-reading-and-attention/">&raquo;</a></p>

Next Tuesday, Feb. 10, the Upper Peninsula&#39;s Pasty Cam will publish its 4,000th consecutive daily picture and discussion. That&#39;s nearly 11 years without missing a single day.
