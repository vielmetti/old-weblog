<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

They will sound cumbersome and abstract. You will be able to skip
some of the steps as you get established in your field,
but if you are starting from zero then the process really is quite complicated. 
1) Know your goals. 2) Identify relevant people. 3) Court these people 
individually. 4) Meet these people face-to-face at a professional meeting.
5) Exchange drafts. 6) Follow up. Lets look at each in turn.<br /></div><p><br />More from <a href="http://delicious.com/vielmetti/agre,phil">Phil Agre</a> (via delicious).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Matt Hampel has released <a href="http://matth.org/ctn/">a study of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Television Network</a>.&#0160; He writes about an organization that was innovative and forward-looking in the 1970s that is now running with little public oversight and with only the most tentative ways of engaging with the public through networks other than cable television.</p>
<p>Most notable in the whole discussion is <a href="http://matth.org/ctn/?p=57">a comparison of CTN&#39;s video archiving and online access system with a similar setup at the Ann Arbor District Library</a>.&#0160; The library has direct access into the CTN digital network feeds, and uses off the shelf software to transcode video for delivery to cable.&#0160; Where CTN is hamstrung by a reliance on city IT staff to do technology development - an IT staff that only does necessary maintenance - the AADL has an active IT department that is doing development in support of their mission.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that the people at CTN are doing a good job at their core mission, of teaching people how to do video production.&#0160; The system is failing where it fails because there is not a corresponding core set of priority on video distribution and access beyond their cable television franchise.&#0160; The whole system looks like it would be better off if CTN lopped off the approximately $180,000 per year they spend on City of Ann Arbor IT services and instead merged that effort into <a href="http://www.aadl.org/video">the Ann Arbor District Library&#39;s existing video efforts.&#0160; </a>That would put both innovative production and innovative distribution under the same roof, and move citizens closer to access to <a href="http://deoxy.org/seize_it.htm#p11">public production libraries</a> to let them be the media, not just consume it on channel 19.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>When the AATA mobile ride track is up, I have a script that runs periodically to decode the web pages and turn them into data.&#0160; The pages are formatted for humans, so I need to do screen scraping on them to reconstruct the original data values.</p><p>There are a lot of tools for screen scraping, with each of them appealing to a programmer who has a certain world view of the web and how things are put together.&#0160; The tool that I find myself recommending when someone who sounds like a programmer asks is <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> (for python) or <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/RubyfulSoup/">Rubyful Soup</a> (for ruby), in part at least because the coder&#39;s attitude toward pragmatism is appropriate for the task at hand:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">You didn&#39;t write that awful page. You&#39;re just trying to get some
data out of it. Right now, you don&#39;t really care what HTML is
supposed to look like.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Neither does this parser.&#0160;</p><p>Rubyful Soup&#39;s page says &quot;no longer maintained, try hpricot instead&quot;; I looked for hpricot and got some 404s.&#0160; Not sure really what&#39;s up with that.</p><p>As for what I really do, rather than what I recommend, well you have to understand that most of the code that I write that actually does anything useful is less than a page of text and mostly is full of regular expressions.&#0160;&#0160; HTML in its unadorned state is mostly resistant to simple-minded regex parsing, but if you constrain the world enough you can get most data out of most pages by running the page through a preprocessor that normalizes it into something sane.</p><p>My favorite for that effort is the old school &quot;<a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>&quot; application, which has a zillion options by now for taking your weird web pages and making them pass syntax checks.&#0160;</p><p>Thus the source of the main loop for the &quot;mobile ride guide decoder&quot;:</p><p><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">curl -s -o $TMP/route.5.html http://mobile.theride.org/rideguide_m.asp?route=5</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">tidy -f /dev/null -q -w 0 -o $TMP/route.5.tidy.html $TMP/route.5.html</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Courier;">perl ./mobiletocsv.pl &lt; $TMP/route.5.tidy.html &gt;&gt; route.5.log.csv</span></p><p>and the &quot;mobiletocsv&quot; perl script is very simple minded</p><p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">#!perl</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">while(&lt;&gt;) {</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /AS OF (\d+:\d\d)/ &amp;&amp; ($curtime = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; $realtime = `date +%H:%M`;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; chop $realtime;</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) min behind/ &amp;&amp; ($late = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) min ahead/ &amp;&amp; ($late = -$1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d+) on time/i &amp;&amp; ($late = 0);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d\d\d) to (Ann Arbor|Ypsilanti)/ &amp;&amp; ($busno = $1, $dest = $2);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /(\d\d\d) (OutBound|Loop)/ &amp;&amp; ($busno = $1, $dest = $2);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /^@ (.*)&lt;br&gt;/ &amp;&amp; ($curloc = $1);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; /^(.*) (\d+:\d\d)/ &amp;&amp; ($newloc = $1, $timepoint = $2,</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; print &quot;$realtime,$curtime,$late,$busno,$dest,$curloc,$newloc,$timepoint\n</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">&quot;);</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Courier;">}</span></p><p>It&#39;s probably not resistant to aggressively malformed input, and I simply don&#39;t run it when the result is &quot;please check your timetable for times&quot;.&#0160; </p><p>The first and second iterations that I wrote of this code tried to do it all without any tidy step, and it was hard especially because I had to try to parse syntax and parse data in the same step.&#0160; This version is compact enough that it might reasonably be the jumping off point for future enhancements.&#0160; </p><p>still waiting for the bus data to come back....<span style="font-family: Courier;"></span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier;"></span></p>

      </h3>
      <p>While <a href="http://theride.org/SystemDown.asp">waiting for the AATA&#39;s mobile ridetrak system to go back online</a> (it&#39;s been down for two weeks now due to <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2008/12/16/local-groups-scramble-after-ias-eviction/">a series of unfortunate events</a>), I&#39;ve been thinking about how to model the network of bus and pedestrian routes so that you could say some useful things about the goodness of a given route network for a particular task at a particular time of day.&#0160; What I&#39;m after is understanding just how far I can reasonably go from where I am to somewhere else useful based on bus routes, my willingness or ability to walk, and the minute by minute information about how late the bus is.</p><p>Frankly, this is a complex set of questions to answer, especially if you&#39;re unwilling to wait outside for the bus and if you&#39;re willing to ride unfamiliar buses to new destinations.&#0160; Most people figure out how a single route does between two places at two particular times, sorting through the commuter problem and coming up with a rough rule of thumb that depends on the bus being more or less predictably late.&#0160;&#0160; By the time you sort through all of the details to get somewhere new, the bus might have gone by.</p><p>Some observations, numbered, probably requiring each of them to have more details.</p><p>1.&#0160; Always carry a paper schedule.&#0160; If the bus computer system is down again, or your phone is out of battery, a piece of paper no matter how confusing is probably better than nothing.</p><p>2.&#0160; Some places are better to wait than others.&#0160; The cost of being wrong about a bus when you&#39;re at the Blake Transit Center is small, because there&#39;s a warm place to wait and because there are six buses an hour that go to or near enough to my house to be reasonable to get on.&#0160; Contrairiwise, missing a bus by 1 minute on some routes might mean you would wait for an hour (or more).&#0160; </p><p>3.&#0160; Close by stops might really be far away.&#0160; This is a function of pedestrian access - if you need to cross a busy street to get to a stop, it might take two, three, or five minutes to cross between lights and perhaps even a 20 minute hike if you look at the worst pedestrian crossing (Washtenaw at Platt).&#0160; A naive pedestrian distance measure is going to be wrong.</p><p>4.&#0160; All roads lead to downtown.&#0160; With a few exceptions, the Ann Arbor route system is about getting people to the center of Ann Arbor.&#0160; You&#39;ll have a lot better luck getting anywhere if you go downtown first and use it as the base of operations.&#0160;&#0160; I looked at &quot;optimal routes&quot; from home to some places nearby and the best way to get there was a 20+ minute walk, and there are too many destinations where the trip by bus is 40+ minutes for what is a 10 minute drive.&#0160; </p><p>5.&#0160; The University bus system, although frequent, is not integrated with the AATA system.&#0160; This is most notable when you look at Google Transit to plan a trip and notice that it doesn&#39;t ever put you on a UM bus.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Many of the UM buses run frequently enough during my time to use them that no schedule is necessary, but you have to always be prepared to do a transfer of a random, maximum time if you&#39;re switching lines.</p><p>The model that I had in mind for looking at this whole system was to make a big graph, with each node on the graph being a plausible location to be at and the edges being the time to go to the next node.&#0160; There would be a pedestrian network reflecting the sidewalks and bus stops, and a bus network overlaid on top of it where if you were on the bus you could move from node to node but if you weren&#39;t on the bus you&#39;d have to wait.&#0160; Some nodes would be warm (cafes, libraries) and some would be cold and slushy (most bus stops).&#0160; </p><p>This graph becomes the playing board for a big urban game.&#0160; You and all of the other players start at various points on the board, and each minute you take a turn either walking to a next node, staying still where you are, or riding on a bus.&#0160; The winner after 60 turns is the person who managed to get the highest score - whether it be maximum minutes on a bus, maximum distance from origin, maximum distance walking, interesting destinations reached, or any other measure you&#39;d like to score.&#0160; Minus points for wet boots.&#0160; Double minus points for missing the kids pickup from day care.</p><p>As you can see from thinking about this game a little bit, you can play a lot more effectively if you know where all of the buses are.&#0160; Instead of getting negative points for the boot-minutes you spend shivering at the stop, you can accumulate credits indoors until the last minute necessary to get outside.&#0160;&#0160; Knowing that an infrequent bus is close by lets you get bonus points for going to stops that are close by but not often served, and it lets you avoid missed connections where the schedule says you can get from one line to another but you won&#39;t make that connection when the outbound line is late.</p><p>---</p><p>I&#39;m collecting a bunch of links about this on delicious - see <a href="http://delicious.com/vielmetti/where-is-my-fracking-bus">http://delicious.com/vielmetti/where-is-my-fracking-bus</a> for my idiosyncratic collection, and more generally if you are looking at transportation literature a key term is <a href="http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/search.do?new=&amp;b1=9&amp;f1=ht&amp;t1=Automatic+vehicle+location&amp;d=">automatic vehicle location</a>.&#0160;

      </h3>
      <p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">Twitter zero</a>&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar number</a> and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; </p><p>The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again.&#0160; Less of a burden than the accumulated drag of other systems that I had given up on but that still had <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/retrenching-on-web-20-controlling-your-presence-by-turning-off-abandoned-services.html">remnant shards of a previous me</a>, but still a burden.</p><p>As of yesterday I have switched to the &quot;follow everyone who follows you&quot; strategy - as close to strict reciprocity as I can.&#0160; If someone is really awful I&#39;ll block them, but for the most part even the single-threaded marketing droids are bearable if they are mixed in with enough other people.&#0160; At noon Eastern on a Tuesday the front page of my Twitter has 17 minutes worth of stuff in it and I&#39;m about 1/3 of the way through following everyone, so at some point the balance will be &quot;wait five minutes and the front page will have completely changed&quot;.</p><p>This is quite frankly a change from any of my previous tactics and I&#39;m going to be as deliberate about it as I can.&#0160; Here&#39;s a pointless numbered list of iron-clad rules.</p><p>1.&#0160; To keep a conversation going you have to use the @ convention to refer to someone by name, or else the dialog gets lost.&#0160; Twitter stops being a small group extended chat and starts to be some extended group distributed semi-broadcast.&#0160;&#0160; Checking the &quot;replies&quot; tab becomes part of making sure that if there&#39;s a conversation that happened between sessions you can get back to it.&#0160; Every so often you get some little knot of people all online at once going back and forth at each other, but that&#39;s not what you can count on.</p><p>2.&#0160; If you have anything of lasting substance to say, refer to something already written, whether it be a blog post, a delicious tag stream, or something else that is more than 140 characters long.&#0160;&#0160; Everything is scrolling by so fast in this world that if you need to anchor a discussion it can&#39;t be anchored in more and more twitters.&#0160; Blogging becomes more important, not less, in this approach - if it doesn&#39;t fit in one line you have to refer to it somehow.</p><p>3.&#0160; If you play Twitter this way there will always be something more to look at - it&#39;s a never ending game.&#0160; So to keep the time commitment finite and bounded you need to figure out when to stop and just turn it off.&#0160;&#0160; You have to stop some time - figure out how many pages deep in the scroll back you are going to watch, and then quit.&#0160; <strong>If you keep refreshing it will never, ever stop.</strong>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>4.&#0160; As a never ending game the scoring rules clearly change as you play it.&#0160; Various &quot;twitter metrics&quot; have been proposed that mostly boil down to &quot;increase the n&quot;.&#0160; If my earlier explorations are accurate, the counter-tactic of &quot;decrease the n&quot; is just as valuable - going down to zero helped me think about the system carefully.&#0160; I&#39;ve never tried to follow 800+ people before, but I guess now I&#39;ll have a chance to try.&#0160; There&#39;s a stable, winning strategy where the goal is to &quot;<strong>change the n</strong>&quot; - cycle systematically from 0 to max(n) and then back to 0, every day either turning people on or turning people off but never staying the same; the rules of that game are that at every turn you have to change the number of followers you have.</p><p>5.&#0160; People love pointless numbered lists.&#0160; Use them.</p><p>--</p><p>What you lose is the sense of a quiet place where all of your close friends from around town hang out online.&#0160;&#0160; What you gain is some broader sense of the world.&#0160; </p>

      <p>If there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &quot;free&quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&#39;s advertising there sponsoring it.</p><p>With the retrenching in Web 2.0 properties - either sites getting bought up and closed down, abandoned by their new owners, orphaned, or mutated beyond recognition in the search for profit, it&#39;s time to start looking closely at what kinds of remnant &quot;internet presence&quot;

It&#39;s a relic, and I think I&#39;l keep it as a relic, in part because I used to have a functioning design that had a nice ever-growing ad hoc sidebar full of marginalia and none of the Typepad designs really support that well.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?edward_vielmetti">Edward Vielmetti - Socialtext Customer Exchange</a> - yikes, a wiki.&#0160; It should get a copy of the standard bio.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/edward-vielmetti/">Flickr</a> - Not many photos uploaded since my camera died a technicolor death.&#0160; My bio is about two years out of date, and it doesn&#39;t have the current picture.&#0160; I&#39;m increasingly irritated by Flickr&#39;s cutesiepie error messages, which don&#39;t line up with their unpleasant treatment of key staff.&#0160; When my Pro account runs out I probably won&#39;t renew it, which means I need to unpublish about 130 photos.</p><p><a href="http://edwardvielmetti.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> - Like a bad penny, it follows you around, collecting scraps of things that you once fed it and keeping them for all eternity.&#0160; There was once a time when I used Jaiku when Twitter was down, but it&#39;s been so thoroughly orphaned by Google that it&#39;s hardly worth the bother.&#0160; &#0160; </p><p><a href="http://plazes.com/users/5955">Plazes</a> - Like a bad pfennig, it follows you around, collecting scraps of information about where you were and remembering them for all time.&#0160; I used to use Plazes, but enough creepy encounters from people who were unsubtle about the uses of always-on geolocation soured me on the use of any remote location tracking software ever again. </p><p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/people/view/4400930-vielmetti">Scribd</a> - Hey, once upon a time I created an account!&#0160; I hope they have password recovery.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10XJYJ0AHB3QY">Amazon</a> - This bio is a few years old.&#0160; Do I really want to share my wish list - which no one has ever bought me anything from - with the world?&#0160; After all I don&#39;t really use it as a wish list, just a way to bookmark things within Amazon.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Edward_Vielmetti">Wikipedia</a> - Eeek!&#0160; A wiki. &#0160; Not very useful or helpful as a profile page, perhaps that&#39;s just as well.</p><p><a href="http://portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100105173">ACM Portal</a> - Only one publication; gotta get on that.</p><p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/edward.vielmetti">Pandora</a> - I haven&#39;t used this in how many years?&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/16128/">Meetup</a> - Party like it&#39;s 2002.</p><p><a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Edward_Vielmetti">Xing</a> - If I&#39;m going to really use this, then it needs a complete overhaul - what&#39;s there is also woefully out of date.&#0160; I&#39;d be better off starting over.</p><p><a href="http://a2skatepark.org/profile/EdwardVielmetti">a2skatepark</a> - eek!&#0160; Ning, I think, gets the credit or blame for this skeletal self-description.</p><p><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/directory/profile/38654936346/209b82c7/Edward/Vielmetti">Plaxo</a> - eek!&#0160; Needs work.</p><p><a href="http://www.plodt.com/vielmetti/">plodt</a> - huh?&#0160; I never remember signing up for this, but it seems to be stalking me.</p><p><a href="http://www.vegguide.org/user/597">VegGuide</a> - I apparently used this once back in 2004, and it hasn&#39;t forgetten about me yet.&#0160; Yet.</p><p><a href="http://www.43things.com/person/edwardvielmetti">43 Things</a> - For a brief shining moment in 2004 this was interesting; now it&#39;s just more crap on the net beyond my direct control.&#0160; I hope they have password recovery.</p><p><a href="http://360.yahoo.com/profile-FOLvu.o0ba8lWOZm5gQ86w--?cq=1">Yahoo 360</a> - I had hoped that they had killed this off, but I guess they didn&#39;t; the sleeping baby on the front page is now almost 4 years old.&#0160; (cute kid, huh?)</p><p><a href="http://www.listphile.com/a2b3_membership_roster/Edward_Vielmetti">ListPhile</a> - I hope they have password recovery; I don&#39;t remember ever signing up for it, but there I am larger than life.&#0160; Huh?</p><p><a href="http://edwardvielmetti.vox.com/">Vox</a> - I&#39;m averaging about a post every six months.</p><p>There&#39;s more, I&#39;m sure, and I&#39;m not even counting all of the aggregators and refeeders and etc etc that replicated stuff I wrote without me asking to or having any control over the presentation.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a> is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&#0160; It&#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.</p><p>Priority one is a book purge; I&#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house.</p><p>Priority two is an internet purge, looking at the online services that absorb time (and money some times) and seeing which ones I can do without.&#0160; This means that every single email that comes into the inbox for the next few days gets the query &quot;how do I get rid of this&quot;.</p><p>Properly done, this is a year round effort, the sort of effort that has a box in your house that is the designated spot to send things off to the Reuse Center or some other organized recycling process.&#0160; With two kids around the house the natural tendency is towards unmitigated clutter, but there&#39;s some way to counteract that.</p>

the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) offers one-stop
business assistance. Our business development managers work with
consultants, utilities, associations and local economic development
agencies to best match businesses&#39; needs with Michigan&#39;s opportunities.
From attractive financing through our $2 billion&#0160;21st Century Jobs Fund
to&#0160;<a href="http://www.themedc.org/redir.ashx?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michiganadvantage.org%2FMIAdvantage%2FTaxes-and-Incentives%2FDefault.aspx&amp;from=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themedc.org%2FDefault.aspx">significant and long-term tax abatements</a>,
few places can offer a more attractive financial package. The MEDC is
also the channel for continuous improvement of the state&#39;s business
climate.<br /></div><p><br />One of the things they are doing is running commercials in an &quot;Upper Hand&quot; program around the country <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6553065">(via WJRT, ABC 12)</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
The Michigan Economic Development Corporation says state businesses are
stars of nationwide commercials to convince companies that Michigan is
the place for growing industry. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cascade

playing across the country, urging corporations to bring their business
to Michigan.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Millions have been invested by the MEDC in the
&quot;Upper Hand&quot; campaign. The MEDC&#39;s Lisa Dancsok says if you
commercialize it, they will come.</p><p>I haven&#39;t seen any of these &quot;Upper Hand&quot; commercials (and if you think carefully about it, the lower peninsula is the lower hand, and the UP is the upper hand, in any reasonable depiction of Michigan).</p>
