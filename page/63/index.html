<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&#39;re concerned too.</p><p>The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.&#0160; Here&#39;s something like a narrative.</p><p>In the 1969, Jimmy Dean opened a sausage factory in Plainview, TX.&#0160; It closed in 1974, sat idle for 30 years, and then was reopened as a peanut processing plant in 2004.&#0160;&#0160; The best local source for news coverage is the <a href="http://www.myplainview.com/">Plainview Daily Herald</a>, and these clippings are from their online site.</p><p>From the Plainview Daily Herald, 4/15/2004:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jim Booher, who has been involved in food processing for 20 years, is working on opening his third plant and is highly complimentary of the cooperation he´s received here as manager of the Peanut Corporation of America plant. <br /><br />Renovation work is under way on the old Jimmy Dean Meat Co. plant on <br />the west service road of North I-27, adjacent to United Parcel Service. <br />The community landed PCA in December, offering an incentive package <br />which included $390,000 over 10 years with the Plainview-Hale County <br />Industrial Foundation, the City of Plainview and Hale County each <br />putting up $13,000 a year. In-kind work by each entity will be done as <br />well. The package does not include tax abatement. <br /><br />High Plains Millwright of Plainview is handling the demolition work, <br />tearing down some walls, taking out concrete tiers and doing other <br />work before renovation begins. A metal building will be erected on an <br />existing concrete slab and will be connected to the main building. <br />“We hope to be open sometime in August or September, depending on <br />when we get our equipment installed,” said Booher, who is moving here <br />from Grand Prairie.<br /></div><p><br />KCBD, Ch. 11, has a similar story from 4/21/04:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Plainview Peanut Plant to Open this Summer <br />Peanut production in West Texas is growing and <br />that&#39;s why local farmers are excited about the <br />new plant. The plant is undergoing a facelift to <br />make way for 80,000 square feet of peanut <br />processing machinery. &quot;We&#39;re looking at <br />probably within the next three months of <br />putting equipment in and painting and getting <br />ready for operation,&quot; says plant manager, Jim <br />Booher. <br /></div><p><br />The cached copy of the PCA site (since removed) has this to say about the Texas plant:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re Ready NOW, not later! <br />Beginning with the first load of <br />peanuts ever processed at Peanut <br />Corporation&#39;s new Texas plant, our <br />most&#0160; important&#0160; task has been <br />quality.&#0160; We don&#39;t&#0160; request&#0160; your <br />patience while we figure out how to <br />do this. <br />Instead, we request that you hold us <br />to the high standards you&#39;ve always <br />expected from a Peanut Corporation <br />of America plant. We&#39;re ready.&#0160; <br />Pride in Our Newest Plant. Pride in Texas! <br />There couldn&#39;t be a more perfect location than Plainview, <br />Texas for the newest addition to Peanut Corporation&#39;s list of <br />plants! Just off North Interstate 27 in Plainview, we connect <br />the Western and Central&#0160; United States with the Texas <br />Peanut Industry. Texas really is the best state, y&#39;all! <br />&#0160;<br />Blanchers <br />Product Listing <br />Coming soon to this spot: a comprehensive <br />listing of products and services brought to <br />you by Peanut Corporation of America in <br />Plainview, Texas. <br />Until the list is posted, please feel free to <br />contact Jim Booher, our Texas plant&#39;s <br />operations manager for a complete discussion <br />of how we can serve you. <br /></div><p><br />How did Plainview get the plant?&#0160; More from the Daily Herald, Feb 25 2007:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One day,&#0160;Peanut Corporation of America President Stewart Parnell
from Lynchburg, Va., flew&#0160;in for fuel and a visit and happened to
mention that&#0160;he was looking to locate a peanut processing plant in this
area, and Miller directed him to Hale County State Bank President Brian
Pohlmeier, who&#0160;was on the board of the Plainview-Hale County&#0160;Industrial
Board.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">“As it turned out,” said Miller, “Brian had
been&#0160;Parnell’s&#0160;loan officer&#0160;for several of the planes he had bought and
it wound up with the peanut plant locating in the old Jimmy Dean plant.”</p><p>The Sept 1, 2008 Daily Herald has a brief story about the rehab of the plant:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The IDC has issued millions of dollars in revenue bonds to help
businesses in the area, including three bonds in Hale County and four
in Castro County — mainly for dairies, IDC legal representative Malcolm
Tisdel said.</span></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The city and county work hand-in-hand with the IDC and Plainview/Hale County Industrial Foundation to bring in new industry.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Jesus
Garrocho, operations manager at Peanut Corporation of America, said the
IDC was instrumental in bringing the company to Plainview.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>“The
(Peanut Corp.) facility had been empty for 30 years,” Brian Pohlmeier,
president of the IDC, said. “Now it has a business that employees
30-some people.”</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Together, the Industrial Foundation and IDC
have contributed substantial economic impact to the area. The IDC helps
not only Hale County but surrounding counties as well.</span></div><p><br />There&#39;s more from the 10/29/2003 Daily Herald:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The inducement package being offered Peanut Corp. calls for the
city, county and Plainview-Hale County Industrial Foundation to
contribute $100,000 each in $10,000 increments over a 10-year span. It
also calls for paving the parking lot of the plant and installing a
special water line for firefighting purposes.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The county approved the proposal Monday and the industrial foundation board was expected to do so today.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
In return for the incentives, the plant ­ which will process shelled
and cleaned peanuts into candy and food products ­ is expected to hire
an initial batch of 35 employees, process 256,000 pounds of nuts daily
and ultimately invest $1 million in the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> “If they pull
out, we don´t pay the ($10,000) installments,” industrial foundation
Executive Director Grady Elder said in outlining the proposal at
Monday´s Commissioners Court meeting.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The plant closed in 1974. The building is owned by Ronald Thompson of Lubbock. </p><p>I don&#39;t know what a sausage factory that has been idle for 30 years looks like, and how much it takes to rehab it to the point where it&#39;s ready to clean peanuts for use in candy.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/">Mark Forster has a new productivity system which he calls Autofocus.&#0160;</a> There&#39;s the obligatory blog, video, twitter account, glowing Lifehacker review etc etc.&#0160; If you care, you&#39;ll look them up.</p><p>Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&#39;re working on.&#0160; Rather that giving tasks tags, categories, priorities, precedence, importance, geographic location, or anything else, you simply step through your list one page at a time.&#0160; To decide what to do next you contemplate all of the unsolved tasks on that page, and when one of them jumps out at you, you do it.</p><p>The page at a time approach ensures that you don&#39;t spend all your time in contemplation and that there&#39;s a finite and shrinking list of things to contemplate.&#0160; The lack of explicit sorting means that you can engage in constructive procrastination to do something that needs to be done without feeling bad that the thing that has to be done is delayed.&#0160; And the lack of tags etc. means that the cognitive overhead of keeping track of how you make a decision goes away - you just pick something and do it.</p><p>(One more piece of this that I haven&#39;t done yet is the algorithm for deciding what not to do; apparently if you look at a page and nothing jumps out at you, you are to cross off everything on the page and not do them.&#0160; And doing something partially is OK, you mark it off on the old page and re-enter it on the new page.)</p><p>I have a weakness for new systems, if only because learning a new system means that you apply a new filter to the same old things that have been postponed for too long and you get a new way to handle a burst of attention.&#0160; This one works well on paper and works with the reporter-style pocket notebook I&#39;m using.&#0160; </p><p>I&#39;ve used similar approaches before to exploring big problem sets - if you divide the whole set into small and manageable pieces, and do something useful with each of those pieces, then you can get through a lot without trying to optimize every decision.&#0160; It works, for instance, as the strategy for picking out some new books to read from a library new bookshelf, just go one shelf at a time and pick something that catches your eye from each shelf.&#0160; You can get through a lot that way - it won&#39;t be everything, and it won&#39;t be exhaustive, but the throughput in a system where lots of decisions are easy and lots of alternatives are exposed can be good.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ruth is writing about the Ann Arbor Public Schools in a new blog <a href="http://a2schoolsmuse.blogspot.com/">Ann Arbor Schools Musings. </a></p><p><a href="http://a2schoolsmuse.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-im-writing-about-schools.html">Her introductory post spells out the reasons for blogging about school:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes I find the schools satisfactory, and sometimes not, but in general I have a lot of questions. Questions about <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> things run the way they do. <span style="font-style: italic;">Questions</span> about whether things could run better. <span style="font-style: italic;">Critiques</span> about the schools. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ideas</span>
to improve them. And--in general--I believe that most of the staff
wants the schools to work. But for whom? Are we teaching to the masses?
To the top 10%? The bottom 10%? And are we succeeding? Anyway, what
does it mean to succeed?<br /><br />In addition, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ann Arbor News</span> shrinks its coverage of everything (except maybe sports--which are important too), <span style="font-weight: bold;">we are not getting the news we need about the schools</span>. I believe that <span style="font-weight: bold;">these are our schools</span>--yes,
the taxpayers--and we need to know what is going on. These are our
schools--yes, the parents--and we need to be able to make decisions for
our kids. These are our schools--yes, the staff--who often don&#39;t have a
voice in decisions. These are our schools--yes, the students--and what
students think also matters.<br /></div><p><br />The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/boe_home">Ann Arbor Public Schools are run by an elected Board of Education; their web site</a> has some information about how that public body operates.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.0809/home">board calendar</a> for 2008-2009 has a schedule of public meetings, and includes links to the packets of information that have been assembled for the board to review for each meeting.&#0160; You may find them dry reading; you may find them hard to get through; you might find them slow to download, because the one I picked up with 64 pages and 4.4 megabytes, mostly of newspaper clippings from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; If you have comments, there are <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/rules_for_public_commentary">rules for public commentary at the board meetings</a>, which appear to be well elaborated to deal with any number of issues that arise.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The days of quickly flashing your MCard to ride an Ann Arbor bus will soon be gone.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To cut down on the use of expired MCards, the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority will require all pass holders, including
current yellow MCard holders, to swipe their cards through an updated
fare box on all fixed route buses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The change will take effect Feb. 16.</p><p>Note that any delays on boarding will affect on-time performance of routes that serve the University.&#0160; Some of those buses run very full at peak hours, and so you should watch for indicators of worse on-time performance for those routes when lots of U of Michigan passengers get on and off.</p><p>As a point of contrast, the U of Michigan buses don&#39;t require any ID or fares when boarding; their cost per bus-hour is in the $55/hr range, compared with AATA&#39;s $100/hr or so.&#0160; Those are not apples to apples comparisons, but certainly the faster you can board a bus full the less bus-hours you spend waiting at the curb and the more bus-hours you can spend getting from place to place.</p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor Transportation Authority has a system to let you check where the bus is by going to a web page; it&#39;s called <a href="http://mobile.theride.org/">Mobile Ridetrak.</a>&#0160; I&#39;ve written about it before, both <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/the-bus-game-why-its-important-to-get-the-aatas-mobile-ridetrak-back-online.html">when it has not been working</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/11/the-holy-grail-for-mobile-social-networks/#comment-1613408">when it has been working</a>.</p><p>The current Mobile Ridetrak is available only by a web page, which puts it out of reach for most mobile phones that don&#39;t have a web browser.&#0160; The AATA does not directly support SMS access, but a demonstration application has been put together to show how it might work; if you text &#39;AATABUS 5&#39; to the shortcode 41411 you&#39;ll get the demo.&#0160; Note that if there&#39;s more than 140 characters worth of text on the status page you&#39;ll get a partial listing; one thing you&#39;d need to address to put this into production would be a more compact status message of bus location.</p><p>e.g., instead of a 75 character status message for each bus like</p><p>436 to Ann Arbor On time<br />@ Ypsilanti Transit Center<br />Congress &amp; Hewitt 10:08</p><p>you&#39;d want to compress that down to as few as 29 characters like</p><p>To ARB Congress/Hewitt 10:08 </p><p>which might just let you fit all of the information about both inbound and outbound buses on a route into a single concise 140 character update.&#0160; </p><p>This application was built on <a href="http://www.textmarks.com">Textmarks</a> and was announced on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> list by Dug Song, who encouraged people who are interested in transit info to join in the <a href="http://a2geeks.org/display/geek/SuperHathawayDevHouse">SuperHathawayDevHouse</a> next meeting </p><h1><a href="http://a2geeks.org/display/geek/SuperHathawayDevHouse+2" title="SuperHathawayDevHouse 2">on Wednesday, February 18, 2009, 6 - 11 PM</a></h1><p><br />rsvp required!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>this post on &quot;<a href="http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/">how twitter was born</a>&quot; is making the rounds; thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/pzriddle">Prentiss Riddle</a> for alerting me to it.&#0160;&#0160; The best quote from it is the use case that involves the worst possible internet device in the world: text messages from a mobile phone.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">I remember that @Jack’s first use case was city-related: telling people that the club he’s at is <em>happening</em>.
“I want to have a dispatch service that connects us on our phones using
text.” His idea was to make it so simple that you don’t even think
about what you’re doing, you just type something and send it. Typing
something on your phone in those days meant you were probably messing
with T9 text input, unless you were sporting a relatively rare
smartphone. Even so, everyone in our group got the idea instantly and
wanted it.</p><p>As a point of comparison, here&#39;s<a href="http://yourtech.typepad.com/main/2007/04/from_the_archiv.html"> part of the origin story for Gopher</a>, the early 1990s internet system:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Full-text searching was like a new thing under the sun five years ago,&quot; notes McCahill.&#0160; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The
two, with assistance from the newly formed Gopher Team, fine-tuned the
prototype as music from Nirvana and Mudhoney blared in the background. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;It
was a fun time,&quot; recalls team member Torrey. &quot;It was a lot of late
nights and weekends and a lot of beer, pizza and speed metal.&quot; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Eventually, the team needed some files to dump into their baby Gopher so they could demonstrate its text-searching capability.&#0160; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We
took the Usenet (the Internet&#39;s newsgroup system) cookbook and put that
into it,&quot; says McCahill. &quot;That was the first thing - so first the
Gopher was serving recipes up. We figured everybody ate, and it was a
good way of illustrating what full-text searching could do.&quot; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If
you were looking for recipes with eggplant, you simply typed in the
word and the application would locate every eggplant reference - a
dazzling capability in 1991. </p><p>nothing quite like having a real use for the system you build while building it.</p>

      <p>There are active volcanoes in Alaska, especially now including Mt.

Redoubt is in the Cook Inlet part of Alaska, near Anchorage. This map shows distances and links to the AVO&#39;s pages on the various volcanoes in this area. <a href="http://www.avo.alaska.edu/volcanoes/volcinfo.php?volcname=Redoubt">Mt. Redoubt</a> is also historically known as Ujakushatsch, Viesokaia, Goreloi, Mirando, Redoubt Volcano, Redoubt, Mt., Yjakushatsch, Burnt Mtn., Goryalaya, Redoute Mtn. and Redutskaya, Sopka.

<p>
The Smithsonian has a collection of satellite imagery from volcanoes around the world. Here are their <a href="http://ava.jpl.nasa.gov/volcano.asp?vnum=1103-03-">satellite photos of Mt. Redoubt from the ASTER Volcano Archive.</a>  These will load into Google Earth as KML files as well.

<strong>Ice Storm Update</strong> - updated 9 p.m., January 28</p> 
<p>A significant winter storm is currently affecting our service area.<br /><br />

As of 9 p.m., 100,000 LG&amp;E customers are without power. KU has 175,000 customers without power throughout the state.<br /><br />

</p><ul>
<li>Overall, 5,800 wires are down, up about a thousand more than what were down as a result of the September 2008 wind storm.</li>
<li>We
are pulling resources from the southern states of Georgia (1,100
workers), Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina, as well as some
from Michigan to assist with the restoration.</li>
<li>Estimating 7 to 10 days before full restoration will occur in LG&amp;E&#39;s service area.</li>
<li>Statewide, full restoration may take up to two weeks.</li>
<li>The
potential exists for additional outages as the weight of snow and ice
can be enough to snap or bend tree limbs, causing them to bring down
power lines disrupting electrical service. In severe ice storms, the
weight of large accumulations of ice on power lines themselves can
cause the lines to fall without the involvement of trees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>From President Obama in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/FreedomofInformationAct/" target="_blank">memo to the heads of federal agencies</a>:
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires
transparency.&#0160; As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants.”&#0160; In our democracy, the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through
transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national
commitment to ensuring an open Government.&#0160; At the heart of that
commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the
Government and the citizenry alike.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a
clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.&#0160; The
Government should not keep information confidential merely because
public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and
failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract
fears.&#0160; Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the
personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they
are supposed to serve.&#0160; In responding to requests under the FOIA,
executive branch agencies (agencies) should act promptly and in a
spirit of cooperation, recognizing that such agencies are servants of
the public.</em></p>

Ill., January 26, 2008 – Starting today, legal educators will have the
capability to search, make use of, and share more legal educational
materials than ever before. The Center for Computer-Assisted Legal
Instruction (“<a href="http://cali.org">CALI</a>”), in collaboration with Harvard’s Berkman Center
for Internet and Society, is launching an open, searchable collection
of resources designed specifically for use in legal education: a “Legal
Education Commons” (“<a href="http://www.cali.org/lec">LEC</a>”). </span><strong><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">“All
teachers of law have materials and notes they use in teaching,” says
John Mayer, CALI Executive Director. “Many freely share their materials
with colleagues, but there has never been a singular searchable,
taggable space to serve that function for the entire legal academy,” he
explains, “until now.” The LEC is available online at www.cali.org/lec.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">FINDING TEACHING MATERIALS IN LEC<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">The
Legal Education Commons launches with over 700,000 federal court
decisions readily available to its users. This initial collection of
cases from public.resource.org makes the LEC one of the largest
gatherings of case law freely available in one place under a creative
commons license. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">CALI
has also donated 300 original illustrations from its popular online
tutorials, “CALI Lessons,” making the Legal Education Commons the first
and largest pool of free images designed specifically for use in legal
education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the LEC opens with an extensive collection of court cases and images,
it can expand its collection of resources only through contributions

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">CALI
implores faculty and staff at CALI member schools to share any files
from personal collections that may facilitate learning amongst the
legal education community. “Especially as we increasingly garner more
participation and sharing from legal educators,” says Mr. Mayer, “the
Legal Education Commons will be a great, non-commercial tool for those
who are both teaching and learning the law.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">Faculty

      <p>One of my very favorite weblogs from Michigan Tech is the aptly named <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">Backyard Arthropod Project: A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>, which is written in a style that a professional metallurgist and amateur entomologist can do.&#0160; It&#39;s hosted on somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com .</p><p>This week&#39;s post is a very lovely photo set of a Canadian Tiger Swallowtail butterfly.&#0160; The account of the identification of the <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/7367"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Papilio canadensis</span></a> is accompanied by a story of how it was collected, footnoted of course, with this note about the use of the word &quot;snarge&quot;:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">[2] I just heard this word on the news recently, as a direct result
of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,602092,00.html">the airliner that had to ditch in the Hudson river when its engines
both quit, possibly due to birds getting sucked into them</a>. It seems
that, when birds hit aircraft, the FAA always wants to know what <em>kind</em>
of bird it was, so that they can figure out their habits and try to
work out how to keep them away from the planes. So, they send any
remains that they find stuck to the plane afterwards to the <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/highlight/feathers/">Smithsonian
Institution’s Feather Identification Laboratory</a>, who figure out what it
was when it was alive. The technical term for these remains is
“snarge”. Technically, I suppose it is limited to what you get when
birds collide with aircraft, but I think it is legitimate to generalise
it to “remains of any animal after colliding with any vehicle”. So the
bug smears on your windshield, and the moths in your radiator, are all
snarge.</p><p>When my stepdad used to collect recently deceased animals to have his students check for parasites for his biology classes at Northern Michigan University, we called it roadkill; I guess snarge is a fancy federal name for airborne roadkill.</p><p>The <a href="http://wildlife-mitigation.tc.faa.gov/public_html/index.html">FAA Airport Wildlife Hazard
Mitigation Home Page</a> has much much more information on this topic, including a searchable database of bird strikes and lots of detailed data. </p>
