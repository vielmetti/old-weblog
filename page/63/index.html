<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

weather radar deployed near 45 of the larger airports in the U.S. The
radars were developed and deployed by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) beginning in 1994, as a response to several
disastrous jetliner crashes in the 1970s and 1980s caused by strong
thunderstorm winds. The crashes occurred because of wind shear--a
sudden change in wind speed and direction. Wind shear is common in
thunderstorms, due to a downward rush of air called a microburst or
downburst. The TDWRs can detect such dangerous wind shear conditions,
and have been instrumental in enhancing aviation safety in the U.S.
over the past 15 years. The TDWRs also measure the same quantities as
our familiar network of 148 NEXRAD WSR-88D Doppler
radars--precipitation intensity, winds, rainfall rate, echo tops, etc.
However, the newer Terminal Doppler Weather Radars are higher
resolution, and can &quot;see&quot; details in much finer detail close to the
radar.</p><p>something new to watch as the storms roll in.</p><p></p>

It is difficult to imagine a world without the car, and yet that is
exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new
book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces
around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new
transport system sometime in the next few decades. Specifically, the
book examines how several major processes are shaping the future of how
we travel, including:<br />• Global warming and its many global consequences<br />• Peaking of oil supplies<br />• Increased digitisation of many aspects of economic and social life<br />• Massive global population increases<br />The
authors look at changes in technology, policy, economy and society, and
make a convincing argument for a future where, by necessity, the
present car system will be re-designed and re-engineered. </p><p>Yet
the book also suggests that there are some hugely bleak dilemmas facing
the twenty first century. The authors lay out what they consider to be
possible &#39;post-car&#39; future scenarios. These they describe as &#39;local
sustainability&#39;, &#39;regional warlordism&#39; and &#39;digital networks of
control&#39;. </p><p><em>After The Car</em> will be of great interest to
planners, policy makers, social scientists, futurologists, those
working in industry, as well as general readers.</p><p>Some have
described the 20th Century as the century of the car. Now that century
has come to a close - and things are about to change. </p>

                &quot;Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes&quot;</p><p>
            
Pocket ore docks are monumental structures used to transfer iron ore
from railway cars traveling from nearby mines to ships that carry the
ore to steelmaking centers or transfer points on the Lower Great Lakes.
These structures were constructed from wood, steel, or reinforced
concrete. The twelve pocket docks that remain today are approximately
80 feet in height, 60 feet in width, and range between 900 to 2400 feet
in length. Movable steel chutes project out over the water at a slight
angle from the sides of the docks. The hinged chutes, which when
lowered allow ore to drop into ships from storage bins in the dock, are
located at twelve-foot intervals over the length of the dock and lend a
sense of scale to these massive structures</p><p>
This work will present a survey of the various types of the
gravity-operated pocket docks, from the first wooden dock of 1857 in
Marquette, Michigan to the latest concrete dock of 1944 in Thunder Bay,
Ontario. The work will also present a brief look at the more recent
conveyor-operated shiploading facilities built since 1956. A
description of how pocket docks work and a brief history of the ore
dock on the Great Lakes will be presented. Comparative drawings of
wooden, steel, and concrete docks and shiploaders will be shown. A
photographic survey of the existing docks on the Lakes will be
presented, highlighting current conditions, structural alterations,
removal of components, and threats to their future existence.</p>

During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the
great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering
capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of
their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of
the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe
Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the
Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music
community even this crumbling shard of Verde&#39;s never-performed
Il Internetto.<br /></p>

<p>I have an index card stuck in my copy of Anne Lamott&rsquo;s Bird By
Bird. In that essay, she exhorts the reader to write down
the ideas and thoughts and clever lines of dialog and whatever else
they want to remember on a handy index card (carry one, folded, in
your back pocket so you don&rsquo;t look bulky). I just reread
it out loud to myself, and now I kick myself for not having recorded
myself to listen to it again (not for you all mind you, just for
me).</p>

<p>Bird By Bird is one of my favorite books about writing, and it turns out that it reads really well too - marvelous.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t carry index cards with me all the time - for a while I did,
and now I&rsquo;ve stopped, more or less. That should be fixable,
and the completely inexcusable case where I don&rsquo;t even have a
pen with me is fixable too.</p>

<p>The digital equivalents I have for them are either pages in my
personal wiki (again, not for you, just for me) or posts like this
one in whichever blog seems the most relevant. In
both cases the Socialtext and Typepad support for Blackberry devices
are key to having some reasonable web-based system that&rsquo;s always
available especially when I&#39;m on the bus.</p>

<p>The most fun I&#39;ve seen with index cards as a system has to be

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m doing the shopping these days - a farmer&#39;s market and food coop run on Saturdays, and a Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#39;s run on Sundays.&#0160; Usually I have one or the other of the boys with me, and often there&#39;s some amount of hurry to get the whole process done.</p><p>I&#39;m not used to doing grocery shopping, but going with the boys helps since they have been doing it all along.</p><p>Here&#39;s some ways I seem to manage to get through four shopping experiences a week even though I have famously low shopping tolerance.</p><p>0.&#0160; Work from a list, always.&#0160; Take inventory of your perishables before you buy more perishables; take inventory of your pantry before you refill the pantry.&#0160; We keep a list by the fridge so that when something gets used up that should stay in stock it gets added to for the next round.</p><p>1.&#0160; Shop at farmer&#39;s market first.&#0160; You don&#39;t know what will be a super deal, and what will be in season, and what oddly shaped root vegetable will catch your eye with a farmer who will tell you how to cook it.&#0160; So do that part of the week&#39;s shopping first, and work around it as you do your menu plan.&#0160; </p><p>2.&#0160; Always take the same route through the farmer&#39;s market.&#0160; Mostly the farmers are in the same stalls week after week, or if they move one week they will stay put the next.&#0160; I know where to get onions, garlic, eggs, apples, greens, and herbs, and which places I need to check out but not buy at right away because someone might have a better deal.</p><p>3.&#0160; Do a weekly menu plan, synchronized around your shopping week.&#0160; In our case the farmer&#39;s market is on Saturday and the menu plan gets made on Sunday morning while we eat pancakes, and so we have a good idea of what produce we&#39;re working with and enough time to get all of the supplemental produce and pantry staples on a Sunday shopping to make a week&#39;s worth of meal plans.</p><p>4.&#0160;&#0160; Make a list of menu suggestions.&#0160; Keep track of meals that you&#39;ve made and liked, and don&#39;t be afraid to repeat yourself at appropriate intervals or in appropriate seasons.&#0160; When it comes time to plan a week&#39;s meals, you don&#39;t want to start with a blank piece of paper; I find that the two weeks ago menu generally has one or two good ideas for this week for things you aren&#39;t sick of.</p><p>5.&#0160;&#0160; Always take the same route through the store, and organize your shopping list according to the store layout.&#0160; That means for our Whole Foods that the order goes vegetables, bulk foods, canned goods, cheese, bread, while at Trader Joes the order is bread, cheese, yogurt, frozen veg, canned goods, snacks.&#0160; You should be able to walk through the store without backtracking to pick up everything you need.</p><p>6.&#0160; Put away your food in the same place every time.&#0160; This might sound silly, but if you keep the beans on the left and the tomatoes on the right always then you can always inventory your tomatoes and know how much you need to buy.&#0160; Randomness is not your friend in the pantry.</p><p>7.&#0160; Get home delivery of as many heavy things as you can.&#0160; We get enough milk to feed two growing boys delivered weekly, and that cuts 25 pounds of weight off the grocery cart.</p><p>A few notes.&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you get most of this process from someone who used to do it all the time and got good at it, even with little kids in tow; left to my own devices I&#39;m much more random.&#0160; Two good mottos to follow are &quot;every meal accounted for&quot; and &quot;no backtracking&quot;.&#0160; The only flaw in my design is the no alcohol before Sunday noon Michigan law, which makes buying beer and wine an exception rather than a regular easy to follow process.&#0160;&#0160; It&#39;s easier to do this if you&#39;re vegetarian and have a big recipe list built up over the years and enough spices in your spice cabinet to get variety from variations on a theme.&#0160; And I still don&#39;t have a middle eastern or Korean grocery in my regular routine, which by rights should happen about 1x/mo each.</p>

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN LARGE SOCIAL AND INFORMATION NETWORKS<br />
Michael W. Mahoney<br />
Stanford University</p><p>
The concept of a community is central to social network analysis, and
thus a large body of work has been devoted to identifying community
structure. For example, a community may be thought of as a set of web
pages on related topics, a set of people who share common interests, or
more generally as a set of nodes in a network more similar amongst
themselves than with the remainder of the network. &#0160;Motivated by
difficulties we experienced at actually finding meaningful communities
in large real-world networks, we have performed a large scale analysis
of a wide range of social and information networks. &#0160;Our main
methodology uses local spectral methods and involves computing
isoperimetric properties of the networks at various size scales -- a
novel application of ideas from scientific computation to internet data
analysis. Our empirical results suggest a significantly more refined
picture of community structure than has been appreciated previously.
Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network dataset we
examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities at very small
size scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible communities
gradually ``blend in&#39;&#39; with the rest of the network and thus become
less ``community-like.&#39;&#39; This behavior is not explained, even at a
qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation
models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one
would expect based on experience with and intuition from expander
graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional
structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds
of community detection algorithms. Possible mechanisms for reproducing
our empirical observations will be discussed, as will implications of
these findings for clustering, classification, and more general data
analysis in modern large social and information networks.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In recent days a number of modestly successful online social and productivity services have been scheduled for decommisioning.  Pownce is being turned off as that team moves to Six Apart, and I Want Sandy is going away as Rael moves to Twitter. You will see more systems get acquired and shut down with graceful exits, and some exits will not be so graceful.</p>

<p>There seem to be multiple common reasons why upstart systems get wiped out in times of economic crisis.  If your traffic is not growing and you aren't attracting legions of superstar users, it starts to look expensive to bet against a bigger rival.  Even if you do manage to pull off steady growth in usage the test may be scaling up your infrastructure to keep pace with demand.</p>

<p>If the dot com crash is any predictor of future consolidation, look for the survival of systems that address some specific real need of some narrow niche and that don't have to grow to planetary size to be profitable.  Display advertising rates continue to fall, making it more and more attractive for people to run house ads instead selling merchandise or services directly to whatever audience they can sustain.  If what you are using does more than just scratch some coder's itch you have a better chance.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 is over.  Back up your important data now, or decide which parts of it you are willing to discard.</p>

general manager, WDIV-TV, Detroit; and Vincent Duffy, news director,
Michigan Public Radio. Gil Klein, a veteran national correspondent,
former National Press Club president, and director of the club&#39;s
Centennial Forums program, will moderate. Library Director Elaine
Didier commented that &quot;President Ford had such a wonderful history with
the National Press Club, it seemed only fitting that we would host the
forum in Ann Arbor at his Presidential Library.&quot; The event will begin
with a preview of the club&#39;s centennial documentary, &quot;The National
Press Club: A Century of Headlines,&quot; which follows the history of
American journalism through the lens of one of its leading
institutions. Everyone who attends this free forum will get a copy of
the documentary. The preview will be followed by a short presentation
by Richard Ryan, a longtime &quot;Detroit News&quot; Washington correspondent and
past club president, about the relationship between Ford and the news
media. This forum is part of a nationwide conversation the National
Press Club is holding during its 100th anniversary to look at where the
news business is going and what news consumers should be demanding. The
NPC Centennial Forums program is sponsored by Aviva USA. For
information, call (734) 205-0567.

      </h3>
      <p>It&rsquo;s winter, your hands see cold so you are wearing gloves, but you need at least a few fingers free for your mobile phone.  What designs work?</p>

<p>The gloves I am wearing now have a flap to expose a sort of fingerless Mitten, and if I fold things right I can expose just two index fingers.  I could imagine thumbs free gloves too.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m writing this from my mobile phone, using typepad mobile to post with. As a blog post interface it works pretty well.
</p><p>
There is one key piece that is missing to make it more helpful: a search function. I don&#39;t see a way to easily search through my past posts from the phone to go back and update and edit one of them. It is easy to get to the last 5 posts but the next option is to list all 1900 entries, no thanks.
</p><p>
As a small corollary to that, I don&#39;t see an easy way to add a comment to a post either; in some cases a comment is better that an edit.
</p><p>
Look for more posts from the bus.
</p><p>
NOTES afterward:
</p><p>
The default edit mode is HTML, which explains why the first iteration of this post didn&#39;t have paragraph breaks. Fixed in post-production.
</p><p>
The application I actually used was the <a href="http://i.typepad.com/">web-based iPhone Typepad interface</a>, which works fine on the Blackberry. There is a <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-blackberry.html">Blackberry native interface</a> which I haven&#39;t tried yet.</p>
