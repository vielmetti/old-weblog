      </h3>
      <p>February 5, 2014: More than 623,000 customers were without power in the service area covered by PECO (Philadelphia, PA area) at the peak of an ice storm on Wednesday. This is the second worst storm that the company has reported, right behind Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Peco-outage-map-feb-5-2014" title="Peco-outage-map-feb-5-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.peco.com/CustomerService/OutageCenter/OutageMap/Pages/OutageMap.aspx">PECO power outage map</a> does not go into lots of detail on the map, but it does list individual communities and their outage status in county by county detail pages. Emily Babay from Philly.com graphed the outages as they increased over the span of the morning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gov. Tom Corbett said at a noon press conference that utility crews from out of state would be called in to help with the wide-spread outages. He said as Pennsylvania energy companies had received some 750,000 calls so far, but his office had yet to declare a state of emergency.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Does email work anymore as a way to connect people who share the same interests, in the old-school Internet sense of the community that forms around a well-managed, well-moderated mailing list? I'm starting to think after having my inbox fill up with well-intentioned communications that the era of the mailing list is over, and with it the era of any other use for email except the purely transactional.</p>

<p>My email messages are relatively long (compared to IMs or tweets), relatively formal, and carefully composed. A single message will sit in my inbox for more than 24 hours before I feel ready to give it its due. In a world of instant messaging that looks more and more like an anachronism, as though I were pulling out a quill pen to communicate with when everyone else was merrily texting away.</p>

<p>I run some long-running mailing lists, and I've started to itch at the limitations of Yahoo Groups for community engagement and for attracting new people who don't really want their inboxes to fill up with chit-chat. There must be a better way. </p>

<p>(Ironically, I'll probably email this post out to one of those lists, and will get more comments back from the email than I will get from this blog.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I'd give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.</p>

<p>You can see it at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com">http://vielmetti.typepad.com</a>.</p>

<p>So far so good, I guess. I don't have strong preferences about it; the advantage is that more short posts fit on a page, making it easier to scroll through a lot of them. The disadvantage is that I don't know where the 40 word mark is, and there's no really obvious way to say "always excerpt the lead paragraph", which is what I want.</p>

<p>Fiddling with your blog is the traditional way not to write. If I had to fiddle more, I'd look for a design that worked better on mobile devices like my Android phone; the current design has a weird choice of fonts for blog title that comes out too small, and my CSS-fu is not adequate to the task of debugging and fixing it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/atlanta-snow-jam-2014-metro-commuters-recount-thei/nc5qF/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. And side streets? Even worse. Some people ditched their vehicles and set out on foot. Others tried to help stranded strangers. And many persevered, moving a few inches an hour toward home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, was set up to help stranded motorists, and it has spawned a <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zCPqWODXYzLY.kQ7WuEIEQXNs">Stranded Driver Shelter Map</a>, a clip of which is below.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Kroger, Walmart, and Home Depot have opened their stores as shelters, if you can get to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2622">Jeff Masters blog from Weather Underground</a> has the situation in detail.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dangerous winter storm swept through the Deep South on Tuesday, dumping 1 - 4" of snow and 1/4" - 1/2" of ice on a region unused to dealing with severe winter weather. Travel chaos resulted in many cities, and at least nine people died in storm-related accidents. Officially, 2.6" of snow fell at the Atlanta Airport from Winter Storm Leon, and snow amounts across the city ranged from 1.5" - 3.5". But with temperatures in the low 20s, and only 40 snow plows and 30 sand trucks to handle the snow, Atlanta streets and highways quickly turned into parking lots during the afternoon snow, as schools, businesses, and government offices all closed nearly simultaneously, sending a huge number of vehicles onto the roads. Atlanta experienced its worst traffic day of all-time, and thousands of motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles, with many spending the night sheltering in stores, stalled cars, or strangers' homes. A Facebook group dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, meant to connect stranded motorists with people willing to put them up for the night, had thousands of members by Tuesday night. Hundreds of children never made it home, and were forced to spend the night at their schools or at bus shelters. There were 940 confirmed traffic accidents in Atlanta, with more than 100 involving injuries, according to the Georgia public safety commissioner. It was Atlanta's worst driving day since the infamous Snow Jam of 1982, when 6" of snow also created traffic chaos, stranding thousands of motorists.</p>

<p>I'm rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it's easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.</p>

<p>So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945), David Sucher's "City Comforts" (2003), and <a href="http://www.mbenedikt.com/">Michael Benedikt</a>'s anthology "Cyberspace: First Steps" (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.</p>

<p>The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can't simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.</p>

<p>One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt's "Cyberspace". It's a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there's anything of common use that defines it, it's the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.</p>

<p>I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I'm stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that's true to the work? </p>

<p>One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for "vielmetti benedikt cyberspace" should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.</p>

<p>A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace">Goodreads</a> (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/31259">Librarything</a> (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20">Amazon</a>, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.</p>

<p>For every work, there's some chance that an echo of it will be online too; <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf">IEU in Turkey</a> has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.</p>

<p>What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? </p>

<p>I've carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What's more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.</p>

<hr/>

<p>noted as well:</p>

<p>An interview with Benedikt in <a href="http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;pff=1">AIGA</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.</p>

<p>I'm (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome. I wrote about it previously; it's an extension that suspends the processes of tabs you mark as inactive, so that they can be restored quickly. As a bonus, it's good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with "only" 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.</p>

<p>The Internet, in its infinite wisdom, has a lot of things competing for our attention. The only problem is that it's easy to save a tab group but as hard as ever to really mark a tab as closed. I'm sure there's some stable working set that I should keep going, but it's also satisfying to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet.html">decrease the n</a> by closing tabs.</p>

There are lots of reasons to want to use more art on this weblog. It's attractive, for one; it displays good taste to have interesting artwork to illustrate your points; and the reader who is tuned to the visual image has a lot more likelihood to appreciate a crisp image than they will a wall of text. That's all good.</p>

<p>I also am very aware that in most cases the works that I'd like to share references to are copyrighted, and in some cases (looking at you, Getty Images) the copyright holders have been aggressive in pursuing their digital rights.</p>

<p>I sigh in amazement at the companies set up to do wholesale copyright infringement, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/jklfa/jasper-johns-crosshatch/">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+image+search+jasper+johns&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_ZPkUsy9JZDaoATuzICwCQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1174&amp;bih=662#q=jasper%20johns%20numbers&amp;revid=321734900&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_">Google Image Search</a> and the like of this world that scoop up imagery wholesale and are not shy about reusing it for their own purposes. The hope is that the worst case is a DMCA takedown, and the best case is an artist who I'd ask permission of who would be thrilled to have a low resolution version of their illustration, photo, or artwork adorn this blog.</p>

<p>The artwork in question is from Jasper Johns; it's entitled 0-9 and, if the title of the image is to be believed, dates from 1958-1959. I don't know precisely which museum or collector owns this piece. If I can figure out exact credit, I'll share it. The image is used with the belief that a low resolution version of the original artwork is fair use. </p>

      <p>ABC News reports:</p>

  <p>Metro-North, the nation's second-busiest commuter railroad, was brought to a standstill for nearly two hours on Thursday night after computer problems caused signal issues system-wide, railroad officials said.</p>

  <p>The cause of the outage remained under investigation Thursday night. “We can’t say what the cause of it is. We’re still trying to figure that out,” Daniels told 1010 WINS.</p>

<p>For a good read on after-incident reporting, I always refer people to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/115136140203018391796">Postmortems</a> group on Google+ - it's an excellent source of descriptions of what happened when computers "glitch" (because they rarely glitch all by themselves).</p>

<p>The field is a lot longer - MGoBlog gives current UM Athletic Director David Brandon a 350-1 chance at getting the nod. The commenters are even less enthusiastic: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dave Brandon entering the presidency with zero academic administration experience, much less zero experience in the academy... Disaster. Dismantle the Diag, mothball the libraries, send everyone home.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a recipes collection.</p>
<p>This was part of dinner last week - yum! I don&#39;t have the exact proportions in front of me so you&#39;ll want to be prepared to improvise.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Potatoes</strong>, peeled, cut to quarters; to fill lasagna pan; redskins would do well <br />Juice of 3 <strong>lemons,&#0160;</strong><strong>fresh squeezed</strong>&#0160;juice not stuff from bottles if you have it&#0160;<br />Greek <strong>oregano </strong>(though Mexican oregano worked OK too) <br /><strong>Olive oil</strong> <br />Water</p>
<p>Preheat oven to a good roasting temperature (450+ degrees).</p>
<p>Put the potatoes in the lasagna pan. Mix lemon juice, water, oregano, oil together; you are after something like a salad dressing, but since you&#39;re baking it the water will go away, so make sure there&#39;s enough oil. Besides, olive oil is good for you.</p>
<p>Pour the dressing over the potatoes, mix until everything is coated. Put in oven. Roast until starting to turn brown, about 40-50 minutes depending on your oven and your potatoes. If you don&#39;t have a lot of oil in the dressing, you may need to turn to keep things from sticking.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll bet it would be good to put a couple of organic lemon halves in there too to roast along with everything.</p>
<p>Remove from oven, test for doneness. Eat. Yum. Also good cold.</p>
<p>Some other lemon roasted potato recipes, for comparison: <br />- <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/corby/ct2000-12.htm">Corby&#39;s Table</a> from The Atlantic Monthly has a patates riganates recipe from a review of Aglaia Kremezi&#39;s &quot;Foods of the Greek Islands&quot; <br />- <a href="http://www.sandisrecipecorner.com/recipe488H.htm">Sandi&#39;s Recipe Corner</a>, adds stock <br />- <a href="http://www.dvo.com/recipe_pages/grilln/Greek_Garlic_and_Lemon_Roasted_Potatoes.html">Cook&#39;n</a>, adds dill and roasts over wood chips <br />- <a href="http://www.autumnjade.com/recipes/133.htm">Autumn Jade</a>, basically the same with exact proportions <br />- <a href="http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2001/greek/potatoes.html">Global Gourmet</a> calls these <strong>patates riganates</strong> and adds garlic <br />- <a href="http://creampuffsinvenice.typepad.com/cream_puffs_in_venice/2006/04/some_lemony_spu.html">&quot;Cream Puffs in Venice&quot; has some lemony spuds for you</a>, adapted from <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/907079">Cook This</a> by Amy Rosen.</p>
<p>and I&#39;m sure there are more recipes to be had!</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>One more recipe to go with this if you have any cold leftovers. Put a bed of spring mixed greens on a plate; I like the Asian mix we found at Farmer&#39;s Market. Cut some of these potatoes up and put on top. Add diced cubed cold roasted beets for color and flavor. Dress with some of the lemon-oil mix, with a little red wine vinegar added. Yum.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? </p>

<p>The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner's street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so. </p>

<p>What these people wish to know, then, is, if the city owns the streets and their shade trees and side walks, why the city should not itself build the sidewalks, do all grading and plant all shade trees? </p>

<p>It is undeniable that when a man builds his sidewalk it immediately becomes city property, and he has no more ownership of it than any other citizen. In fact, in a single day hundreds will use it when he uses it once. In short, it is built not for him, but for the public. Then why should not the public pay for it? </p>

<p>The building of sidewalks under the existing ordinance is a heavy burden upon very many citizens, some of whom have been compelled by their circumstances to borrow the money at interest to enable them to comply with the order of the council. This seems to your correspondent to be a matter worthy of deliberate consideration by the city fathers. The claim of these people is that the city, owning the streets, should itself put down all sidewalks, and spread the expense upon he general tax. </p>

<p>It may do no good to open up this question at this time; but the voice of the people should at least be heard in the matter, and this communication certainly expresses it in some degree. </p>

      <p>Every once in a while, I come up with a really good idea. More often than not, I don't.</p>

<p>I'm content to work on systems that accommodate the work that leads to a steady sense of slow progress. The weblog piles one post upon another; every so often, the middle of the pile is most interesting, and you dust it off and bring it out again as if it were new. The wiki appreciates it when you fix a very small typo, change an "an" to an "a", tidy up a caption or resize a photo.</p>

<p>Progress is more often than not measured very slowly, if at all. Just try not to go backwards. </p>

<p>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It's fascinating to see people's attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.</p>

<p>What these tools don't easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. But that's a large part of the problem - the endless fascination gets in the way of applying fingers to the keyboard and creating something brand new.</p>

<p>It's easy to get distracted by the sorts of things that are meant to help you out. It's hard to be analytical and dispassionate about your past work while at the same time you're trying to create new work. Not everything worth writing has to rank highly on a search engine or get lots of referral traffic; sometimes, you just need to create something even if it's only for you to stretch your fingers. </p>

<p>I've been using a todo system <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">based on Github issues</a> for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be.</p>

<p>When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided that the only way to make progress on this list was to dramatically prune it. That means taking some items off the list that I really do want to do eventually, it's just that I'm not focusing on them now because every time I look at them on the list I say "no". Crossing them off the list doesn't completely delete them, and when I need to revisit them I can reopen the issue.</p>

<p>The list is down to 30 now, and I'm careful not to add more than that without crossing something else off the list. It still has a few lingering things that haven't been done for a long time, but I have had my teeth cleaned, and what's more I can read through the whole thing in one sitting and usually say "yes" to some next task.</p>

  <p>Grimshaw was best friends in childhood with the late MC5 singer Rob Tyner. He was also a part of revolutionary poet John Sinclair’s Rainbow People’s Party and the “Trans-Love Energies” artistic movement. Grimshaw was active from the late 60s until recently, doing new work for local appearances by The White Stripes and Patti Smith and publishing a book last summer with Leni Sinclair titled Detroit Rocks! A Pictorial History of Motor City Rock and Roll 1965 to 1975.</p>

      </h3>
      <h2>Roasted broccoli salad with rice and feta</h2>

<p>For the rice: prepare 1.5 cups rice according to your taste. Do this first.</p>

<p>For the broccoli: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut a few heads of broccoli into bite sized florets. Mix in a bowl with olive oil, then place on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle sea salt on top. Roast 12-15 minutes until the broccoli is every so slightly browned on top.</p>

<p>For the garbanzos: Drain and rinse a can of garbanzos. Put in a small pot and cover with water. Heat until hot, then rinse again under cool water.</p>

<p>For the red peppers: Cut a red pepper into pieces about the size of a garbanzo bean.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Make a lemon vinaigrette with a little mint.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Some sweet chili paste, or gochujang, or your favorite spicy sauce.</p>

<p>For the feta: crumble some feta.</p>

<p>Serve in individual bowls on the table, for people to mix their own salads. If your family is like mine, someone will eat just rice and peppers and beans, someone else will prefer the salad without feta, someone will want a vinaigrette and someone else (me) will douse the whole thing with chili sauce. Enjoy!</p>

<p>A chemical spill of crude MCHM into the Elk River near Charleston, WV on January 9, 2014 has contaminated the tap water for 300,000 customers of <a href="http://www.amwater.com/wvaw/">West Virginia American Water</a>. The chemical was stored in tanks owned by Freedom Industries. Crude MCHM (<a href="http://www.wvgazette.com/mediafiles/document/2014/01/11/Eastman-MCHM-SDS_I140111162532.PDF">MSDS, Eastman Chemical</a>) is a mixture of several chemicals, including 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol, 4-
(methoxymethyl)cyclohexanemethanol, methyl 4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate, dimethyl 1,4-
cyclohexanedicarboxylate, methanol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; it is used in the coal processing industry to produce "clean coal" that has impurities removed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dorsey has said DEP officials began an investigation after receiving odor complaints from nearby residents starting at about 8:15 a.m. The DEP and Kanawha County emergency officials traced the odors to Freedom Industries, which had not self-reported any sort of leak or accident, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>In an air-quality enforcement order, the DEP said air-quality officials who arrived at the site at 11:10 a.m. "discovered that no spill containment measures had been initiated and that an accumulating MCHM leak pool was seeping thru a dike wall adjacent to the Elk River and a downstream oil sheen was observed."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201401100078">Charleston Gazette</a> - What is 'Crude MCHM'? Few know - Ken Ward, Jr.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- As hundreds of thousands of residents in and around the Kanawha Valley struggle with the "do not use" order from West Virginia American Water Co., one stubborn fact continues to frustrate residents and some local health officials alike: No one seems to be able to say for sure what the coal-cleaning chemical that's been dumped into our water supply might do to us.</p>
  
  <p>Water company officials have identified the chemical -- which leaked from a Freedom Industries tank just upstream from the regional drinking-water intake on the Elk River -- as something called "Crude MCHM." That material is made up almost entirely of another chemical, 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol.</p>
  
  <p>Material-safety sheets from several manufacturers list little in the way of health information. Toxicological databases provide few answers.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b img-responsive" alt="Indianapolis-Power-Light-2014-01-08-outage-map" title="Indianapolis-Power-Light-2014-01-08-outage-map" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fbe3afd5970b-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>The world of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/12/lansing-michigan-lbwl-crowdsourced-power-outage-map-of-29-december-2013.html">BWL</a>, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult.</p>

<p>If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. Here too there's no one centralized resource to make that happen. What there is, however, is a very efficient system developed by a world where making that power go back on is important - the nation's utility lineman.</p>

<p>There is a company, <a href="http://linemanbarn.com/">Lineman Barn</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lineman.barn">Facebook page</a> that tracks all kinds of storm-related damage and helps people who do that work connect to each other and find work. (Lineman Barn sells logo clothing for the trade.) When a storm hits, you'll see periodic updates every 6 to 24 hours of utilities that have lines down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Established in 2003 to bring pride and recognition to the trade, Lineman Barn is the First Choice of Linemen and their families for custom shirts, hats, decals, gifts, JOBS and Lineman Safety News.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without further ado here are the outage numbers from January 6, 2014, at noon. Note that many of these utilities have maps that you can see on the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> page. 
By my count that's 150,192 lines out nationwide.</p>

<p>It's bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. </p>

<p>One of the things we're looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the <strong>emerald ash borer</strong> that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the <a href="http://thegazette.com/2014/01/07/ash-borer-larvae-in-iowa-will-survive-cold-snap-scientists-say/#sthash.ZsDtIacT.dpuf">The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa)</a> has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Minnesota, where arctic outbreaks are colder, more frequent and last longer, they do inhibit the spread of the emerald ash borer, according to Lee Frelich, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology.</p>
  
  <p>In parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota, frequent, protracted cold spells may actually establish a zone in which ash trees can survive, Frelich said....</p>
  
  <p>Citing recent research conducted in Minnesota, Frelich said 5 percent of emerald ash borer larvae die when exposed to a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The mortality rate increased to 34 percent at 10 below, to 79 percent at 20 below and 98 percent at 30 below, according to that research.</p>
  
  <p>However, the exposure must last at least several hours to overcome the insulating effect of the bark beneath which the larvae live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More details on <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/updraft/2014/01/extreme-cold-may-wipe-out-high-percentage-emerald-ash-borer-larvae/">Minnesota Public Radio News</a>, again from Frelich:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the forecast temperatures that we will experience in the next several days will cause a lot of mortality for emerald ash borer in MN. Details below–probably more than you need. I looked up the most recent research this morning, because I figured I will get a lot of questions about this over the next week.</p>
  
  <p>Winter mortality for emerald ash borer is definitely temperature dependent. The larvae can supercool to a certain point, but they die if they freeze, and there is variability in tolerance among individual insects. A recent study from the Forest Service (Venette and Abrahamson–see attached) in Minnesota showed that 5% of the insects die at 0F, 34% at -10F, 79% at -20F and 98% at -30F.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent study is <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5191794.pdf">Venette and Abrahamson, Cold Hardiness Of Emerald Ash Borer, AGRILUS PLANIPENNIS: A new perspective</a>. The abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study was designed to assess the cold hardiness of emerald ash borer larvae, the 
  overwintering stage of the insect. We began by measuring larval supercooling points, the 
  temperatures at which larvae freeze. We found that larvae collected from naturally infested trees in St. Paul, MN between late October and early December had an average supercooling point of -25°C (-13°F). Research elsewhere indicates that when these insects freeze, they die. Our laboratory assessments of cold hardiness were confirmed during field tests. Naturally infested logs were held outdoors in St. Paul, MN (low winter air temp=-28°C) and near Grand Rapids, MN (-34°C) for ca. 5.5 weeks. Approximately 40% of larvae from logs in St. Paul were inactive or brown, both evidence of death; approximately 90% of larvae from logs near Grand Rapids were inactive or brown, compared with the approximately 10% that showed evidence of death prior to exposure or after being held under cool, non-lethal conditions. Overwintering mortality 
  may help to minimize the damage caused by emerald ash borer in areas with extremely cold 
  winter climates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you go; the colder the weather, the more of the bugs die.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours).</p>

<p>I put the raw potato strips into a big bowl, pour some olive oil on them, and mix until everything is nicely coated, then put them onto cookie sheets and cook for what seems like a long time in a 425 degree F oven. If you want equally crispy on both sides, turn them over part way through. They would be good with a sprinking of sea salt.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today.html">yesterbox</a>. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done.</p>

<p>The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. Alas, things go onto this list and stay there forever. How to reconcile the two?</p>

<p>What I'm going to try, as best I can, is to deal with today's bright ideas about what I need to do but don't have time to do right now tomorrow. There will be a finite number of things to look at, and I can probably deal with some of them right away. I don't mean to kick the can down the road, but I also don't want to try to tackle everything I've ever thought of doing all at once.</p>

<p>Inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.wallofvoodoo.net/">Wall of Voodoo</a> song "Tomorrow".</p>

<p>I'll do it tomorrow / that seems like a pretty good idea to me</p>

<p>Paracorp is a professional registered agency company, so this registration doesn't give a direct clue to the owners of this entity.</p>

  <p>Ufer said he has another grocery store chain that will begin renovating the 30,000-square-foot building after Kroger vacates the property. A closing date for Kroger has not yet been determined, but Ufer said it will be sometime in 2014. The store’s lease expires Aug. 31.</p>

<p>A letter from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Yousef_Rabhi">Yousef Rabhi</a> regarding the homeless, and the response to the storm by Washtenaw County; reproduced with permission. All hyperlinks go to <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> pages, which should have more detail and explanations.</p>

<p><br/> </p>

<p>FYI: I discussed this issue with the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Snow_emergency">Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council</a> and options were discussed. County government has been mobilized to do our part to ensure that members of our community that are homeless are able to keep warm over the next few days.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> is working with <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Delonis_Center">Delonis</a> to ensure that we find space for additional individuals. From my understanding, additional capacity was made available today. Another concern that has been raised is that some members of the homeless community are not able to pass a breathalyzer test and so will not be admitted to the Delonis Warming Shelter. Due to the severity of the predicted cold, it appears that Delonis will be more lenient with this policy.  </p>

<p>The County's <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">Project Outreach Team</a> has been delivering sleeping bags, and other warming materials to individuals that are camping outside tonight. Through site visits and other methods, they have established an accounting of individuals that are sleeping outside and their needs. For those that do not have access to warming at the Delonis Center, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a> has offered accommodations to house those individuals and keep them warm.</p>

<p>Public Health is also working with their Emergency Officer to respond to public health concerns as they arise. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Washtenaw_County_Public_Health">Public Health</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/CSTS">Community Support and Treatment Services</a> and The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> have been working around the clock to ensure that folks stay warm tonight. With the cold setting in, we must remain vigilant to ensure that no one falls though the cracks. If anyone hears of any issues of people being turned away from the warming center, please contact me. We will ensure that resources are available to help those that need warmth. </p>

<p>Thank you all for your concern on this matter. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>From email sent by Ann Arbor City Council member <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Christopher_Taylor">Christopher Taylor</a> (D-3d Ward).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>Here is a quick update for you about the snow and the City’s response.</p>

<p>As of 9:00 pm, we have had 11+ inches of snow. We have not declared a formal snow emergency and street parking is unrestricted. </p>

<p>All City facilities will be open Monday and trash collection will run on its ordinary schedule. </p>

<p>Road crews are out working 12 – 14 hour shifts. The day shift had 14 trucks assigned to Major roadways until noon, then dropped down to 12 trucks to accommodate schedule changes necessary to bolster the night shift.  Our night shift began at 6pm with a regular staff of 14 trucks assigned to Majors. The Major road staff will start using sand/salt mix around midnight. Additional staff will be assigned to work on locals during the night.  Local plowing will begin with Monday and Tuesday trash collection routes, and then continue throughout the City.  </p>

<p>The Snow Desk (994-SNOW) will be staffed 7am - 11pm thru Wednesday to answer resident questions and to report concerns.</p>

<p>As ever, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Stay warm and if you must travel, drive carefully.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Christopher Taylor</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is current as of January 4, 2014. Check on the <a href="http://library.municode.com/HTML/11782/level3/TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC.html#TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC_10_143SNEM">Municode</a> web site for the absolute latest information, though it's unlikely that the ordinance will change.</p>

<p>Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a "Snow Condition Yellow". From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheCityOfAnnArbor">City of Ann Arbor Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets. Moving your car will also keep it from being plowed in with snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A snow emergency declared on Dec. 25-26, 2002, but City Council voted in Jan. 6, 2003 to waive or reduce fines from tickets issued during that event; this <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/03/02/monthly-milestone-institutional-memory/">according to the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>

<p>10:143. Snow emergencies.</p>

<p>(1)
Prohibited parking for snow removal.</p>

<p>(a)
Whenever the City Administrator finds, on the basis of snow, sleet, freezing rain, or on the basis of a weather forecast, that weather conditions make it necessary to restrict parking to allow removal of existing or forecasted snow, the Administrator may declare a snow emergency and put in effect an odd/even parking prohibition on some or all city streets by providing notice of the prohibition in the manner prescribed by this section.</p>

<p>(b)
When an odd/even parking prohibition is in effect, no person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle owned by him or her to remain parked on the following described portions of any street; provided, however, that the parking prohibition of this subsection does not apply during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that vehicles can be positioned to comply with the next day's prohibition.</p>

<p>(i)
On days having uneven dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having even street addresses.</p>

<p>(ii)
On days having even dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having uneven street addresses.</p>

<p>(2)
Notice.</p>

<p>(a)
The prohibitions provided in this section shall take effect when the Administrator causes notice of such prohibitions to be publicly announced by radio stations, Community Television Network and any other suitable media outlet with normal operating ranges covering the city. The prohibitions shall then take effect at the time provided in the announcement. The Administrator may also cause notice of the parking prohibition to be published in newspapers of general circulation when feasible.</p>

<p>(b)
The parking prohibitions provided by this section shall remain in effect until the Administrator makes a public announcement of the termination of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>(3)
Nothing contained in this section permits parking at times or places where it is otherwise prohibited by this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 48-01, § 3, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 38-02, § 1, 10-21-02; Ord. No. 2-03, § 1, 2-18-03)</p>

      <p>This simple dish of beans and greens comes from Mary Ann Esposito's <a href="http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2221/broccoli-rabe-with-white-beans">Ciao Italia</a>. It's similar in many ways to the traditional "Hoppin' John" served for good luck for the new year.</p>

<h2>Hoppin' Giovanni</h2>

<p>Wash and chop a bunch of rapini (broccoli rabe). If you can't find rapini, some other mild green like turnip greens (or even kale) would work nicely.</p>

<p>Mince a shallot fine and saute in a large pan in olive oil until fragrant. Add a few generous pinches of red pepper flakes. Put the chopped rapini into the pan and cook until the greens are cooked through.</p>

<p>Drain and rinse a can of white beans (cannellini). When the greens are cooked through, add the beans and stir. You can add a little more olive oil to the pan at this point if you want to. Stir and then bring back up to heat.</p>

<p>Serve hot. This would go good with pasta.</p>

      <p>I'm thinning out my todo list for the new year to delete some of the oldest items, the ones that aren't particularly hard but they also haven't been done this past year.</p>

<p>I figure that if I need to do them, the opportunity will arise again, and it might be easier to get them done if they show up fresh at the top of the list rather than buried at the bottom.</p>

<p>What's humorous (or sad) is the items marked "urgent" that are more than a week old; clearly, simply marking something as urgent does not stand in for actually doing the work.</p>

<p>Ah, new year's productivity !</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yup, thinning out the list is now a perpetual activity; I'm trying to keep work in progress under about 30 tasks. There may be more to do in the world, you think? I can only keep track of so much of it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy
of something I've already written and published somewhere else.
That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by
googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into
the ether too quickly (including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ourfounder/posts/10152097845036826">this thread</a> which will die quietly
when we are all done with it).</p>

<p>Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really
provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic
discussion. Rather, they bias towards the moderator's interests,
because only the posts from the moderator are visible for long
enough to get any traffic.</p>

<p>The problem of how to build forum software is old and solved. The
MTS Confer system and others that followed it like Picospan and <a href="http://www.caucus.com">Caucus</a>
lived in a world where you could create a long-running discussion
that focused on one topic and where you could keep that topic mostly
on-topic over an extended period of time. Facebook, in contrast, 
feels more like a big chat room, where yesterday's posts scroll off
into nothingness and where you can't get back to any discussion you
once had - no matter how good it was.</p>

<p>Twitter doesn't give you the paragraph-sized chunks of discussion that
you need to actually have an intelligent conversation, but it does 
have long-lived hashtags that enable a community of interest to form
and (with scheduled chats) thrive. It's possible to find people who
you don't know who share an interest and to communicate with them in
such a way that a simple enough search brings back something useful.
Nothing on Facebook behaves that way.</p>

and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting
outages as well as citizens would have them do. </p>

<p>The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL,
the <a href="http://www.lbwl.com/">Lansing Board of Water and Light</a>. Even though the surrounding
area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly
encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing,
LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively 
unusual in this day and age.</p>

<p>The map below is a crowd-sourced tracking of outages and
restorations in the Lansing area. It's been put together
under the lead of @<a href="http://twitter.com/jsiarto">jsiarto</a> (Jeff Siarto) with the help of
other Lansing area residents and with data pulled in part from
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LansingBWL">LBWL Facebook page</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike Consumers Energy and DTE, Lansing Board of Water and Light doesn't have a real time outage map for customers, but it's something the company is currently developing, according to company spokesperson Steve Serkaian.</p>
  
  <p>"We're working on a "smart grid" system that's similar to what other utilities offer, but it's something that costs a significant amount of money to implement," he said. "But we have heard our customers loud and clear and we're committed to working on communicating with them better."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(BWL General Manager J. Peter Lark) said BWL is running at “optimum” staffing levels. On Friday, he said, 30 crews were on the ground, a figure that includes 12 line crews and five tree-trimming crews. Crews are made up of two or three people, with most line crews using three.
  The utility to date has brought in outside help from five other municipally owned utilities, but Lark said Friday he doesn’t plan to bring in more — at least one BWL employee would have to ride with the outside crew, and that would reduce the number of BWL crews in operation.</p>

  <p>Most of those still without power are customers of Lansing’s public utility. Angry customers showed up at a company press conference yesterday to complain about the slow repairs. The number of Lansing Board of Water and Light customers without power actually increased yesterday as melting ice from tree limbs damaged more power lines.</p>

  <p>The press conference confirmed communication failures on the part of the officials involved. But when will that get better? Why not now? When will the outages be over? When will the community return to normal? When will the powers-that-be get their act together so people can make wise choices? Temperatures are expected to plunge into single digits tonight. What should people whose power is out do now? Move their families, especially the elderly and infirm, to other locations? Can people with pets still take them to the Ingham County Animal Shelter? When will those who should have the answers start communicating effectively?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This delicious lentil, feta, and olive pasta salad is adapted from the cookbook <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/best-125-meatless-pasta-dishes/oclc/24375167">The Best 125 Meatless Pasta Dishes</a> by <a href="http://mindycooks.blogspot.com/">Mindy Toomay</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/author/geiskopfhadlersusann">Susann Geiskopf-Hadler</a>, published by <a href="http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/article/setting-the-pace-prima-publishing-12266/1">Prima Publishing</a> in 1992.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of water to 1.5 cups of lentils in a saucepan on the stove. Add 2 bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then cook 25-35 minutes until the lentils are done. Rinse under cold water and drain. Note: you'll want lentils that hold their shape in cooking; look for French lentils or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/855532">lentils du Puy</a> in the bulk section of your favorite grocer.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, chop vegetables. Note that all vegetables are to be chopped small, so that they are not that much bigger than the lentils. For the vegetables:</p>

<ul>
<li>one bell pepper, green or red</li>
<li>1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted of course</li>
</ul>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, wash a bunch of parsley, and run it through the food processor until it is chopped very fine.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, make a salad dressing, which is a nice garlicky vinaigrette.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
<li>2 medium cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced fine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Near the end of the lentil cooking time, put on pasta to cook. </p>

<p>Just before serving, dice or crumble some feta and put it into a separate bowl, in the case that you have dinner guests who don't care for feta.</p>

<p>Get a large bowl, and mix the lentils, vegetables, parsley, and dressing together in it.</p>

<p>Very delicious. Serve at room temperature.</p>

<p>Prep time - 45 to 60 minutes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.</p>

<p>In the winter months it's harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it's warm. That all said, there's no less need to be mindful of how much exercise you are getting when it's cold out.</p>

<p>In days past, I was able to predict my mood rather accurately by checking how many steps I got on my pedometer. If the number was below 5000 you could count on me to be grouchy, and those rare days when the count exceeded 20000 were days when I couldn't concentrate on much of anything except moving. There's a seasonally adjusted optimum of approximately 10000 steps - minus a few in winter, plus a few in summer - that I think of as a target that if I happen to move that much in a day that everything else works out OK.</p>

<p>I've used <a href="http://www.walkertracker.com">Walker Tracker</a> on and off since 2006, or so the stats tell me, and in that time I've logged over 7 million steps. Though the site interface has changed a little bit and my old crowd of fellow pedestrians has mostly moved on from the site, there are still a few familiar faces of people more industrious than I am in logging their activity. I'm looking forward to revisiting it and being a bit more diligent about getting out and about in the winter time.</p>

<p>Note to self: buy new mittens, ideally ones that let me have at least one index finger free to work my phone.</p>

<p>Note to self 2: the battery is said to last 6 months, whether you use the system or not, so be prepared to change it on the summer solstice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite".</p>

<p>The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. Because the Twitter writing environment is so spare, it's relatively easy to produce something or react to something in a way that doesn't require a fully formed idea or any of the other agonies that accompany longer format writing.</p>

<p>Here is a recipe for writing more in this blog. Don't worry about how much you tweet, because you are treating those tweets as the short form of your work. When the muse is silent, go back to your own tweets and see which ones of them deserve to be longer. Even the stereotypical "eating a sandwich" tweet can be stretched into 200 words if you want, by turning that throwaway observation into a recipe. Almost anything worth visiting in 140 characters is worth revisiting in longer form; take advantage of the short form as a stockpile of ideas to pull from when it's time to write longer.</p>

<p>Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It's distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!</p>

<p>Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated. Case in point, a <a href="http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html">hack of Dogewallet</a> caused several people's stash of Dogecoins to vanish into the hands of an as of yet unknown person who managed to get to the file system of the Dogewallet "secure" system and change the destination address for Dogecoin transfers. About 30 million coins were stolen.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious).</p>

<p>The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 lbs sweet potatoes, boiled 7 minutes, peeled, cut into 1" chunks</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 lime</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 orange</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>2 tsp chipotle chili powder</li>
<li>2 cans (15 oz each) of black beans, rinsed well and drained</li>
<li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a dressing of the olive oil, lime juice, orange juice, cumin, chipotle powder; mix well.</p>

<p>Combine the ingredients in a large bowl. I put half the sweet potatoes at the bottom, then one can of beans, then more sweet potatoes, then more beans, with green onions and cilantro at the top. Pour the dressing over and mix.</p>

<p>This works well the next day as leftovers, if you have any!</p>
