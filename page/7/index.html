<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language. Learning a new language from scratch is not the easy task, but with news reports you're not really trying to learn the language at all, just to read the text like a "bookbreaker" would read it if they were <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/How_the_Germans.pdf">decoding a secret code</a>.</p>

<p>So, Nepali news, sad all of it. Lots of photos are online, some video. Active message traffic via amateur radio is on 20 meters, which you can monitor at a <a href="http://websdr.org">WebSDR</a> station. Trying to find a good DX monitoring spot for Nepali transmissions.</p>

<p>The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I'm looking at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn't have school and so I didn't actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.</p>

<p>The first piece of the new routine is getting to the <a href="http://www.annarborymca.org/">Ann Arbor YMCA</a>. If the weather is nice and I don't have anything else going on, it's a nice bike ride; if I'm making a car trip into town for school, it's close enough to be a good next stop. The only slight problem with the Y during the day is parking, not that I'd spend money on parking, but that everyone knows to park on West Washington St. There's nothing quite like a sauna in the morning to get you going, and there's a lovely little library by the pool with a very fast wifi and good power outlets.</p>

<p>The second piece of the new routine is <a href="http://www.argusfarmstop.com/">Argus Farm Stop</a>. I had been in here when it first opened, but now the routine has settled down a bit, and after the 8:00 a.m - 9:00 a.m. coffee rush it's a pretty reasonable spot to sit and type. There's delicious day-old bread to be had at reasonable prices and they will lop off an end for you to chew on while you drink your coffee. As a bonus the parking on Second St usually has a free space on one side or another at 8:00 a.m. so I can walk to the Y, do my thing, walk back, sit for a bit and type some more, and be good to go by 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>The conversation at the Farm Stop is sparkling - talked to a fellow named Granger who's moving here from Colorado about food, where to get a good bi bim bap, and his plans with his friends to open up a glass shop in town. 
<span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Kathy Sample</span>
was behind the counter sorting out the morning flow and talking about the farmers bringing in their produce and their meats.</p>

<p>Between those two changes I now can pretty much count on being bathed, fed, watered, and have a little bit of shopping done by 10:00 a.m. If the weather is nice, I get a bike ride in to start the day, and I haven't spent any pennies on parking, and it also works to take the bus.</p>

      <p>After three or four years of planning to get Skywarn training, this year I finally did it. The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.</p>

<p>I was there with John Hritz KD8MKE and Ann Hanson. Ann captured the opening slide. There was a nifty online multiplayer game (can't recall the site it was built on) which had 95 people playing along from their smart phones!</p>

<p>My spotter ID good for 2 years is 242.</p>

<p>I brought my radio to the event and made a contact from the car with Marty KD8RGL from Canton MI. We were both using 5 watt radios contacting the W8UM repeater in Ann Arbor - I'm always surprised how well things work when they do work.</p>

<p>I discovered that it works a lot better to identify myself as "Eddie" when on the air. This because "Ed" gets misinterpreted as "Andy" all too often, and "Edward" seems awfully formal.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.</p>

<p>After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. Same form factor, bright blue in color, and the supplied antenna is a retractable whip with a magnetic base. As always it comes with no documentation and no software (you are expected to provide those).</p>

<p>I had previously used a version of "gqrx" as a radio receiver, in a package that had been built for the Mac. This time I thought I'd build from source. I went to the 'homebrew' port system and found a version that said it worked for OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), but I'm on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and the build didn't work (it crapped out in building scipy). Reading the documentation more closely the distribution says it's available through Macports, so I installed that and did "sudo port install gnuradio" and "sudo port install gqrx".</p>

<p>Macports is one of those amazing feats of modern software engineering where someone (or really a lot of people) have carefully and meticulously figured out how to take a package of source code and make it build, including tracing all of the dependencies upon which everything else needs to be built. For gqrx and GNU Radio this means (at the very bottom) that I had to have a working FORTRAN compiler so that I could compile the FORTRAN code hiding in the numerical analysis libraries. This brings me right back to the 1970s learning FORTRAN at Michigan Tech in their Summer Youth Program. I can't even imagine how old the code was that I compiled but it might actually date from then.</p>

<p>Everything did build just fine, and then I had a radio. The first test is always to tune into WCBN, which came in with a strong signal, and to key up my ham radio transmitter via Echolink to make the W8UM repeater make some noise, and to get some weather radio going. Everything I tried worked just fine and passed with flying colors, the gqrx software is more modern than it once was in a couple of very helpful ways.</p>

<p>Next was to grab one of the many versions of "dump1090" which uses the SDR radio to tune to aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that give you a version of aircraft radar. This also worked well, perhaps better than I could have expected. From home with an antenna in the middle of the house I could hear airplanes just north of Jackson, MI from Ann Arbor, MI (about 40 miles). I relocated to a cafe near the dog park (Ellsworth at Platt) that has a good view of the southern sky, and the same little bitty antenna pulled in reception from airplanes near Fort Wayne, IN (about 120 miles). </p>

<p>There's always more to try, of course. GNU Radio is a full toolkit for building your own radio design, complete with FM decoders and the like, and it has a fairly simple to understand user interface compared to how complex the underpinnings are (remember, FORTRAN). There's lots more software that uses the RTL-SDR libraries and even a port to the Raspberry Pi which I'd like to try.</p>

<p>Of note in this regard is another European flight on a similar aircraft some months earlier. Lufthansa 1829 on Nov 5th 2014 lost 4000 feet/minute of altitude after having problems with its control systems. The <a href="http://avherald.com/h?article=47d74074">Aviation Herald story</a> was written a few days later, and it references emergency airworthiness directive <a href="http://ad.easa.europa.eu/blob/easa_ad_2014_0266_E.pdf/EAD_2014-0266-E_1">2014-0266-E_1 (pdf)</a>. <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=171411">AviationSafety.net has a summary of that incident</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During climb, 12 NM NW of Pamplona, at approximately Flight Level 310, the aircraft unexpectedly decreased the pitch autonomous and started to descend. The aircraft reached a rate of descent of up to 4,000 ft/min. The crew was able to stop the descent at Flight Level 270. The flight was continued and the aircraft landed safely at its destination Munich Airport. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least superficially the incidents seem related. I am not expert enough at aviation issues to know if there is a real connection, or if this is mere coincidence.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman's Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones.</p>

<p>The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map.</p>

<p>As always with these discussions the question turned to what data there might be available to look at, and how to get it. That led us to questions of what other people were doing with municipal data in other cities, and to this New York City parking ticket analysis: <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/87573867759/success-how-nyc-open-data-and-reddit-saved-new">Success: How NYC Open Data and Reddit Saved New Yorkers Over $55,000 a Year</a>. It seems that there was a parking space in New York that looked like it was a legal spot, but turned out to be frequently ticketed because it was near a fire hydrant. After some analysis and publicity by Ben Wellington of I Quant NY, the NYC DOT repainted the stripes on the street to clearly mark this spot as a no-go.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, how would you repeat this analysis for Ann Arbor, and what would you look for? Where are there locations that frequently generate tickets, what do they look like on a map, and how much ticket revenue comes per space?  And in the public interest, are there any spots that generate disproportionate ticket frequencies that should be looked at carefully to improve signage?</p>

<p>It looks like a project. In New York there's a data catalog that includes this data set and many others; no such data has been released in Ann Arbor. So the first step is understanding what the process is for getting a year or two of ticket data to start analyzing it.</p>

<p>Update: here's a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_wellington_how_we_found_the_worst_place_to_park_in_new_york_city_using_big_data?language=en">TED Talk by Ben Wellington</a> on "How we found the worst place to park in New York City -- using big data".</p>

<p>I first got word that there was a chance of northern lights from the <a href="http://mivus.org/">Michigan VHF-UHF Society mailing list</a>, an amateur radio group. When the aurora activity is high, the VHF amateur radio bands (2 meter and 6 meter) get increased range, so ham radio operators with this interest keep an alert out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/">The Aurora Page at Michigan Tech</a> has a lot of useful links to space weather forecasts.</p>

<p>Alas no sign of or reports of northern lights in Ann Arbor - we don't exactly have a dark sky, but the storm was also not strong enough for any reports this far south.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of
maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department
of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they
cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility
company. I know it won&rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies
have at least one county that they only provide service to part
of), but as a start it&rsquo;s a pretty good one.</p>

<p>The DOE data is based on their Form EIA-861, and I&rsquo;m working from
the 2013 data set. See <a
href="http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/">Electric power
sales, revenue, and energy efficiency Form EIA-861 detailed data
files</a> if you want to get your own files. It&rsquo;s provided as Excel
(XLSX) files, so you&rsquo;ll need something compatible to read them; I
ended up using <a
href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/in2csv.html">in2csv
from csvkit</a> as the first part of the pipeline to break these
apart.</p>

<p>You get lines from the provided file that look like this:</p>

<pre>
Data Year,Utility Number,Utility Name,State,County
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Shiawassee
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,St Clair
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Tuscola
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Washtenaw
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Wayne
</pre>

<p>The next challenge is to pull a map for each county served. To do this, convert the (State,County) list to a FIPS code, using a table like this one from ORNL called <a href="http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/CoFIPS00.txt">CoFIPS00.txt</a>. (MI,Washtenaw) turns into 26161. Feed a list of FIPS codes into the Census Reporter geo API, and out comes GeoJSON files, like so: <a href="http://api.censusreporter.org/1.0/geo/show/tiger2013?geo_ids=05000US26103,05000US26003">GeoJSON for Marquette and Alger Counties, Michigan</a>. </p>

<p>We have a list of counties for each utility, so at minimum we're set right there. But we need to get 2935 of them, and it's kind of slow to wait for each one to return before fetching the next one. That motivates the use of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>, a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel. On my four core MacBook Air I ran 32 jobs in parallel, and 2935 fetches (using "curl") took 287 seconds with the median elapsed time for each job at about 3 seconds - about a 31x speedup vs doing things serially.</p>

<p>However, the GeoJSON provided is really one shape per county, and we're looking for a complete service area in a single shape, so we need to merge the result together. Here a useful tool is the "R" stats package, particularly the "rgeos", "rgdal", and "maptools" packages. </p>

<p>The first step is the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/ogrInfo">readOGR() function from the rgdal library</a>. It takes a variety of input map formats including GeoJSON and shape files and pulls them into a Spatial vector object in R. rgdal is an R interface to Frank Warmerdam's <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a>, and it handles both raster and vector geospatial data formats.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/maptools/docs/unionSpatialPolygons">unionSpatialPolygons() function from the maptools library</a> to merge the county polygons into a single polygon. The docs say that this is a wrapper around the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gUnion">gUnion() function from the rgeos library</a>. rgeos comes from the Google Summer of Code 2010, and this <a href="https://gsoc2010r.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/rgeos-introduction/">introduction to the project</a> explains the motivation. rgeos provides an R interface to <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>, which is in turn a C++ port of <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html">JTS</a>, the Java Topology Suite.</p>

<p>After you run the unionSpatialPolygons() operation, you will inevitably find that there are tiny holes in your unioned map. Geographic boundaries are complex, and as a result there are often little areas that don't quite touch, leaving little bits of land that aren't included anywhere. This algorithm from stackoverflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12663263/dissolve-holes-in-polygon-in-r">Dissolve holes in polygon in R</a>, takes care of the issue. </p>

<pre>
G.rings = Filter(function(f){f@ringDir==1},G.union@polygons[[1]]@Polygons)
G.bounds = SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(G.rings,ID=1)))
</pre>

<p>As the Polygon documentation note for ringDir: "the ring direction of the ring (polygon) coordinates, holes are expected to be anti-clockwise"</p>

<p>Having done this cleanup work, we return a GeoJSON file with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/leafletR/functions/toGeoJSON">toGeoJSON() function from the leafletR package</a>. Now I probably don't need to pull in all of leafletR; there's a <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/writeOGR">writeOGR() function in the rgdal package</a> that should also do the same work. The aside, though, is that <a href="https://github.com/chgrl/leafletR">leafletR</a> creates nice maps in R using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library.</p>

<p>With all that done, we have a new GeoJSON file that's a cleaned up merge of multiple county outlines done in R. However, the process isn't quite done. Some of the merged files don't have holes, but they do have "slivers", little angular bits of geometry from where two counties don't quite touch at their corners. I didn't find an algorithm to unsliver in R, but this <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/120286/removing-small-polygons-gaps-in-a-shapely-polygon">Removing small polygons gaps in a Shapely polygon</a> did the trick. </p>

<pre>
# Here's the algorithm
fx = poly.buffer(eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre).buffer(-eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre)
</pre>

<p><a href="http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html">Shapely</a> from Sean Gilles is a "Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library." So we're back to GEOS, which is also supported by R...which means I suspect this algorithm translates directly back into R by proper invocation of the equivalent <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gBuffer">gBuffer() function from the rgeos package</a>.</p>

<p>No matter, I installed Shapely. It's pretty fast, and if I had time to refine this operation I'd try to port all of the R code back into python using Shapely to see if I could get a meaningful speedup improvement.</p>

<p>All this description! Here's the code.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/vielmetti/13f6feae14111ff1c148">unsliver.py</a> - in Python with the Shapely library</li>

</pre>

<p>So, progress.</p>

<p>One process, written in python, takes an Excel file provided by the county and creates a GeoJSON file from it. Addresses in the file are geocoded. The original file has a set of restaurant inspection reports and three kinds of inspection problems found; I add a fourth "score" variable that's derived in some way from those three.</p>

<p>A second process (code above) is in R using the LeafletR graphing package. It in turn takes the GeoJSON file as originally provided, and writes an HTML file that reads it using the Leaflet maps package.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the result is below:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" title="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Some big caveats.</p>

<p>My color palette is all wrong - I need to think that through. </p>

<p>This process is based on a single monthly Excel file, and should be updated to include all recent inspections and not just a single month.</p>

<p>The map needs labels of some sort. (How they will look when everything is smushed together, don't know.)</p>

<p>It would be nice to have HTML links to the Arborwiki page for each restaurant, and to a deep link for the inspections itself.</p>

<p>The geocoder is a bit slow, and I should cache previous results so that it goes faster in future months.</p>

<p>RESTAURANT NAMES ARE IN ALL CAPS AND THAT'S SHOUTING.</p>

<p>Leaflet can do all sorts of things and I've hardly scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I probably could do this all in R - or all in Python - but I'm trying to spin up on both systems &amp; thus really want to use each for what they are good at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don't ask me why.) Here's some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more.</p>

<p>First, some prior art. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Tactile-Feedback-Compass-Belt/">How to make a tactile compass feedback belt</a> is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt. When you're pointing in a certain direction, the belt vibrates in that spot, and you get a continuous sense of direction. <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/esp.html">Wired Magazine wrote this up in 2007</a>, and the invention of the "feelSpace belt" is credited to Osnabrück cognitive scientist Peter König. Here's a CBC interview with Peter König from 2014.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.cbc.ca/i/caffeine/syndicate/?clipId=2626883935" width="620" height="348" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If you look at the designs for these magnetic belts, you quickly discover that the electronics to detect direction are relatively straightforward, and that there are lots of wires and buzzers that you have to harness together. So the question I have is whether there's a better way to encode direction that doesn't require a dozen motors! You'd think that you could use a code on a single vibrotactile device to "tap out" a direction, or use a pair of devices to encode "northiness" and "eastiness" to give the whole code with two points instead of a dozen. There would be a training time to learn this, and it might be less obvious than a single motor pointing north. The evident advantage of the two-motor approach over the twelve-motor approach is that the wearable device could be very small.</p>

      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40b54970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40b54970d img-responsive" alt="SensorTag" title="SensorTag" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40b54970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it's cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate.</p>

<p>I thought I'd use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch.</p>

<p>The setup:</p>

<p>Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag. I'm using RabbitMQ as my MQTT message passing system, but that's not strictly necessary for this application.</p>

<p>The Macbook has support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is what the Sensortag talks. Support for BLE in Node-RED is provided by the "noble" module, which the "sensortag" module uses to communicate with the device. Freeboard is a visualization dashboard with some simple widgets to display data coming to it.</p>

<p>This report on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dceejay/fb47301b759222e05f84">how to use the Freeboard dashboard with Node-RED</a> has all of the difficult parts. It provides a websocket listener for Freeboard, and you use the built-in websocket transmitter on Node-RED. There's a very tiny bit of logic to pull apart the data coming off the Sensortag; it could probably be less if I were more clever.</p>

<p>The Node-RED code looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>and the very simple dashboard I put together to test this looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>There's a catch to using the TI Sensortag; it sometimes turns itself off, to save battery. To correct this you can install new firmware on the device to disable the battery saving mode. The folks at MyWeatherCenter provide a <a href="http://www.myweathercenter.net/installing-a-new-firmware-for-ti-sensortag/">link to their firmware</a> which deals with the issue, at the cost of lower battery life. </p>

<p>The results: the windows are way, way colder than the inside air (about 45 degrees), but the curtains read much warmer (about 60 degrees). Thermal curtains for the win!</p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is considering hiring "downtown ambassadors" to patrol city streets, help out visitors, and keep the downtown neat and clean and welcoming. </p>

<p>As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People's Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/01/downtown_ann_arbors_vellum_to.html">Ann Arbor News story</a> tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.</p>

<p>What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. County health officials took a dim view of this, as seen in this excerpt from a <a href="http://www.healthinspection.info/establishments/1364">health inspection in February 2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Critical) Found a package of meat in a vacuum sealed package, and found beef short rib in a vacuum sealed package in the basement meat walk in cooler. These packages were the same size as the vacuum package supply in facility, and did not appear to be commercial products as there were no labels and pic could not provide any statements or boxes indicating from a commercial licensed source. Pic corrected by discarding meats in vacuum sealed packages. Found a piece of meat in a vacuum sealed package with " 140 degrees 4 and half hours" written on package in the walk in cooler. Pic states he does not know what marking mean and where this came from. Pic corrected by discarding meat. Found several pieces of sous vide equipment in the basement and main kitchen areas. Found at least 5 boxes of packages for vacuum packaging on the shelf in the basement prep area, and was denied access to room/closet next to shelf with vacuum packaging. To correct verify that no one in facility is using vacuum sealer or preparing food using sous vide method as a variance is required. This violation has repeated and a risk control plan is required to be submitted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your innovative kitchen depends on methods that are in violation of regulations, it's going to be hard to keep up the buzz when you have to give them up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.</p>

<p>Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.</p>

<p>The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. Expect the neighborliness issue to be a substantial point of discussion.</p>

<p>The downtown zoning plans revolve around the changes proposed to what's now a parking lot next to the DTE building on S Main St. The parcel abuts a residential neighborhood and the neighbors don't particularly want a giant building to the west looming over their back yards.</p>

<p>On the consent agenda is approval of an emergency repair to the city's tower truck in the sum of $64,464.93 which is to repair damage from an accident on October 31, 2014. The fire department has brought its 18 year old previous tower unit back into service in reserve, according to the city administrator's notes accompanying the purchase order approval request.</p>

<p>Council will take up the issue of rezoning of a parcel at 3601 Plymouth Road to allow the construction of a Plum Market on the land most recently occupied by Cleary University.</p>

<p>It should be an early night at council.</p>
