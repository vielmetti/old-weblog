<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/"><code>squid</code> is a web caching system</a>. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don't have the data, and way faster when you do.</p>

<p>I'm doing some automated data collection from the web using <code>curl</code>, and as a part of that I want to not be overly aggressive in harvesting details from a site if I already have a recent copy of the data that hasn't changed. Putting a cache in the way makes sense, since unlike most GUI based browsers that have their own caches, <code>curl</code> just fetches whatever it's asked for unquestioningly even if it just got the same thing seconds ago - unless you tell it to use a cache.</p>

<p>The first appearance of squid dates to 1996, so it's old software by modern standards. It dates from the bad old days when the Internet was slow on long haul links but fast locally, and so it made all the sense in the world to optimize and economize. Even now there are lots of times and places where the net is slow enough that you're willing to introduce a little bit of complexity in exchange for a little bit of speed.</p>

<p>I installed my copy of squid on my Mac using MacPorts, which seems to do a fine job. I had also tried to build a copy of squid using what looked like simple instructions on Docker using the configuration on <a href="https://github.com/michaljemala/docker-squid">@michaeljemala/docker-squid</a>, but for reasons as of yet unexplained I got the error message</p>

<p><code>
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3128: Connection refused
</code></p>

<p>after setting that up and following package directions.  Still puzzling out whether that's a result of some Docker configuration oddness on 1.7.0, or something else. Anyway, the native version is working, so I'm good for now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don't think that's the part of the hobby I'm most interested in.</p>

<p>The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you'd think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that's hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. It feels really noisy and unnecessarily difficult. I am told that some contesters use software defined radio to watch more of the band - that seems more effective than just listening to one narrow channel and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>I guess I'm much more used to using repeaters than I am to simplex operations. With a repeater at least you have a positive acknowledgement that your transmission was received by a machine, and with that you can get a better sense for what you sound like on the air. I'm also used to a station acting as "net control" and acknowledging people and managing the flow of conversations. In contrast the contest sounds like chaos.</p>

<p>For whatever the unfamiliarity is, the other reality is that to listen to it, contests can be pretty boring. People give out the barest of bare minimum of information about their station and then move on.</p>

<p>What Field Day brings to mind is a much more interesting event I was a little part of last year, the <a href="http://www.nj2bb.org/museum/">Museum Ships Weekend Event</a> run by The Battleship New Jersey Amateur Radio Station NJ2BB. I went to the Hands-On Museum in early June 2014 and listened and talked to shipboard radio stations on museum ships around the world. It was a lot more fun because the station operators were less concerned about maximizing the count of their contacts and more interested in telling the stories of their museums. </p>

      <p>I don't really need more wifi access points in the house, but I do need more wired ethernet ports. Thanks to ellemef's box o'goodies I have a WRT54GL to play with, and I put DD-WRT on it set up in a configuration to run as a switch plugged into my existing ATT UVerse router. </p>

<p>I got the <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54GL">DD-WRT firmware loaded</a> by following the provided directions. Then I followed the instructions at <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Switch">You are here: DD-WRT wiki mainpage / Linking Routers / Switch</a> for configuration. A quick reboot and some recabling and a couple of Raspberry Pis now have their own ethernet ports.</p>

<p>The WRT54GL has a tiny amount of memory by modern standards - 4 megabytes of flash, and only 16 megabytes of system memory - but that's fine for the software of its era.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gogs is a self-hosted Git server, an alternative to using Github as a for-pay hosted service or Gitlab as another self-hosted system. It's written in the Go language, and is said to be sparing of system resources.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 11.01.35 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 11.01.35 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>I'm building it using Docker on a Raspberry Pi 2, thanks to the folks at Hypriot; the writeup is <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/run-your-own-github-like-service-with-docker/">Run your own GitHub-like service with the help of Docker</a>, and the file on Dockerhub is at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian/">hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian</a>. The install went essentially as described; note that if you are using Avahi to provide a .local name service, you can avoid using IP addresses in configuration files and instead use names like "black-pearl.local" as your hostname.</p>

<p>Juan B. Rodriguez did a nice writeup of <a href="http://jbrodriguez.io/gogs-an-alternative-to-gitlab/">Gogs, an alternative to Gitlab</a>, again with a Docker based installation description and a nice feature comparison.</p>

<p>After some poking around with Gogs I noted three substantial limitations, none of which are complete show-stoppers but which collectively give me pause about doing a wholesale replacement of Github with Gogs; and a fourth that gives me hope for some project that might address these issues but which might not end up being called Gogs.</p>

<p>First, there's no built-in wiki. I don't always use a wiki with a Github repository, and when I do I'm not always thrilled by the minimalist features of Github's wiki, but it's mighty handy and I miss it right away. Gogs doesn't have a wiki, and though it's been an acknowledged issue for a long time it doesn't seem to have any forward movement.</p>

<p>Second, there's no built-in file editor. I'm very used to the workflow where you see a file that has some small problem, you fork the repository right in the editor, type in your fix, save, and submit your patch to the maintainers. It's a very straightforward way of doing small things efficiently without dropping down to the command line, and the lack of it makes Gogs hard to understand how it would work in a mostly-web world.</p>

<p>Third, Gogs has a lot of obvious copying from Github, and I'm uncertain about the whole ethos of wholesale replication of documentation. Sometimes there's not even an effort made to document what the system does and instead there's just a link to Github documentation. Self-hosted systems should have self-hosted documentation, and even if you're replicating someone else's system faithfully you still need to write up your own docs.</p>

<p>Fourth and finally, Gogs has been forked. "gitea" is "Git with a cup of tea", and it seems to have a bunch of energy to fix things that the Gogs project is currently lacking. See <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea">the gitea project on Github</a> and its corresponding <a href="https://gitter.im/go-gitea/gitea">gitter chat for gitea</a>. gitea has not produced a release yet, but when it does I'll be sure to look for a reasonable packaging of it to try it out.</p>

<p>All of that said, I'm happy to have found Gogs, and plan to poke through it some more and store some not-very-important files in it for a while until I get some confidence in it. I don't think it (or gitea) is an instant replacement for my hosted Github service, but for the narrow purpose of holding a private repository beyond what Github provides for its service plan it looks like a reasonable alternative now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I followed the instructions on <a href="http://www.linuxmediaserver.net/linux-basics/streaming-webcam-raspberry-pi/">this post on LinuxMediaServer.net</a> to get an old Logitech web camera running on a Raspberry Pi 2. Here are some of the changes I did from the original to support my hardware.</p>

<p>lsusb returns this device:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 046d:08ae Logitech, Inc. QuickCam for Notebooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to add a driver for the camera:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo modprobe gspca_zc3xx</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The camera I have shows up as /dev/video0 and has a resolution of 320x240:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo ./mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so -r 320x240 -d /dev/video0" -o "./output_http.so -w www" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Existence proof, showing that it works. You should be able to recognize the Festifools t-shirt.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>It's not an awesome camera, but the resolution is perfectly adequate to a small task. A next challenge, should I choose to take it on, is to wrap up all of the dependencies into a Dockerfile and do a Docker build. I'm going to wait on that until Docker 1.7.1 drops since 1.7.0 is not stable on ARM platforms. I haven't yet successfully managed to get Docker on the Pi to read from USB devices (but how hard, indeed, could it be).</p>

<p>UPDATE: looks like @chuckleb built a Dockerfile for this for Ubuntu at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/chuckleb/mjpg-streamer/">chuckleb/mjpg-streamer</a>. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: If you're using the Raspberry Pi camera, <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi">Miguel Grinberg has these build instructions for that device</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've deleted Facebook from my phone, though I haven't closed out my account there. Look for me to be there less and here (on this blog) more.</p>

<p>Facebook is a never ending stream. You start to look at it, and you are never done. There's never a "congratulations, you are all caught up" message to be found. It's just too big to make sense of, and too much of a potential time sink.</p>

<p>I suspect that this hiatus will be temporary, as I have previously <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">quit Twitter</a> and look at me now.</p>

<p>"The only way to win is not to play." </p>

<p>With the time I have left from not being on Facebook I should be able to send more postcards, write more blog entries, sort through some accumulated paper, and what not. It's not like there's any shortage of other things to do in person and on the net.</p>

<p>UPDATE: When I don't look at Facebook, I look at this weblog more; and when I look at this weblog, I do more tech stuff and less non-tech stuff. That's an OK balance.</p>


  <h3>26 June 2015</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-26-docker-170-issues-problems-with-mac-and-boot2docker-arm-and-disk-size-of-images/">Docker 1.7.0 issues: problems with Mac and boot2docker, ARM, Ubuntu, and disk size of images</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Docker 1.7.0 has been released into the wild. Every .0 release of software should be expected to have some issues, no matter how good the QA and automated test process. Here's what to expect if you're getting Docker 1.7.0 up and running.</p>

<h3>boot2docker on Mac</h3>

<p>On the Mac, with boot2docker: <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/938">Docker certs not valid with 1.7 upgrade</a> is issue 938 on boot2docker. The symptom is a message like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error occurred trying to connect: Get https://192.168.59.103:2376/v1.19/containers/json: x509: certificate is valid for 127.0.0.1, 10.0.2.15, not 192.168.59.103</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and restarting docker on the VM with <code>boot2docker ssh sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart</code> fixes it, at least temporarily. Read through the issue on github to see the full diagnosis - as best I understand it, eth1 is not up when certificates are generated, hence the cert not valid error.</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi or any other ARM system</h3>

<p>On a Raspberry Pi: <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14184">Docker 1.7 on RaspberryPI : "socket operation on non-socket"</a> is issue 14184 on docker. The symptom is a message like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[tki@anzu ~]$ docker start redis
  Error response from daemon: Cannot start container redis: socket operation on non-socket
  Error: failed to start containers: [redis]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error flushed out a whole set of people running Docker on ARM on a variety of platforms, all having similar issues. If you're running a Scaleway C1, ODROID C1, ODROID XU3-Lite, Utilite Pro, Cubox 4x4, and all flavors of Raspberry Pi or Pi 2 you'll see this. "When using --net host the container starts" is the report, but port forwarding fails to work in that case.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu: problems with statically compiled Docker binaries</h3>

<p>The issue is <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14035">Ubuntu 15.04 vivid can not start docker 1.7.0</a>, docker issue 14035. The relevant bits of the error message are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ERRO[0000] Udev sync is not supported. This will lead to unexpected behavior, data loss and errors. For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#daemon-storage-driver-option </p>
  
  <p>ERRO[0000] [graphdriver] prior storage driver "devicemapper" failed: driver not supported </p>
  
  <p>FATA[0000] Error starting daemon: error initializing graphdriver: driver not supported </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a long discussion, culminating in <code>In the end, removing /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/ will fix the issue</code>, but people are also rolling back to 1.6.2. </p>

<h3>Ubuntu on x86: large file sizes</h3>

<p>A report that <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-1-7-0-is-using-huge-amount-of-disk-space/2046">Docker 1.7.0 is using huge amounts of disk space</a> appears on the Docker forum, item 2046. <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14204">Pulling image fills disk/image size is huge, version 1.7.0</a> is issue 14204 on Docker. Not much insight into this one yet.</p>

      <p>The opinion in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. </p>
  
  <p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.</p>

<p>There's lots of Reddy Kilowatt information and memorabilia on <a href="http://www.reddykilowatt.org/">ReddyKilowatt.org</a>.</p>

  <p>This is a completely unofficial web site dedicated to Reddy Kilowatt. It features history, memorabilia, items for sale and more. Please note that I can’t/don’t/won’t estimate the value of any of your Reddy collectibles. Seriously. Ever. Try looking at the going price at eBay or at other antique dealers if you want to find out how much any particular Reddy Kilowatt item might be worth. More about Reddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From here I found the <a href="http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!265798!0">Reddy Kilowatt Records, 1926-1999, Archives Center, National Museum of American History.</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Reddy Kilowatt trademark was created in 1926 by Ashton B. Collins. Reddy Kilowatt, Inc. licensed the trademark promotion and identification purposes by more than 150 investor-owned electric utilities in the United States and at least 12 foreign countries. The company later changed its name to Reddy Communications, Inc. In 1998 Northern States Power Company bought Reddy Communications and its assets, later changing its name to Xcel Energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More on Ashton B. Collins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Administrative/Biographical History: Ashton B. Collins, Sr. (1885-1976), the commercial manager of Alabama Power Company, created the trademark character Reddy Kilowatt in 1926 in an attempt to humanize electric utility service for marketing and other corporate communications purposes. Reddy Kilowatt first appeared publicly at the 1926 Alabama Electrical Exposition in a display for the Alabama Power Company, which also ran supporting newspaper advertisements. The original figure had five arms to illustrate the many capabilities of electric service. Though Collins originated the idea of Reddy Kilowatt, he asked an engineer from the company’s drafting department, Dan Clinton, to create a usable sketch of the character. After the exposition, Collins retained the copyrights to Reddy Kilowatt. In 1932, he recruited a friend, Dorothea Warren, to develop several sketches of Reddy Kilowatt in an attempt to sell what Collins called “The Reddy Kilowatt Program.” At the time, Collins was employed by Edison Electrical Institute to travel the country promoting electrical household cooking appliances. He used the opportunity to network with electric utility managers and to promote his idea of using Reddy Kilowatt to humanize electric service in the home. Collins convinced his first clients in 1933. By the end of 1934, at least six other electric utility companies had adopted the “Reddy Kilowatt Program.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Noted as an example of "how do they do that"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.kinectrics.com/Solutions/Pages/real-time-digital-simulator-rtds.aspx">Kinetrics</a> has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. The vendor of the software is <a href="https://www.rtds.com/">RTDS Technologies</a> which describes it also thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are the pioneer and exclusive supplier of this custom hardware and software, which is specifically designed to perform real time electromagnetic transient simulations.</p>
  
  <p>The Simulator operates continuously in real time while providing accurate results over a frequency range from DC to kilohertz range. It is used for closed loop testing of protective relay and control systems, power hardware in the loop studies, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www4vip.inl.gov/research/real-time-digital-simulator/">Idaho National Laboratory has one of these simulators</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system’s graphical user interface, proprietary software and mathematical algorithms can simulate any modern electric power grid configuration. As new equipment or components are added or subtracted from the simulator’s configuration, the model instantly updates. For example, INL researchers can run simulated system–failure scenarios such as a control system cyber intrusion or a physical damage event such as a terrorist attack or natural disaster and instantly detect the order and reasoning for why dedicated relays, breakers or substations failed.</p>
  
  <p>The ability to simulate real–time power grid information is a key factor in detecting previously unknown vulnerabilities and providing emergency planners with a path forward for responding to grid failures. The RTDS Simulator enables power industry experts to define the network configuration and run real time tests for many aspects of service life allowing system problems to be discovered faster, and solutions to be designed and tested immediately.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don't have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you're expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively.</p>

<p>I'm making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python.  Some notes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Download and install Firefox</a> if you don't already have it installed, from mozilla.org.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Download and install the Selenium IDE</a> for Firefox, which lets you interactively create Selenium scripts within Firefox.</p></li>
<li><p>From the command line, <code>pip install selenium</code> to get the package of Python drivers for Selenium.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're also using Google Chrome, you'll want <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">ChromeDriver</a> to get Selenium to talk to Chrome.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With this all you have enough of the tools to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Udemy has a <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/selenium-ide-tutorial/">Selenium IDE tutorial</a> to walk through to get you started, as a prelude to their for-pay course on the same topic. Guru99 also has a <a href="http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html">free Selenium tutorial</a> that covers the Selenium IDE. </p>

<p><a href="http://scraping.pro/selenium-ide-and-web-scraping/">A very nice overview of the process</a> from scraping.pro gives you some insight into what's really going on. The workflow is to create interactive scripts from within Firefox, then export them to Python and run them through a driver that drives multiple browsers. You can tweak lots of details in the Python script and incorporate those into some bigger applications.</p>

<p>Best bet though is to find someone who knows it and watch over their shoulder and ask questions!</p>

<p>A brief note on two pages I refer to during severe weather, like the storms that rolled through the area on Monday night and Tuesday early morning that led to <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/June_2015_Manchester_tornado">tornado damage in Manchester</a> on the morning of June 23, 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lightningmaps.org/">LightningMaps.org</a> has a zoomable near real time map of lightning strikes. You can zoom and pan around looking at locations of lightning strikes, with a small (less than 10 seconds) delay. When everything lines up right you can see the lightning strike on your computer before you hear the thunder.</p>

<p>The LightningMaps data comes from the <a href="http://www.blitzortung.org">BlitzOrtung</a> project, which has deployed a set of custom designed lightning detectors world wide. From their page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Blitzortung.org" is a lightning detection network for the location of electromagnetic discharges in the atmosphere (lightning discharges) based on the time of arrival (TOA) and time of group arrival (TOGA) method. It consists of several lightning receivers and one central processing server. The stations transmit their data in short time intervals over the Internet to our server. Every data sentence contains the precise time of arrival of the received lightning discharge impulse ("sferic") and the exact geographic position of the receiver. With this information from all stations the exact positions of the discharges are computed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blitzortung is working on a new generation of lightning detectors, which are not yet available, and they are no longer manufacturing their first generation of detectors. Even so the US coverage of lightning detection is very good and recommended for storm tracking. The project lead is Egon Wanke of Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">Using GNU Parallel to speed up network operations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough.</p>

<p>Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. If you are working on something where it doesn't matter which order things happen in as long as they all get done you are in good shape to get tremendous performance improvements simply by overlapping operations.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>DTE Energy does not have one single page on their web site that shows you the total number of outages across their system - or if they do have it, it's so well hidden that I haven't found it. What they do have is a way to fetch the outage count for a single ZIP code. So, armed with a set of zip codes, you can determine a total. You don't care which ZIP is fetched first but you do want them all to show up before you add them up.</p>

<p>The one-line command I have for this is</p>

<p><code>
parallel -P 32 -a ~/data/dte-zips ~/bin/dte-by-zip | jq -s add
</code></p>

<p>The script dte-by-zip runs as follows, fetching a page from a DTE server and parsing it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ dte-by-zip 48104</p>
  
  <p>38</p>

<p>thus the parallel invocation reads roughly as follows: "for 32 parallel threads, using the dte-zips data file one line a time as command line arguments, run dte-by-zip; add up all the results".</p>

<p>Note that if you are using "curl" to fetch pages, you want to be aware of the <code>--max-time</code> option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-m, --max-time <seconds>
               Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to
               take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
               ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you don't want to go too crazy with parallel operations on network resources, it's possible to overrun a remote server and it might be faster to pull 8 or 16 parallel threads instead of 32 or 64 depending on the nature of the remote machine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/">runC</a>. It's a "lightweight universal plumbing" that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of Docker's start on Linux systems, it's been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. Some tries to make it work depend on setting up virtual machines (with the likes of boot2docker) which makes it work at the cost of performance and flexibility. Docker on OS X has not been exceptionally easy though it does work once you commit to doing all of your Docker server work inside a VM</p>

<p>runC would be an answer to the problem of native Docker on OSX X, one might hope, but as of its first release it doesn't work. The first of what is probably many hurdles is the extensive use of the clone(2) system call instead of fork(2). This <a href="http://files.meetup.com/10602292/See%20Docker%20from%20the%20Perspective%20of%20Linux%20Process.pdf">presentation from Allen Sun at DaoCloud</a> goes into the details of Docker's use of clone(2) from the perspective of Linux processes. It is notable that the OS X "Darwin" kernel doesn't have clone(2), and it's as far as I can tell not readily possible to mimic all of clone's semantics strictly by using fork in clever ways.</p>

<p>An open issue on Github is tracking <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/9">Build fails on Mac OS X 10.9</a>. I don't see an easy fix without work by Apple on their kernel.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I attended this week's meeting of the Governance Committee of the Ann Arbor Board of Education, and this is what I saw.</p>

<p>Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting.</p>

<p>One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online. It had several typoes and missspellings, including an incorrect reference to statute.</p>

<p>A last agenda item (FOIA) had a completely incorrect document posted online, which caused measurable confusion at the meeting as trustees were reviewing a document which was not actually the one that they were asked to review. </p>

<p>I believe that these routine postings of documents from staff to the board are the responsibility of district staff, and that the board secretary is the particular person tasked with getting documents online in a timely manner. I have no idea how well Board Docs works but if it's anything like the city's Legistar system it's probably difficult to use enterprise software. Nevertheless, it's the responsibility of the board and of the executive staff to produce these records in a timely manner to prepare not just the public but <em>also the board</em> for their meetings, and this situation deserves attention to see if there's scheduling or training or other management effort to ensure that Board Docs is always up to date as a matter of good policy and practice.</p>

<p>(Also, Balas has the best welcome signs.)</p>

<p>Plus: fun to ride, big front basket. It's a very nice bike that you're riding, with a good 3 speed shifter and a very sturdy construction. </p>

<p>Minus: no lights, no bell, no helmets. More specifically, I am told that the lights come on automatically, and that there is a bell somewhere, but I didn't find it and it wasn't labeled. I did have a helmet with me so I wore that.</p>

      <p>Why is 410 Miller still standing, after the Building Board of Appeals issued an order for it to be demolished? In part, because the Notice and Order to demolish was never sent. From FOIA 15-210:</p>
