<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>@tallervielmetti is using my old black Macbook. It's never been an exceptionally fast machine, but it's been super laggy of late, hence the name Lag Monster. </p>

<p>I installed all kinds of crap on that machine to test it out, and never uninstalled a lot of it. It turns out that some judicious uninstalls seemed to help a lot to keep the load average down. Some hints to my future self if these ever re-emerge:</p>

<p>BBLaunchAgent. Yes, relics of my old Blackberry still linger on, and to really and truly kill them I had to edit plists. See <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2752009?start=0&amp;tstart=0">Can't delete BBLaunchAgent.app process</a> for the eventual diff I applied. For a more exhaustive list of Blackberry-uninstalling tools see <a href="https://blog.omgmog.net/post/removing-the-blackberry-desktop-software-for-mac-without-having-to-re-download-a-70mb-installer-from-blackberry/">Removing the Blackberry Desktop Software for Mac without having to re-download a 70mb installer from Blackberry</a>.</p>

<p>Jenkins. Some time in the distant past I installed it, and it launched under Java and ran and did nothing for years except contribute to lag. Killed by removing the install directory and rebooting.</p>

<p>Chrome. Lots of Chrome stuff takes up memory. Particularly contributing to lag was some Reddit page. </p>

<p>At the end we're at</p>

<p>Processes: 77 total, 2 running, 1 stuck, 74 sleeping, 355 threads      22:40:09
 Load Avg: 0.22, 0.67, 0.68  CPU usage: 17.75% user, 12.14% sys, 70.9% idle</p>

<p>Which is, I have to say, a lot better.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some notes before I try to do the build.</p>

<p>The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.</p>

<p>Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.</p>

<p>The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). Some sort of adapter jack (or alligator clips) should be all I need.</p>

<p>I can test the antenna on my Nokia 635 which has an FM tuner connected with the headphone jack as the antenna, and the ideal situation will be to have an antenna that I can just plug either into my phone or into my SDR tuner interchangeably. Once I figure all that out, the next next step is to make these antenna inputs for other radios. One step at a time though.</p>

<p>I'll be working from the tutorial <a href="http://willus.com/author/antenna.shtml">Making a Dipole FM Antenna</a> on willus.com .</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My goal for the week was to empty out my inbox sufficiently that I would be able to make progress on some programming tasks that are hard to do when there's distractions. The inbox got all the way down to zero, and that meant that there was a chunk of evening time suitable for hacking. Happy to report that the result of this is Node-RED running on a Raspberry Pi under Docker on top of Hypriot. A word of explanation of how this all works in detail is too much, but here's where I got the parts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-on-your-arm-device/">Hypriot's gettting started guide</a> brings you up to speed on getting Docker running on your ARM device (e.g. your Raspberry Pi). They have bootable images that you can download and burn to SD card, and from there you load up applications from Docker.</p>

<p>Hypriot has a <a href="https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk">chat window</a> on Gitter, so you can pop in and there will be occasionally people to assist. Best to do things European time.</p>

<p>Docker's <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> is a one stop shop for packaged applications. When you're running on the Pi, you'll want to seek out versions with 'rpi' or 'arm' in their names as they have likely been adapted for that system.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling Niel Eyde's Raspberry Pi versions of Node-RED from DockerHub as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/">nieleyde/rpi-nodered</a>. It has all sorts of interesting modules that I had not previously built.</p>

<p>Node-RED is at 0.10.6 at this writing. Its <a href="http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi.html">Raspberry Pi support</a> includes hardware support using <a href="http://wiringpi.com/">WiringPi</a> to access the GPIO pins. </p>

<p>Node-RED currently supports Node.JS 0.10. Node.JS and IO.JS have <a href="http://sdtimes.com/node-js-and-io-js-to-merge-under-node-js-foundation/">merged forces</a> after a fork, which means hopefully development will start to be sane again.</p>

<p>That all said I am not sure I have everything I need yet but as a leap forward it's pretty good!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.</p>

<p>For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. </p>

<p>For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. I'm especially happy about the Sony because I had feared that it was a complicated repair. There's some corrosion on the battery terminals and I might be forewarned that would be the first thing to look at again. A discussion of another repair is written up by <a href="http://idlenot.com/?p=1481">KE1RI</a> to replace an audio capacitor, fortunately I haven't had to do that.</p>

<p>Both stations are tuned to R Havana Cuba's Sunday night programming on 6000 KHz.</p>

      <p>The rented lakes of my childhood 
 by Marge Piercy </p>

<pre>
 I remember the lakes of my Michigan
 childhood. Here they are called ponds.
 Lakes belonged to summer, two-week
 vacations that my father was granted by
 Westinghouse when we rented some cabin.

 Never mind the dishes with spiderweb
 cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce
 pans, the crusted black frying pans.
 Never mind the mattresses shaped
 like the letter V. Old jangling springs.

 Moldy bathrooms. Low ceilings
 that leaked. The lakes were mysteries
 of sand and filmy weeds and minnows
 flickering through my fingers. I rowed
 into freedom. Alone on the water

 that freckled into small ripples,
 that raised its hackles in storms,
 that lay glassy at twilight reflecting
 the sunset then sucking up the dark,
 I was unobserved as the quiet doe

 coming with her fauns to drink
 on the opposite shore. I let the row-
 boat drift as the current pleased, lying
 faceup like a photographer’s plate
 the rising moon turned to a ghost.

 And though the voices called me
 back to the rented space we shared
 I was sure I left my real self there-
 a tiny black pupil in the immense
 eye of a silver pool of silence.

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.</p>

<p>I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city's employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained. The city has hired a contractor to handle the building official's role, but that contractor is not working on the day of this meeting. </p>

<p>The group's meetings are in Legistar, which I looked at at 8:30 a.m. today before a 1:30 p.m. meeting. Legistar should have details and staff reports for all of the items on the agenda, but as of 8:30 a.m. there was only the barest detail listed, with five parcels under review but no detail for any of those parcels and no information about old business to be reviewed. Several members of the board noted that they did not get any email from the building department reminding them that there was going to be a meeting, let alone informing them of the agenda.</p>

<p>When I got to the meeting at 1:30 p.m. I find that one of the items was removed from the agenda (that's pretty typical) and there was a bare minimum of documentation for the other four items. Bare minimum in this case included photos but no writeup of the staff recommendation and no detail at all. There were also two surprise agenda items under old business, neither of which had any written supporting documentation.</p>

<p>At the meeting itself there was a fair amount of confusion. One unfortunate petitioner who was asking for a variance for basement apartment filled out his form asking for this as a Housing Board of Appeals request, but then someone (the petitioner or the city, not sure who) whited out the word "Housing" and replaced it with "Building". Some substantial amount of time was spent sorting out which appeals board actually would address the appeal, and the petitioner felt that it should be the Housing Board of Appeals that would address a variance for occupancy.</p>

<p>Of course that discovers another problem. The Housing Board of Appeals, as currently constituted, has three members; but seven are specified by charter, and thus it does not have a quorum and cannot meet.</p>

<p>What kind of Kafkaesque city do we live in where matters are best referred to a body that cannot meet!</p>

<p>I spoke up at public commentary at the end of the meeting, there being no opportunity to speak at the beginning, pointing out some of this sad state of affairs and especially encouraging the board to prepare more carefully for meetings in such a way that members of the public would be able to avail themselves of information about the matters coming before the board. Certainly there is public interest in some of the long-term dilapidated buildings that have come before the board - in particular 410 Miller, which has been a mess as long as I can recall - but there being no adequate agenda publicized there is no way for the public to be even aware that a discussion is going on.</p>

<p>When is Ann Arbor going to have a full time building official? Without someone in an official position to make the department work, the city's systems for handling exceptional cases appears to be entirely and completely broken. I can only imagine that routine issues are under a similar sort of chaotic pressure.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it's running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it's also quite economical.</p>

<p>That said, there's one feature on the phone that wasn't a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him. The phone has wifi calling so it should have worked just fine where I was, a spot that has poor cell reception. But the call never came, and by the time I idly checked my messages I had missed several calls. How did that happen?</p>

<p>Windows Phone and Cortana has a feature called Quiet Hours. In <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-quiet-hours-and-inner-circles-windows-phone-81">How to set up Quiet Hours and Inner Circles on Windows Phone 8.1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsabri">Sam Sabri</a> writes for Windows Central a nice tutorial on how to set it up and configure the phone to not ring during some hours of the day and to allow some people to specially ring the phone even when it's set to no ring. It's a good tutorial, and if I had read it carefully and thought it through I could have set it up to always take calls from important people late at night.</p>

<p>The truth is, though, that I already have another phone system (Google Voice) that I could already use to reroute or divert calls, and having that power in my phone though nice is the opposite of what I wanted. If it's late and someone calls me, I want to take the call. So my suggestion to you for your new Windows Phone is - if you want to use it as a phone - that you start out your device setup by disabling Quiet Hours, and only add it back in once you have thought it through very carefully.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, May 5, 2015, 2:00 a.m. I spoke with Jim Payeur, fire chief for the Chelsea Area Fire Authority, about the gas pipeline explosion in a 20" gas transmission line in a wooded area near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road about five miles north of Chelsea, Michigan. The incident occurred at about 10:30 p.m. on May 4, when about 20 people reported a sound like a jet crash. There was no fire at the scene and no injuries reported. Some nearby residents were evacuated from their homes and sheltered at Lyndon Township Hall. Chief Payeur had "no clue" why the pipeline ruptured, and said that a crew from Consumers Energy was working on site. The scene has been cleared and residents have been allowed to return to their homes.</p>

<p>This is my final update for tonight.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:29 a.m. Called Huron Valley Ambulance (fire dispatch), was told that they were "not allowed to give out any information". The below map is from PHMSA and shows the routes of gas pipelines in the area.</p>

<p>May 5, 2015, 1:10 a.m. First hand account says they told people with a half mile to leave. Report that the fire could be heard from three miles away. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>Ann Arbor, MI, May 5, 2015, 12:37 a.m. Reports of a fire in a 20 inch gas main in Lyndon Township north of Chelsea, MI near the corner of M-52 and North Territorial Road. (Note: this was an early report; there was no fire.)</p>

<p>and its recipe for "gundruk", a fermented leafy vegetable that I have never tried to make and have not found to eat anywhere here locally.</p>

<p>There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language. Learning a new language from scratch is not the easy task, but with news reports you're not really trying to learn the language at all, just to read the text like a "bookbreaker" would read it if they were <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/How_the_Germans.pdf">decoding a secret code</a>.</p>

<p>So, Nepali news, sad all of it. Lots of photos are online, some video. Active message traffic via amateur radio is on 20 meters, which you can monitor at a <a href="http://websdr.org">WebSDR</a> station. Trying to find a good DX monitoring spot for Nepali transmissions.</p>

<p>The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I'm looking at.</p>
