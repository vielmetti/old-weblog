Candied violets are said to be very easy - dip the violet flower in egg white and then in sugar.

        <p>Writing for the Internet is not the same as writing for print.&#0160; Here are ten rules of thumb that will help you shape your writing that&#39;s designed for the screen and to help you adapt and reform words that were first printed out in ways that make them easier to manage. The paragraph is the unit of composition.&#0160; Keep your paragraphs together, making it possible to have any one of them pulled out and quoted in some other part of the internet without losing too much in the process.&#0160; If your narrative has complicated paragraphs, be aware that someone might pull out only a sentence from it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-04-21-how-to-write-for-the-web-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every year I look forward to finding pea greens, so that I can stir fry them up.&#0160; And every year at the farmer&#39;s market I don&#39;t find them.&#0160; I hope this year can be different, but I have some questions. If I wanted to grow pea greens on my own, what variety of peas would I use?
