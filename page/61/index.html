<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p><p>Typepad says that I have 2,000 posts in this weblog. &#0160;Some of them, to be sure, are drafts that were abandoned, and some are scheduled in the future, but that&#39;s as good a round number as I need to reflect on blogging (the practice and the habit).</p><div><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html">I&#39;ve been blogging since April 1999; here&#39;s the first month or so of posts. &#0160;</a>&#0160;&#0160;They were edited oh so patiently with vi, and at the time the genre was new enough that I could say with confidence &quot;Huh, this daily weblog stuff is too hard. &quot; and have that be a novel observation. &#0160; &#0160;Jorn Barger at the time noted in his Robot Wisdom blog<span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; "></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&quot;New weblog from Ed Vielmetti, who&#39;s been on the Net forever.&quot; &#0160;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span>Ten years later I&#39;m still at it. &#0160;I suppose that I might have just enough experience in blogging that even I would think of myself as an expert at it, for what that&#39;s worth. &#0160;(As Forbes once said about my bright ideas, &quot;Too bad everyone else had the same idea.&quot;) And like any good blogger, I have a nice pat seven item list to share with you - because people who read blogs love pointless numbered lists.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>1. &#0160;Repetition is the soul of the net. &#0160;If I&#39;ve told you this once, I&#39;ve said it a thousand times. &#0160;Every year, regular as clockwork, there is an audience for people reading about where to pick blueberries, how to get election returns, who makes the best paczki, what to do on your birthday or your kids birthday. &#0160;You get a free pass to repeat your good content over and over again annually, do it.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>2. &#0160;Don&#39;t think too much. &#0160;Think more, perhaps, than you would in writing a 140 character twitter message; think twice before saying something that you&#39;d regret before a judge or in print. &#0160;But don&#39;t think more than twice, and be prepared to post something before it&#39;s absolutely polished and done. &#0160;Sometimes the people who read what you are writing will fill in the blanks for you.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>3. &#0160;Omit needless words. &#0160;Your screen is small, and the day is short. &#0160;Don&#39;t ramble on and on - fill the text input box until it&#39;s full, and hit post.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>4. &#0160;Leave comments. &#0160;Comments on other people&#39;s blogs will remind them of stuff that you have collected that&#39;s relevant; comments on your own blog will let you update things that are changing without going back and re-editing. &#0160;Every once in a while, you&#39;ll unearth someone who is a bona fide expert who reads the news clippings you pasted together and gets an insight.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>5. &#0160;Don&#39;t feed the trolls. &#0160;(And there are so many of them.) &#0160;Squash idiot comments, commercial spam comments, irritating comments, stray trackbacks, and any other crud out of your blog as soon as you see it. &#0160;</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>6. &#0160;Did I mention pointless numbered lists? &#0160;Use them. &#0160;Everyone&#39;s attention span is short, and lists let people know just how far along they are before they can be done. &#0160;They let you jump from idea to idea without pesky transitions, and make it easy for someone else to cut and paste that one good idea hiding in your pile of dreck and take it for their own.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>7. &#0160;Quote liberally (and credit liberally). &#0160;Half the battle in blogging is figuring out who knows more than you do about something; the other half the battle is figuring out who is uselessly ignorant but still writes a lot. &#0160;If you are good and thorough and relentless in clipping out good paragraphs from other people&#39;s work, and you are good and thorough and relentless in doing the searches that end up in results that aren&#39;t on everyone else&#39;s front page of Google, you can learn a lot and share a lot.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>I&#39;ve been averaging a post a day for a long time. &#0160;Some days more, some days less, and some blogs are mercifully left for dead from ideas that didn&#39;t pan out. &#0160;I wish I knew what it all meant. &#0160;In some ways it reminds me a lot of my short lived but illustrious high school forensics career of impromptu speaking - all it really shows is that you can be coherent on short notice about pretty much anything, and that you have enough diligence to keep being coherent for a long time.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>If someone can tell me what career that qualifies me for, please let me know - I&#39;m looking.</span></div></p>

      <p>Some references to collect here on the use of general-purpose graphic processors in OCR.&#0160; Nominally, you run some kind of MapReduce based algorithm with a GPGPU over some image, and out spits text much faster than any ordinary processor of any speed; of course, there are lots of details to attend to.</p><p><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/Data/102604.html">From Berkeley EECS: Algorithms and Frameworks for OCR and Content-based Image Retrieval</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Jike Chong, Bryan Christopher Catanzaro, Narayanan Sundaram, Fares Hedayati and Kurt Keutzer</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A new breed of general-purpose manycore computing platform is
emerging. Exemplary examples include the Niagara from Sun Microsystems,
the G80 from Nvidia, the Cell from IBM, and the up-coming Larrabee from
Intel. These manycore processors each pack 8-32 relatively simple cores
on a chip, capable of supporting up to 100s of threads, and boast
tremendous potential peak single-chip performances up to the range of
Tera-FLOPS. However, traditional algorithms and applications in many
domains cannot take advantage of much of the parallelism provided by
these platforms. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The ParLab at Berkeley was recently founded in part to help
meet this acute need for novel algorithmic approaches to unleash the
performance potentials of emerging manycore platforms for a wide range
of application domains. It proposes to concentrate on analyzing the
communication and computation patterns (or Dwarfs) of important classes
of algorithms underlying modern application domains, and develop
techniques to efficiently parallelize them for the general purpose
manycore platforms.
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">We concentrate on the domain of image recognition and
retrieval, leveraging the Intel PIRO content-based image retrieval
framework as a motivating application. Specifically, we study the
parallelization of classification algorithms for machine learning, and
develop parallelization techniques to improve the performance of these
algorithms and applications on the emerging manycore platforms.</p><p><a href="http://www.bv2.co.uk/?p=281">Here&#39;s a discussion of an OCR system that uses the CUDA libraries called cocr</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The cuda implementation allows for exceptionally fast image
manipulation, cleaning and segmentation before being presented to the
template based ocr system.&#0160; Traditional cpu based ocr systems are very
slow, especially in the image rotation, cleaning etc departments and
although cocr is by no means a complete ocr package it is orders of
magnitude faster than the various cpu based ones I’ve tried. With a bit
more work and an additional of a neural network ocr it could easily
become a system able to do greater than realtime ocr’ing.&#0160; Neural
networks are extremely well suited to GPU implementations due to their
inherit parallelism. I will post more snippets and modules of the
system here over the coming weeks.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t able to find any evidence that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ocropus/">ocropus </a>OCR system that Google has used and released is using any parallel computing mechanisms, so this still looks like &quot;gee, it should work for someone, if you can throw a PhD student or two at it.&quot;</p>

<p><em>We are writing to inform you of the recent investigation and
analysis that was performed on the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S.
State Street.&#0160; We are also reporting on the condition of the bridge and
providing information regarding possible short- and long-term solutions
for the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street and the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>Attached, please find a Traffic Control Order (TCO) that
recommends a reduction in allowable gross vehicle weights for the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street in accordance with the
limits contained in this memorandum.</em></p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>On December 29, 2007, our Field Operations forces were called
out to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street as
medium-sized pieces of concrete were falling off of the bottom of one
of the box beams that support the roadway.&#0160; These pieces of concrete
were large enough to damage passing vehicles, if they were to strike
them.&#0160; Our Field Operations and Safety Services personnel closed one
lane of traffic at a time and removed the remaining loose concrete from
the underside of the box beam.&#0160; No injuries due to the falling concrete
were reported.</em></p>
<p><em>As a result of the concrete removal, we reviewed the structure
again and were concerned about the condition of one of the box beams.&#0160;
In early January 2008, a meeting was held on-site between Project
Management Unit, our bridge inspection consultant, and bridge design
personnel to review the condition of the bridge and (1) determine what
possible courses of action could be taken to help prevent further
damage to the bridge and (2) identify possible repair strategies.</em></p>
<p><em>We directed our consultants to re-analyze the bridge structure
given the section loss that had just occurred.&#0160; As you may recall,
effective January 1, 2008 we lowered the weight limits due to section
loss that was discovered during the biennial inspection that was
performed in late October 2007.&#0160; Based upon the new analysis that was
performed in January 2008, it is recommended that we reduce the weight
limits on this structure again.<br />
Condition of the bridge</em></p>
<p><em>The existing bridge is composed of 16 pre-stressed concrete box
beams that are laid side-by-side.&#0160; They are “tied” together with steel
post-tensioning rods that connect pairs of beams together.&#0160; The beams
are overlaid with an asphalt wearing surface.&#0160; There is a concrete
sidewalk that has been cast on top of the two northernmost beams.&#0160; The
bridge does not provide sufficient vertical or horizontal clearances
and is considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the box beams has developed a severe longitudinal crack.&#0160;
This is the beam that our field personnel had to hand-chip to remove
the spalled concrete in late December 2007.&#0160; There are other beams that
are developing longitudinal cracks, as well.&#0160; Other beams have several
broken pre-stressing strands and the abutments that support the beams
are in poor condition.&#0160; Note that the pre-stressing strands are the
primary elements of the bridge beams that provide structural strength.&#0160;
Based on these deficiencies, the bridge, viewed as a whole, is
considered to be in poor condition.&#0160; The beam that is severely cracked
is considered to be in serious condition.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon review of the “as-built” drawings of the structure, we
believe that it is not possible to repair the severely cracked beam in
any manner that can restore its structural integrity.&#0160; This is due to
the location of the beam itself, and the location and configuration of
the post-tensioning rods that tie the box beams together.&#0160; The severely
cracked beam is the fifth beam in from the south side of the
structure.&#0160; Due to the manner in which the bridge was constructed, it
is not possible to replace only this beam. In order to repair the beam,
we would have to cut the post tensioning rods on each side of the
beam.&#0160; We would not be able to access the needed areas of the beams to
re-install the post-tensioning rods, however, effectively leaving the
beams to function individually.&#0160; This would be unacceptable.&#0160; There is
also one other beam that contains small cracks that currently are not
as severe as the beam described above, but we believe that it is likely
that it, too, will crack in a similar manner.&#0160; AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE
IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST FIVE BEAMS ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THE BRIDGE, AND POSSIBLY AS MANY AS EIGHT.</em></p>
<p><em>Exacerbating the problem is the condition of the remaining
beams.&#0160; We believe that it is likely that the tops of these beams have
begun to spall.&#0160; It is apparent to us that salt-laden water has seeped
between the asphalt layer covering the beams and the beams themselves.&#0160;
Water routinely leaks around the beams and runs down the abutment
walls.&#0160; Over time, this moisture and salt will cause the concrete to
disintegrate.&#0160; Given the length of time this has been occurring, we
have reason to believe that it is possible that the tops of the beams
are damaged to the point that they may not be able to be repaired, if
we were to attempt it.</em></p>
<p><em>We also believe that any attempt at performing a repair itself
would be expensive.&#0160; We do not have detailed costs at this time, but we
estimate that it would cost at least $250,000 to attempt to replace the
five to eight south side bridge beams.&#0160; Also, it would take at least
one month to perform the needed construction.</em></p>
<p><em>At your request, we could prepare a more thorough and detailed
estimate of the repair costs and other possible options that could be
implemented should funding for the replacement of the structure not be
available in the foreseeable future.&#0160; This evaluation would cost
approximately $15,000 to retain the services of a structural engineer
to analyze and review various options.&#0160; We also recommend that about
$10,000 be budgeted for our Field Services personnel to assist in the
performance forensic investigations on the bridge in order to better
determine the extent of deterioration of the existing bridge beams and
abutments.</em></p>
<p><em>We do not believe that it is possible to repair the bridge over
S. State Street cost effectively, however.&#0160; This is due to the
extensive deterioration of the existing beams, abutments, and
asphalt-wearing surface.&#0160; As mentioned previously, the bridge is
considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.&#0160; These
deficiencies cannot be easily remedied.&#0160; We will, of course, continue
to monitor the condition of the bridge. Should it become necessary, we
are prepared to repair the structure in order to allow the bridge to
remain in service.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Short-term Action</em></p>
<p><em>In order to help minimize damage to this structure and prolong
its life span to the greatest extent possible, we are recommending that
the weight limits be lowered.&#0160; We have prepared the following table
that compares the existing and proposed weight limits for the three
classes of trucks that can use the structure:</em></p>
<p><em>Design<br />
Vehicle&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Existing<br />
Posted Load<br />
(since January 1, 2008)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Proposed<br />
Posted Load&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Reduction in<br />
Load carrying capacity<br />
Single Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 31 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 19 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Two-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 24 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Three-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 44 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 26 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 41%</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed Traffic Control Order (TCO) recommends a reduction
in gross vehicle weight for the three types of trucks that can travel
on Michigan roadways without special permits.&#0160; They are one, two, and
three-unit trucks.&#0160; A single-unit truck is any truck without a
trailer.&#0160; A single-unit truck can be any number of common vehicles.&#0160;
Some examples of this would be a school or AATA bus, moving van, or in
the worst case, a fully loaded concrete truck.&#0160; A two-unit truck can be
most easily described as a semi-truck with one trailer.&#0160; Note, a
pick-up truck or car pulling an “ordinary” trailer (such as the
trailers that lawn maintenance companies would use) would not be
considered a two-unit vehicle. Finally, a three-unit truck can be most
easily thought of as a semi-truck pulling two trailers.&#0160; An example of
this would be the large sand or gravel hauling trucks that bring
materials to construction sites.</em></p>
<p><em>The recommended gross vehicle weight reductions are
significant.&#0160; Also, the overall condition of the bridge has declined
measurably over the course of the last calendar year.&#0160; We expect that
the condition of the structure will continue to decline as the
structure is nearing the end of its useful life.&#0160; Based on the rate of
deterioration that we have observed over the course of the last few
years, we believe that the structure has approximately three to five
years in which it will be able to carry trucks.&#0160; We also expect that
additional weight limit restrictions will be necessary in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Long-term Actions</em></p>
<p><em>As you may recall, we have begun a project to perform the
preliminary design of the replacement for this structure, as well as
the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.&#0160;
The bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks is located about 300 feet
to the west of the bridge over S. State Street.&#0160; We believe it makes
sense to consider replacing both bridges at the same time, although it
is also possible to replace the two bridge structures at different
times.</em></p>
<p><em>We have not able to move forward on the preliminary design of
the bridge over S. State Street or the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks
because we are waiting for the 4th Ward City Council members to
nominate and confirm a Citizens Advisory Committee to assist us with
the public engagement process.&#0160; It has been our experience with
projects of this nature that it is important to consider and review all
aspects of the proposed design with the citizens in order to make sure
the project that we deliver meets community expectations.&#0160; This process
will also help us to avoid conflicts later in the design process as we
will have already confirmed the design approach and aesthetics of the
project with the public and City Council.&#0160; Finally, this preliminary
design process will allow us to better estimate the cost of the project
based on a more complete picture of all project elements.</em></p>
<p><em>We have estimated that it will take about 2 to 3 years to
prepare for bridge replacement including the public engagement and
internal project review process; the preliminary and final design of
the bridges and needed approach work; and the development of a funding
plan for the project.&#0160; We have prepared a tentative schedule for this
project such that its construction could be started shortly after the
University of Michigan’s Football Stadium Renovations are completed.&#0160;
We are also planning and coordinating this project so that it is
compatible with the planned improvements along W. Stadium Boulevard.&#0160;
Attached, please find a drawing that we have prepared that locates all
of these planned improvements and their anticipated starting and
completion dates.&#0160; Also attached, please find the tentative project
schedule that details the required tasks and estimated durations of the
required activities to complete the project’s design.</em></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p><em>Fortunately, the reduction in weights that we are proposing does
not yet affect most of the everyday users of this structure.&#0160; However,
we believe that when it is again necessary to reduce the posted weight
limits, both AATA and the Ann Arbor Public Schools will be impacted by
this change.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed change will impact the trucking and construction
operations that use this corridor as they, most probably, will not be
able to route trucks through this portion of the E. Stadium Boulevard
corridor between S. Industrial Highway and S. Main Street.&#0160; These types
of trucks will have to find an alternative route around this portion of
E. Stadium Boulevard.</em></p>
<p><em>We are also working with the Communications Office to prepare a
press release notifying the appropriate agencies of the proposed change.</em></p>

to microformats. I can change my mind, and not
have to go back and update a zillion web pages to
reflect that change of mind. Whatever you are
calling &quot;identity&quot; here is emphatically not what

(or onto the financial networks or the astral plane) is a reflection of
you, then in some real sense it is you.
</p><p>I&#39;ll stay very skeptical that by standardizing a microformat that we
can easily update that we can somehow &quot;control our own identity&quot;.
How much of your personal identity (or the data that reflects some
aspect of your personal identity) is really stored on servers and systems
and for that matter on paper beyond your immediate control? After all,
I have a dossier (er, Address Book entry) which you can&#39;t update at
will. If you change names, change jobs, or change ideas about what
your Self is, that&#39;s going to take some time to percolate through The System,
and some parts of it will be unchangable just like the name you never
use now but that people who knew you from when you were little still
call you.</p>

      <p>Here&#39;s some notes about parallel computing, going in two directions at the same time.&#0160; In one direction you have tools like Map/Reduce or Hadoop managing the work of parceling a problem into many pieces and then coordinating the collection of those pieces.&#0160; In another direction you have graphics chips being turned into interesting general purpose parallel computing chips that can do some specific operations very fast.</p><p>It&#39;s mostly in the form of clippings, in part because I don&#39;t have a whole story yet, just the fragments.</p><p>from<a href="http://www.p16blog.com/p16/2008/07/supercomputing-for-the-masses-nvidia-cuda.html"> P16: Practical Progress - Supercomputing for the masses</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One thing CUDA doesn&#39;t provide is a way to manage and process
massive datasets. The cards have somewhat limited memory, and you have
to write an app that runs on the host and feeds the card with data. For
search applications like topic clustering -- which I&#39;d like to use this
for -- CUDA alone doesn&#39;t provide an answer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Perhaps it would make sense eventually to use Hadoop plus CUDA --
write your map/reduce tasks in CUDA, and rely on Hadoop to distribute
data around a cluster of Nvidia-accelerated boxes?</p><p>find23.net -<a href="http://find23.net/2008/12/11/map-reduce-on-gpus/"> Map Reduce on GPUs</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">A fellow at the german hadoop user meeting (Thanks to Isabel that
organized that again) pointed me to the fact that GPUs on a graphic
cards basically working like server grids.<br />
He mentioned there are some research papers in this field. I spend some
time to read through what I could found and it was quite interesting.
Let me citate some of the facts from the two most interesting papers:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">+ “A Map Reduce Framework for Programming Graphics Processors” by
Bryan Catanzaro, Narayanan Sundaram and Kurt Keutzer UC, Berkeley<br />
+ “Mars: A MapReduce Framework on Graphics Processors” by Bingsheng He, Wenbin Fang, Qiong Luo, Naga K. Govindaraju, Tuyong Wang</p><p>and, hiding at the end of a long set of searches, is <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a>, a company</p>
<p class="large" style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>Hadoop</span> is the popular open source
implementation of MapReduce, a powerful tool designed for the detailed
analysis and transformation of very large data sets. Hadoop enables you
to explore complex data in its native form, using custom analyses
tailored to the information and questions you have.</p>
<p class="large blue" style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>Cloudera</span> can help you install, configure and run Hadoop for large-scale data processing and analysis.</p><p>The vision is not a rack of ordinary CPUs using Hadoop to manage them; the vision is a rack of CPU+GPU combinations where you can take advantage of parallelization both between machines and on the machine.</p>

      <p>Every year the U of Michigan teaches a Woody Plants class.&#0160; I didn&#39;t take it when I was in school, but my sister did, and it&#39;s one of these legendary courses that people remember for a long time.</p><p>Here&#39;s the links and notes I could find easily.&#0160; It&#39;s prompted by <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/02/13/where-are-ann-arbors-trees/">the Ann Arbor Chronicle&#39;s story about the city of Ann Arbor tree inventory going on now,</a> which I hope will yield a precise map of where all of the public juneberry trees are.</p><p>Course listing: <a href="http://www.snre.umich.edu/node/349">NRE 436: Woody Plants Biology and Identification</a></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 40px;"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Woody
Plants is an intensive field- and lecture-based learning experience, in
which you will learn to identify 160 trees, shrub and vine species that
are important in Michigan environments. You will learn about their
taxonomy, distribution, habitat associations, and biogeographic history
and how to identify them in their leafless winter condition. The lab
component consists of weekly field trips in the Ann Arbor area, which
include riparian and floodplain habitats, glacial lakes, moraines,
bogs, fens and mesic forests. The lectures cover elementary aspects of
plant identification, taxonomy and ecology; however, the broader themes
include biogeographic history and the assembly of Michigan plant
communities, both before and after major glaciations, ecological
specializiation, and impacts of global warming and other anthropogenic
environmental changes.</font></p><p><br /><a href="http://http://sitemaker.umich.edu/woodyplants/home">Woody Plants - Sitemaker</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The required textbook for Woody Plants is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michigan Trees</span>

      </h3>
      <p>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&#39;re concerned too.</p><p>The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.&#0160; Here&#39;s something like a narrative.</p><p>In the 1969, Jimmy Dean opened a sausage factory in Plainview, TX.&#0160; It closed in 1974, sat idle for 30 years, and then was reopened as a peanut processing plant in 2004.&#0160;&#0160; The best local source for news coverage is the <a href="http://www.myplainview.com/">Plainview Daily Herald</a>, and these clippings are from their online site.</p><p>From the Plainview Daily Herald, 4/15/2004:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jim Booher, who has been involved in food processing for 20 years, is working on opening his third plant and is highly complimentary of the cooperation he´s received here as manager of the Peanut Corporation of America plant. <br /><br />Renovation work is under way on the old Jimmy Dean Meat Co. plant on <br />the west service road of North I-27, adjacent to United Parcel Service. <br />The community landed PCA in December, offering an incentive package <br />which included $390,000 over 10 years with the Plainview-Hale County <br />Industrial Foundation, the City of Plainview and Hale County each <br />putting up $13,000 a year. In-kind work by each entity will be done as <br />well. The package does not include tax abatement. <br /><br />High Plains Millwright of Plainview is handling the demolition work, <br />tearing down some walls, taking out concrete tiers and doing other <br />work before renovation begins. A metal building will be erected on an <br />existing concrete slab and will be connected to the main building. <br />“We hope to be open sometime in August or September, depending on <br />when we get our equipment installed,” said Booher, who is moving here <br />from Grand Prairie.<br /></div><p><br />KCBD, Ch. 11, has a similar story from 4/21/04:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Plainview Peanut Plant to Open this Summer <br />Peanut production in West Texas is growing and <br />that&#39;s why local farmers are excited about the <br />new plant. The plant is undergoing a facelift to <br />make way for 80,000 square feet of peanut <br />processing machinery. &quot;We&#39;re looking at <br />probably within the next three months of <br />putting equipment in and painting and getting <br />ready for operation,&quot; says plant manager, Jim <br />Booher. <br /></div><p><br />The cached copy of the PCA site (since removed) has this to say about the Texas plant:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re Ready NOW, not later! <br />Beginning with the first load of <br />peanuts ever processed at Peanut <br />Corporation&#39;s new Texas plant, our <br />most&#0160; important&#0160; task has been <br />quality.&#0160; We don&#39;t&#0160; request&#0160; your <br />patience while we figure out how to <br />do this. <br />Instead, we request that you hold us <br />to the high standards you&#39;ve always <br />expected from a Peanut Corporation <br />of America plant. We&#39;re ready.&#0160; <br />Pride in Our Newest Plant. Pride in Texas! <br />There couldn&#39;t be a more perfect location than Plainview, <br />Texas for the newest addition to Peanut Corporation&#39;s list of <br />plants! Just off North Interstate 27 in Plainview, we connect <br />the Western and Central&#0160; United States with the Texas <br />Peanut Industry. Texas really is the best state, y&#39;all! <br />&#0160;<br />Blanchers <br />Product Listing <br />Coming soon to this spot: a comprehensive <br />listing of products and services brought to <br />you by Peanut Corporation of America in <br />Plainview, Texas. <br />Until the list is posted, please feel free to <br />contact Jim Booher, our Texas plant&#39;s <br />operations manager for a complete discussion <br />of how we can serve you. <br /></div><p><br />How did Plainview get the plant?&#0160; More from the Daily Herald, Feb 25 2007:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One day,&#0160;Peanut Corporation of America President Stewart Parnell
from Lynchburg, Va., flew&#0160;in for fuel and a visit and happened to
mention that&#0160;he was looking to locate a peanut processing plant in this
area, and Miller directed him to Hale County State Bank President Brian
Pohlmeier, who&#0160;was on the board of the Plainview-Hale County&#0160;Industrial
Board.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">“As it turned out,” said Miller, “Brian had
been&#0160;Parnell’s&#0160;loan officer&#0160;for several of the planes he had bought and
it wound up with the peanut plant locating in the old Jimmy Dean plant.”</p><p>The Sept 1, 2008 Daily Herald has a brief story about the rehab of the plant:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The IDC has issued millions of dollars in revenue bonds to help
businesses in the area, including three bonds in Hale County and four
in Castro County — mainly for dairies, IDC legal representative Malcolm
Tisdel said.</span></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The city and county work hand-in-hand with the IDC and Plainview/Hale County Industrial Foundation to bring in new industry.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Jesus
Garrocho, operations manager at Peanut Corporation of America, said the
IDC was instrumental in bringing the company to Plainview.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>“The
(Peanut Corp.) facility had been empty for 30 years,” Brian Pohlmeier,
president of the IDC, said. “Now it has a business that employees
30-some people.”</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Together, the Industrial Foundation and IDC
have contributed substantial economic impact to the area. The IDC helps
not only Hale County but surrounding counties as well.</span></div><p><br />There&#39;s more from the 10/29/2003 Daily Herald:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The inducement package being offered Peanut Corp. calls for the
city, county and Plainview-Hale County Industrial Foundation to
contribute $100,000 each in $10,000 increments over a 10-year span. It
also calls for paving the parking lot of the plant and installing a
special water line for firefighting purposes.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The county approved the proposal Monday and the industrial foundation board was expected to do so today.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
In return for the incentives, the plant ­ which will process shelled
and cleaned peanuts into candy and food products ­ is expected to hire
an initial batch of 35 employees, process 256,000 pounds of nuts daily
and ultimately invest $1 million in the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> “If they pull
out, we don´t pay the ($10,000) installments,” industrial foundation
Executive Director Grady Elder said in outlining the proposal at
Monday´s Commissioners Court meeting.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The plant closed in 1974. The building is owned by Ronald Thompson of Lubbock. </p><p>I don&#39;t know what a sausage factory that has been idle for 30 years looks like, and how much it takes to rehab it to the point where it&#39;s ready to clean peanuts for use in candy.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/">Mark Forster has a new productivity system which he calls Autofocus.&#0160;</a> There&#39;s the obligatory blog, video, twitter account, glowing Lifehacker review etc etc.&#0160; If you care, you&#39;ll look them up.</p><p>Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&#39;re working on.&#0160; Rather that giving tasks tags, categories, priorities, precedence, importance, geographic location, or anything else, you simply step through your list one page at a time.&#0160; To decide what to do next you contemplate all of the unsolved tasks on that page, and when one of them jumps out at you, you do it.</p><p>The page at a time approach ensures that you don&#39;t spend all your time in contemplation and that there&#39;s a finite and shrinking list of things to contemplate.&#0160; The lack of explicit sorting means that you can engage in constructive procrastination to do something that needs to be done without feeling bad that the thing that has to be done is delayed.&#0160; And the lack of tags etc. means that the cognitive overhead of keeping track of how you make a decision goes away - you just pick something and do it.</p><p>(One more piece of this that I haven&#39;t done yet is the algorithm for deciding what not to do; apparently if you look at a page and nothing jumps out at you, you are to cross off everything on the page and not do them.&#0160; And doing something partially is OK, you mark it off on the old page and re-enter it on the new page.)</p><p>I have a weakness for new systems, if only because learning a new system means that you apply a new filter to the same old things that have been postponed for too long and you get a new way to handle a burst of attention.&#0160; This one works well on paper and works with the reporter-style pocket notebook I&#39;m using.&#0160; </p><p>I&#39;ve used similar approaches before to exploring big problem sets - if you divide the whole set into small and manageable pieces, and do something useful with each of those pieces, then you can get through a lot without trying to optimize every decision.&#0160; It works, for instance, as the strategy for picking out some new books to read from a library new bookshelf, just go one shelf at a time and pick something that catches your eye from each shelf.&#0160; You can get through a lot that way - it won&#39;t be everything, and it won&#39;t be exhaustive, but the throughput in a system where lots of decisions are easy and lots of alternatives are exposed can be good.</p>

Questions about <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> things run the way they do. <span style="font-style: italic;">Questions</span> about whether things could run better. <span style="font-style: italic;">Critiques</span> about the schools. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ideas</span>
to improve them. And--in general--I believe that most of the staff
wants the schools to work. But for whom? Are we teaching to the masses?
To the top 10%? The bottom 10%? And are we succeeding? Anyway, what
does it mean to succeed?<br /><br />In addition, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ann Arbor News</span> shrinks its coverage of everything (except maybe sports--which are important too), <span style="font-weight: bold;">we are not getting the news we need about the schools</span>. I believe that <span style="font-weight: bold;">these are our schools</span>--yes,
the taxpayers--and we need to know what is going on. These are our
schools--yes, the parents--and we need to be able to make decisions for
our kids. These are our schools--yes, the staff--who often don&#39;t have a
voice in decisions. These are our schools--yes, the students--and what
students think also matters.<br /></div><p><br />The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/boe_home">Ann Arbor Public Schools are run by an elected Board of Education; their web site</a> has some information about how that public body operates.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.0809/home">board calendar</a> for 2008-2009 has a schedule of public meetings, and includes links to the packets of information that have been assembled for the board to review for each meeting.&#0160; You may find them dry reading; you may find them hard to get through; you might find them slow to download, because the one I picked up with 64 pages and 4.4 megabytes, mostly of newspaper clippings from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; If you have comments, there are <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/rules_for_public_commentary">rules for public commentary at the board meetings</a>, which appear to be well elaborated to deal with any number of issues that arise.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The days of quickly flashing your MCard to ride an Ann Arbor bus will soon be gone.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To cut down on the use of expired MCards, the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority will require all pass holders, including
current yellow MCard holders, to swipe their cards through an updated
fare box on all fixed route buses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The change will take effect Feb. 16.</p><p>Note that any delays on boarding will affect on-time performance of routes that serve the University.&#0160; Some of those buses run very full at peak hours, and so you should watch for indicators of worse on-time performance for those routes when lots of U of Michigan passengers get on and off.</p><p>As a point of contrast, the U of Michigan buses don&#39;t require any ID or fares when boarding; their cost per bus-hour is in the $55/hr range, compared with AATA&#39;s $100/hr or so.&#0160; Those are not apples to apples comparisons, but certainly the faster you can board a bus full the less bus-hours you spend waiting at the curb and the more bus-hours you can spend getting from place to place.</p>

opinions on Kennecott&rsquo;s plans to re-open the old Humboldt Mill at a
public meeting hosted by Michigan&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Kennecott Minerals bought the property last September with plans to
process ore from its proposed Eagle Project. Without legal permits to
develop Eagle, the company continues to push permits for this
processing facility, which was not part of the original mine plan.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Department of Environmental Quality would have to approve
Kennecott&rsquo;s application before the company could reopen the facility.
The meeting schedule is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Location:</strong> Humboldt Township Hall</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Directions:</strong> Hwy 41 to M95. M95 south, 1 block, turn west on County Road FA.
