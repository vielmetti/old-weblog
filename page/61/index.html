        <p>When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.
As a small public service, the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-08-jesusita-fire-in-santa-barbara-ca-in-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-07-i-am-not-an-information-activist-or-a-civic-minded-data-freak-thank-you-very-much/">&raquo;</a></p>

An April 15 story from the AP notes that the bankruptcy filing has gone through in Dayton, OH (via the Newark Advocate): <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-01-ann-arbor-gold-gift-certificates-being-redeemed-by-the-ann-arbor-area-chamber-certifichecks-chapter-/">&raquo;</a></p>
