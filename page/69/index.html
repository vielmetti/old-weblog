<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-12-bunny-biscuit-b/">bunny biscuit brief</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn't find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;bunny cutter&quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference.&nbsp; You should be able to find these things everywhere once Easter rolls around; just in case you can't for some reason, <a href="http://www.shopbakersnook.com/221.html">here's a good sized selection for sale.</a></p>

<p>I'll note, just for my own embarrassment, two things about this recipe.&nbsp; First, though it calls for some baking soda, you would be foolish to do (as I did exactly one time) to use exclusively baking soda instead of baking powder as measured; bleah is all I need to say.&nbsp; Second, though it calls for 5 Tbsp of oil, I can say from somewhat sheepish experience that it will also work with no oil, and still tasted pretty good.</p>

<p>Bunny biscuits are usually on the menu when we make soup; this week's soup was a &quot;white beans and whatever else was around&quot; assembly, which turned out pretty good.&nbsp; It's hard not to have a good soup when you have so many good tomatoes.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Do first before your hands get sticky: Take out ingredients, measuring
cups, cookie sheet fork, measuring spoons, bunny cutter, sheet of wax
paper.&nbsp; Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</p>

<p>
In big metal mixing bowl measure:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup whole wheat flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup white flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 tsp baking powder<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp baking soda<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp salt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Tbsp sugar</p>

<p>
Mix all this up with a fork.</p>

<p>
Add:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 Tbsp canola oil</p>

<p>
Mix again with a fork.</p>

<p>
In the 1c glass measuring cup, mix (approx):<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup yogurt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup milk</p>

<p>
Stir until it's uniform.</p>

<p>
Add to metal mixing bowl.&nbsp; Mix with fork until it's a more or less
uniform consistency. Put wax paper on a big surface and coat with
flour.&nbsp; Turn out dough, knead ten times.&nbsp; Pat out until .75&quot; thick.
 Cut out biscuits, handling as little as possible.&nbsp; Place on ungreased
cookie sheet, bake 12 minutes, remove immediately.</p>

<p>
Mwah!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Merlin Mann has relaunched <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>; he doesn't want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&nbsp; It's a good choice.</p>

<p>He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish.&nbsp; (Or something like that; it probably overstates the issue.)&nbsp; And he bemoans the tendency of people to consume an endless stream of shitty first drafts as if that was the only thing worth doing:</p><blockquote><p>What worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of
fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of <em>everything</em>.
I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of
it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.&nbsp; (from <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better">better)</a></p></blockquote><p>Since this post itself is a shitty first draft of a summary of what is probably 100 other things I've thought about, I'll keep it short.&nbsp; Sometimes, when you want to have deep insight into a topic, you have to immerse yourself in the details.&nbsp; Your makebelieve insight and fake-connectedness are exercises in helping you understand the world, and even though sometimes the explanation that comes up doesn't really sound any more insightful than what your wikipedia-quoting eight year old can come up with, it came from you.&nbsp; Sometimes, if you are really lucky, you get to reflect on a bunch of first drafts and turn them into second and third drafts - hurray!&nbsp; But at least you got that thinking out into public in a format that can get some feedback.&nbsp; The best way to have one good idea is to have a thousand ideas.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">Clinical reminder systems</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of a series on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems">reminder systems.</a></p>

<p>--</p>

<p>One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head.</p>

<p>As an example of this (not the only example), there is a system developed at the University of Michigan called ClinfoTracker.&nbsp; &nbsp;It uses information from patient healthcare records to remind patients and medical staff of expected upcoming dates for appointments and tests, and to remind doctors that if a test has not been completed that they should re-request it.&nbsp; This complex data and protocol driven reminder scheduling is way beyond the postcard you get from your dentist, and as such it can provide some considerable addition support in working with people who may not remember all of the things that need to happen in the future.&nbsp; Quoting now <a href="http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=609">from a press release from the UMHS</a>:</p><blockquote><div>“We felt there was a need to develop a reminder and tracking
system that could be generalized in very distinct, diverse practices.
We found the ClinfoTracker system could fit relatively easily into
routine patient care flow and was easy to implement into a practice,”
says study author Donald Nease, M.D., associate professor of <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/fammed/">family medicine </a>at the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/medschool/">U-M Medical School </a>and co-creator of ClinfoTracker.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The greatest improvements in screening rates occurred at practices
that were more technologically savvy and practices where employees were
more adaptable and worked well together.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Initially, ClinfoTracker was developed to help doctors track
patients’ clinical problems and preventive care over time. The software
can also assist with chronic care, such as diabetes testing, as well as
with cancer screenings and other routine tests.</div></blockquote>



<p><a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/clinfotracker/home">The ClinfoTracker site describes the operation at the clinical level:</a></p><blockquote><p>Specifically, Cielo Clinic provides the clinician with a one sheet
clinical summary (Encounter Form) that includes chronic and active
problems, and needed services. Services that a patient might be
eligible for are based on their age, gender and/or clinical problems.
Following the principle that clinicians should only be prompted when
necessary, prior to the visit, Clinic scans billing, lab and radiology
databases to determine if an eligible service is up to date. If it is,
clinicians are not prompted to perform it.
</p>

<p>During the patient visit, the clinician markes updates to the
problem list on the Encounter Form, and checks the appropriate boxes
next to the prompted services. Services may be marked as having been
&quot;Done&quot;, &quot;Discussed&quot;, &quot;Ordered&quot;, &quot;Patient refused&quot;, &quot;Not a candidate&quot;,
or &quot;Not addressed.&quot; In this way, clinicians have flexibility in
indicating how the prompt has been addressed, or whether the prompt is
appropriate. For example, &quot;Not a candidate&quot; might be checked for a
patient that is flagged as needing a pap smear, but has had a
hysterectomy. This removes the prompt. A &quot;Patient refused&quot; check
removes the prompt for one year.</p></blockquote><p>The U of Michigan system is one of several such systems that use the phrase &quot;clinical reminder system&quot;.&nbsp; Some others include:</p>

<p><a href="http://crs.heinz.cmu.edu/">The Clinical Reminder System</a> is a project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and the West Penn Allegheny Health System:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">The Clinical 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reminder System is a prototype Decision Support System that combines a 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;relational database, a knowledge base consisting of algorithms that 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;implement disease management guidelines, integration with hospital 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;information systems and a web-based interface allowing for physician 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;management of patient data and suggested medical responses. It is a joint 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;research project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and The 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Department of Medicine at The West Penn Allegheny Health System. This 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;application has been in use within a clinical setting since 2001.</span></p></blockquote><p>There is a similar system in place at the VA hospitals; here's<a href="http://www.jamia.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/438"> a review showing barriers to adoption: (Saleem and Asch, 2005)</a></p><blockquote><p>Optimally using the CR system for its intended purpose<sup>&nbsp;</sup>was impeded by (1) lack of coordination between nurses and providers;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(2) using the reminders while not with the patient, impairing<sup>&nbsp;</sup>data acquisition and/or implementation of recommended actions;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(3) workload; (4) lack of CR flexibility; and (5) poor interface<sup>&nbsp;</sup>usability. Facilitators included (1) limiting the number of<sup>&nbsp;</sup>reminders at a site; (2) strategic location of the computer<sup>&nbsp;</sup>workstations; (3) integration of reminders into workflow; and<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(4) the ability to document system problems and receive prompt<sup>&nbsp;</sup>administrator feedback.</p></blockquote><p>This set of tools uses &quot;reminder system&quot; as a part of a &quot;decision support system&quot; (both of which are lovely sets of words with a bunch of coded history and software tied around them).</p>

<p>One good contact in the Ann Arbor area is <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=kzheng">Kai Zheng</a> who teaches a course, <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/caid/display_course.cfm?CourseID=HMP668">Introduction to Health Informatics</a>, which covers this and other topics.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">Blogger&#39;s secret: don&#39;t feed the trolls</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.</p>

<p>This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page.</p>

<p>On the spam fighting front, your choice of platform matters a lot.&nbsp; I've been happy with Typepad's service, though it lets a few things go by the admin tools make it possible to unpublish something fairly quickly.&nbsp; People using Wordpress use its default Akismet tool with good success.&nbsp; If your comment tool doesn't aggressively screen for spam, you need a better system.&nbsp; In many cases, Trackback is a source of spam as well; I ended up completely blocking that just to save the hassle.</p>

<p>There's a huge and messy market in fake comments, helped by systems like Amazon's Mechanical Turk that anonymize the payments for them.&nbsp; Every so often the fake commenter actually has something marginally interesting to say, so I tend to let those through but rewrite the target URL of their post to remove the commercial value from it.&nbsp; Life is too short to live with commenter bots.</p>

<p>When on the odd chance that you have an angry, abusive critic aimed at you - the sort of person who would scribble profanities or spew personal attacks - the only reasonable remedy is to remove the text.&nbsp; Ideally, you do that without acknowledging it, or if it's important for context to keep some fragment of it around, a traditional method is to edit the text to make it semi-legible e.g. by removing the vwls or st*rr*ng th* ess*nt**l p*rts **t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let the critics and nastygrams find their own site, and force their authors out into the open.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One of the reasons that blogs emerged from the Internet primordial soup in the late 1990s was that Usenet had degenerated into spam, fake posts, and abuse; by holding the discussion on a web page you control, you could start to control it.&nbsp; &nbsp;That makes the world a little bit harder to follow when discussions fly around, but in exchange you get to be not just author but (critically) also editor of your own publication.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-08-reminder-system/">Reminder systems, a survey and overview</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of what I hope will be a series of posts, and with that I hope some publishable output at the end; my guess is that if I write about this a dozen times I'll have 1800 publishable words on the topic when I'm done.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quick word check on the search engine shows up 400000+ uses of the term, and a handful of ads, which suggests that's a common phrase; you'll also see &quot;reminder services&quot;, &quot;appointments reminder&quot;, &quot;meetings reminder&quot;, and a zillion others.&nbsp; So this is not new ground, not by any means.</p>

<p>The particular chunk of this space I am interested in is the &quot;note to future self&quot;; the message that you send to yourself in the future to do or think of something, which comes to you as a message in some way.&nbsp; Think of it as a time capsule that you open, or a package that you had forgotten and then reopened; some part of it will hopefully be novel and trigger some &quot;that's easy&quot; reaction rather than the &quot;oh blah I still can't figure out how to do that&quot;.</p>

<p>My future self is a lot more capable than I am, as witnessed by all of the promises that my current self makes for my future self to do.&nbsp; Sometimes these are things which sound easy in the instant but actually prove hard in the future; others are things which my current self has figured out in essence but just hasn't worked through in detail, and thus it needs a little nudge to push it back to that memory of how to solve it.&nbsp; It always helps to have some sleep on problems.</p>

<p>So we remind ourselves.&nbsp; We put notes on the door, post things on the fridge, leave out the shoes on the steps so that they go to the shoemakers, paste sticky notes on our laptops.&nbsp; Elaborate tickler systems send us to the stores to buy forty three color coded folders, which get cut up and used by our children for craft projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;Facebook tells us about our friends birthdays, but not quite in enough time to send them postcards; our dentist and insurance agent seem to be the most regular, if boring correspondents.</p>

<p>I'll collect the various systems I've used, am using, or gave up on in this category; there are some in the previous &quot;Calendars&quot; section which I'll mine for ideas.&nbsp; </p>

fruit that hardly anyone knows about. The first time I had one it

plenty of sugar and a little vanilla. We should be able to get the

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; with &quot;road kill&quot; to stimulate visits to their
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; patches by the carrion flies.&nbsp; (They hang used buckets

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason I can surmise the carrion fly link to paw paw pollination
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; is that in more wild areas of the western Appalachians paw
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; paw is a common lowland speicies, especially along
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; streams......and...

<p><div>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Paw paw is one of the first trees to flower in the spring.&nbsp; There
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are few insects generally around at that time of year because
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a frost can take place at almost any time and pollinator numbers
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are severely limited.&nbsp; Carrion flies feeding on dead animals
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; that often comprise a portion of streamside detritus
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; accumulated during winter and spring freshets would certainly
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; make some sort of sense, especially during the midst of the first
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; few warm days of spring.

      <p>This recipe is much too easy this time of year when tomatoes are in abundance and taste great; don't even think of doing it with winter styrofoam tomatoes.</p>

<p>Sauce:</p>

<p>A little olive oil<br />Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller<br />Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a pan.&nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don't bother to skin or peel or seed them.&nbsp; Sprinkle on basil.</p>

<p>Cook, uncovered, over low heat until the tomatoes are cooked down into a sauce (but not so much that it's a paste).</p>

<p>Serve with anelletti - Trader Joe's has it right now - or some other similar small pasta like baby shells.</p>

<p>I fried a few sliced mushrooms and chopped onions in a little olive oil and added them to mine, but the boys preferred just tomato sauce, perhaps with a little grated cheese.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of an occasional &quot;blogger's secret&quot; series.</p>

<p>Write for yourself. Really, you are best off with an audience of one
to start, and use your time and effort to write down things that you
will want to read in a week or a month or a year. If you are
interesting to your audience of one, you have some hope of being
interesting to some other person somewhere else on the planet who is
interested in you. Tip: If you have already writtten something
somewhere on the net that you're proud of, repurpose it or reprint it
in your blog; that can get you off to a good start.</p>

<p>As an adjunct to this, you can use scheduled reminder services to nudge you in the right direction and remind you about things you might want to remember in the future.&nbsp; So write that note to your future self, and then publish a pointer to in in the future, so that you'll see it again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging.</p>

<p>If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.</p>

<p>Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG.</p>

<p>If you're doing your homework, you should be able to do homework for your readers. Find a popular search term that's driving traffic to an existing page, identify an alternate database with better resources than what a simple Google search will unearth, and add to your existing copy. I find Google Books to be a good source, especially for pre-1922 materials which give some historical perspective on the matter. Amazon and your favorite library are good book reference sources. Thousands of other databases have awful user interfaces and hidden away content which can be selectively referenced for good effect.</p>

<p>This is neatly summarized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller_(social_epistemologist)">Steve Fuller</a> in his 2001 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Management-Foundations-KMCI-Press/dp/0750673656">Knowledge management foundations</a> </p>

<p><blockquote><p>Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.</p></blockquote><p>and thus as a blogger you have an opportunity to pull from one unfamiliar expert system into a familiar non-expert system.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging.</p>

<p>The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic.</p>

<p>By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things.</p>

<p>For instance, this afternoon's traffic included this query:</p>

<p>14:04
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=prices of pumpkins" target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=prices%20of%20pumpkins">Google Search:&nbsp; prices of pumpkins</a></p>

<p>which reminds me that Halloween is right around the corner, and that it's time to check out the pumpkin crop and locate a source for this year.</p>

<p>When someone says to you that they won't write about or invest in topics that have limited &quot;shelf life&quot; - the annual outhouse races, the chicken broil, the first tomato, football parking, the opening day of deer season - smile and know that those one time events happen every year and if you ever write something reasonable about it you'll start getting repeat visits next year.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Whenever the power goes out, there's a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on.</p>

<p>Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what's going on - there's a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.&nbsp; With hurricanes on their way, and dozens of different electric companies dealing with possible problems, it looked like a mess.&nbsp; So I made a map.</p>

<iframe width="425" scrolling="no" height="350" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;s=AARTsJp0kTd9LVAlt2TXywCOVrI94rIX_g&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113932165856461159137.000455fd4a9e930f6b943&amp;ll=36.668419,-83.935547&amp;spn=24.587157,37.353516&amp;z=4&amp;output=embed"> </iframe>

</p>

<p>This map (incomplete now; notably missing the west coast and new england) has regions corresponding to power company service areas, more or less, and links from those regions direct to the outage reporting page.&nbsp; It's a hack - you'd love something lovely which really put all of the live data on one page - but you live with the infrastructure you have, not the infrastructure you want to have.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>As I said a bunch of vendors are working on these sorts of tools; here's a review of sorts.</p>

<p>The shiniest and nicest so far appears to be <a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com">iFactor</a>, which handles mapping for Con Edison (NYC), Progress Energy (Fla), Nebraska Public Power District and Entergy (New Orleans). The New Orleans system has had a tremendous workout with Gustav, and at some point the crush of queries made them take it offline; it went back online with limited information (ie. the utility doesn't know when things are going to be online again so that part of the system is disabled).&nbsp; They are using Microsoft Virtual Earth for their base maps.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">Gustav: social media lessons being learned</a>
      </h3>
      <p>While it's still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net's response to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; I'm not putting a lot of links in this post.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter looked like an actual help here for the folks I knew, both to help let others know where they were going (or whether they were staying) and to help make the evacuation process somewhat less isolating.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Evacuation path: Those who left relatively early had relatively easier driving; by the time evacuation was underway in earnest the traffic jams were huge, some gas stations were temporarily out of gas, and the contraflow caused a lot of congestion when it ended.&nbsp; Twitter again seemed to be useful to help people figure out which non-Interstate highways looked like reasonable exit paths, or at least if it wasn't useful at that moment it was something to file away for next time.</p>

<p>Lodging and companionship when you arrive: Here the contrasts associated with poverty and access to resources are the starkest.&nbsp; Those with means to leave early and drive far arrived to empty shelters, and people eager to help; those who went somewhat off the beaten path, and knew where they were going, found their choice of hotel rooms; those who evacuated late and didn't go very far found themselves in crowded shelters right in the hurricane's path.&nbsp; There were stories of Labor Day reunions with family that had left during Katrina for another city and never came back, and more than one account of people who evacuated to their previous Katrina evac destination.</p>

<p>Keeping track of things back home: New Orleans was out of the worst of the storm, and a cadre of well connected people stayed behind, and as a result there's been detailed reporting on status down to which bars are open and who has power (even though the Entergy site is only reporting aggregate numbers at the parish level).&nbsp; Other places had it much worse, with Baton Rouge the biggest loser, getting a substantial storm hit and a lot of NOLA refugees in shelters and really bad power and telephone recovery.&nbsp; I don't (personally) have as connected a Baton Rouge network as I do a New Orleans network, so it feels second hand and isolated.</p>

<p>Decision to return:&nbsp; This is a complicated set of decisions as of yet not completely played out, and really the next question.&nbsp; If I return home, will there be flooding on the way?&nbsp; Will the power be on?&nbsp; Will I have phone service, will the toilets work, will there be good drinking water, will I get stopped on my way home and then stuck?&nbsp; If I don't go home, can I afford the hotel stay?&nbsp; </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>The other question you have to ask, of course, is whether the Internet has been helpful for 2 million people, or just for 200 who are super well connected.</p>

<p>The OnStar service announced how much health and welfare traffic it took during Gustav, and how helpful it was to have trained professional staff on the other end of the phone line to help people during an evacuation - to find hotel rooms, to give driving directions, to be calm.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Various &quot;social media projects&quot; sprung up to coordinate information, but the real winner in the wild appears to be radio (in particular <a href="http://twitter.com/mpronline">Mississippi Public Radio</a>), which can reach people right close by even if their phone is out of battery or out of service.</p>

<p>CNN was broadcasting live (!1!1!) using Twitter to get real time feedback from people - how much of that is just the nature of broadcast news to seize on new technology, and how much is it some fundamental change in how reporting is done in the middle of a disaster.</p>

<p>The test, I'm sure, happens not this week or next but months or years from now as Houma, LA is rebuilt or when Pineville, LA and Alexandria, LA once again have clean running water.&nbsp; There's some disappointment in that the reaction has been &quot;it missed New Orleans, no problems&quot;, when that's so clearly not the case.</p>

      <p>This blog loads very, very slowly.&nbsp; (Sorry.)&nbsp; It's big, it's full of weird crap that I like to post because it's interesting, and sometimes things break because the weird crap is no longer supported.</p>

<p>If you want it to go faster look at this:</p><blockquote><p>Steve Souders book High Performance Web Sites describes the 14 best
practices he developed while working as the Chief Performance Yahoo!.
YSlow, the Firebug extension he created, codified those best practices.
Now working at Google, Steve discusses the next set of best practices
he's discovered, including the impact of iframes and where to place
(and where not to place) inline script blocks. </p></blockquote><p>and it you want to understand why web sites that are faster are better, more profitable, and more helpful for users see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596515081/?tag=superpatron-20">Andy King's Web Site Optimization</a> </p><blockquote><p>Fast display speed is the key to success with your website. It
increases profits, decreases costs, and improves customer satisfaction
(not to mention search engine rankings, accessibility, and
maintainability).
</p></blockquote><p>Here's Steve Souders talk at Google.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-26-google-adsense/">Google AdSense in professional association wikis</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Google's AdSense program is designed to provide relevant targeted advertising content to web pages.&nbsp; It works, sometimes intermittently, on weblogs - but there's often enough other non-relevant things on the design of those pages to work only indifferently.&nbsp; What you do find however is that the appropriately targeted wiki design - especially one where the subject matter expertise of a professional association is involved, and where the words in use a specific to a field of specialty - yields extremely targeted results.</p>

<p>Caution is worthwhile, however, because for every well-targeted advertising stripe you get the occasional horrible, unprofessional blunder.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some cases in point.</p>

<p><a href="http://quimica.wikispaces.com/">Quimica from the American Chemical Society</a> is running this ad on page one, hosted on Wikispaces:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/26/picture_8.png" title="Picture_8" alt="Picture_8" />


<br />Now ask yourself, what is to blame here?&nbsp; There are three ways that you can fix a problem like this of having inappropriate advertising running in your wiki.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Don't run advertising at all.&nbsp; Host your wiki yourself, or host it somewhere with an option to turn off advertising.&nbsp; Remove the risk of the accidental inappropriate Adwords ad by not using Adwords as an ad network.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Sell advertising in-house as sponsorships, or run house ads in the stripe of the page normally designed for external advertising.&nbsp; This might very reasonably be ads for things like upcoming association events, membership benefits, or other details that look like advertising targeted straight at your members.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; Use the Google AdSense ad quality as a measure of the relevance of the pages you have, and edit the wiki until the junk ads don't show up.&nbsp; Block advertisers that are inappropriate, remove page text that triggers inappropriate ads, and otherwise optimize for relevance, professionalism, and revenue.&nbsp; This works best when you are hosting a wiki on a platform and get the revenues for the advertising - some &quot;free&quot; wiki hosting really is paid for by click-throughs on ads that you are running, and if your association members are using Google Adwords to promote themselves they may well be running ads that would be very relevant on your site.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Use Google AdSense quality as a quality check on the professionalism of the AdWords advertising that your association members are running.&nbsp; From time to time, advertising copy writers at agencies will write ads that are completely inappropriate because of regulation or professional standards that they are blissfully unaware of, and by having a spot which attracts these ads you can build in feedback for professional ethics.</p>

<p>It travels round the sun<br />

You can’t flee Mercury in retrograde</p>
<p>You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury</p>
<p>It’s ten times worse than a full moon<br />
You’re not even safe in your bedroom<br />
Controls more than the rising tides<br />
There’s nowhere to hide<br />
There’s nowhere to hide</p>
<p>The gods must be against me<br />
My shortwave doesn’t work<br />
Lost signal, no connection<br />
Nothing goes right</p>
<p>Imbalance in the system<br />
Rogue planet off its track<br />
All circuits overloaded<br />
Nothing goes right</p>
<p>Damn that planet<br />
Damn that star<br />
Force of disruption from afar<br />
You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury</p>
<p>Free from Mercury<br />
Free from Mercury</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-how-do-you-keep/">How do you keep your calendar?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week's a2b3 meeting.&nbsp; Here are some things people shared.</p>

<p>Many people were using <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school.</p>

<p>Several of the people who used calendars to publish events for the general public talked about using an embedded Google Calendar in their blog as a quick and efficient way to share information and keep it up to date, like this one:</p>

<iframe width="400" scrolling="no" height="400" frameborder="0" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?title=a2b3%20&amp;showNav=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=400&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=8d9lpkmgltprmtbkv8p0tr39co%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York" style="border-width: 0pt;"> </iframe>

<p>A possible downside to the plethora of Google calendars is that there are literally half a dozen different otherwise indistinguishable versions of e.g. the Michigan Football schedule online, none of which can be trusted to reliably get game times right (or at least I haven't found any way to predict which one will work the best).</p>

<p>Of the non-Google online calendars, <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Calendar</a> got a vote as a family calendar, and someone was looking at <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra.</a> </p>

<p>On the work side of things, most people who were dealing with calendar systems mentioned Outlook at least once, not always with warmth and fuzziness.&nbsp; One person had Lotus Notes running, an excellent corporate calendar but one that refuses to sync or share.</p>

<p>Those people doing project management had a bias towards Microsoft Excel as a way to keep track of shared expectations about details, and one Microsoft Project user was in the room.</p>

<p>A relatively large number of people had positive things to say about synchronization of calendars to their mobile phone, more than I would have expected.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hsgconsultingllc.com/?p=86">Helene Gidley did a nice roundup of mobile device calendar syncing</a> which hits some of the high points; there's more than one way to do it, and some of them cost money.</p>

<p>Someone noted that they use <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a> to sync everything, and that everything more or less just works, and that this was remarkable enough that everything worked to make it a surprise.</p>

<p>Several people were using paper calendars as their primary daily calendar, either as a standalone calendar, a day planner style book, or a Moleskine as a GTD style capture device that got turned into calendar entries once a day.</p>

<p>I was one of two people who used a personal wiki as a diary style calendar (I use Socialtext, the other person uses Mediawiki, both set up in private one-person-wiki mode).</p>

<p>The universal shared paper calendar was the fridge calendar - if anyone wants to build a high tech fridge, just do the calendar application for it.&nbsp; This was the place where the family negotiated events and scheduling and changes and handoffs and other important timing efforts.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A friend of mine advised living a life simple enough that you could keep track of all of it on a single piece of paper; not quite there yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-coping-with-com/">Coping with community growth</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/a2b3">The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents</a> had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need.</p>

<p>The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you cope with community growth?&nbsp; In particular, if you have an organization that has regular meetings and it outstrips the capabilities of its venue, what do you do to keep it going?&nbsp; Some ideas.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Hold the meeting more frequently.&nbsp; If the monthly meeting is full every time, do a second event on alternate weeks.&nbsp; This is what movie theaters do with popular films (matinees, midnight films, 10a showings) or what busy religious congregations do.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Move the meeting from place to place.&nbsp; Some people will come if it's convenient enough, so if you move from place to place you'll get a variety of people attending who wouldn't otherwise because it's incrementally less convenient.&nbsp; <a href="http://motorcityconnect.collectivex.com/main/summary">Motor City Connect has ten meetings in eight cities around the Detroit area every month,</a> with the idea that it's going to be somewhere close to you some time.</p>

<p>3. Let the group subdivide laterally, with some part of the original collection of people doing something related at a different place and a different time.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microcoworking.com">The a2b3 group spawned (in some sense) the microcoworking group</a>, which started with one day and has expanded to three days at three different locations.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Raise the bar for participation, so that your community grows more slowly.&nbsp; At an extreme, you get new member initiation rituals that approach hazing, and so anyone who wants to stick around really wants to stick around; at the extreme, this coupled with no new member recruitment gives you groups that stop growing and start to grow old with the same people there every time.</p>

<p>5. Grow into different forms, e.g. take an offline group and put it online, or take an online group on one community platform and add it to another community platform.&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 has a very strong and functional mailing list,</a> so people don't have to be at the meetings to post a job offering or get bike repair recommendations or locate a trusted network security auditor (to give but three examples).</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; Use one group to bootstrap the creation of a new group, and then pull your energy out of the first group.&nbsp; In a religious setting this would be a <a href="http://www.joyfulheart.com/plant/splinter.htm">splinter church</a>, and just by that very name you get some sense at some possible social friction that would result.&nbsp; </p>

<p>7.&nbsp; Move your focus from local groups to national or global ones, and grow a community of practice globally rather than just locally.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?wiki_wednesdays">Wiki Wednesday meets on the first Wednesday of the month worldwide</a>; the <a href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/">Web Analytics Wednesday group</a> coordinates Wednesday meetings worldwide.&nbsp; The local meeting is probably still local, but it's part of a bigger world.</p>

<p>Some of these growth strategies yield more managable growth; others recognize that groups might just reach a happy steady state where you don't really want to multiply your size.&nbsp; </p>
