<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the land of Hiawatha,<br />
Where the white man gazed with awe<br />
At a paradise divided<br />
By the straits of Mackinac</p>

<p>Men are dredging, drilling, blasting,<br />
Battling tides around the clock,<br />
Through the depths of icy water,<br />
Driving caissons down to rock.</p>

<p>Fleets of freighters bring their cargoes<br />
From the forges and the kilns;<br />
Stones and steel - ten thousand barge-loads -<br />
From the quarries, mines, and mills.</p>

<p>Now the towers, mounting skyward,<br />
Reach the heights of airy space.<br />
Hear the rivet-hammers ringing,<br />
Joining steel in strength and grace.</p>

<p>High above the swirling currents,<br />
Parabolic strands are strung;<br />
From the cables, packed with power,<br />
Wonder-spans of steel are hung.</p>

<p>Generations dreamed the crossing;<br />
Doubters shook their heads in scorn.<br />
Brave men vowed that they would build it -<br />
From their faith a bridge was born.</p>

<p>There it spans the miles of water,<br />
Speeding millions on their way - <br />
Bridge of vision, hope and courage,<br />
Portal to a brighter day.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>     <br />
Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br />
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.<br />
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br />
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br />
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br />
Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br />
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br />
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br />
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br />
Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br />
Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br />
We trekked and picked until the cans were full,<br />
Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br />
With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br />
Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br />
With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.</p>

<p>We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br />
But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br />
A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br />
The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br />
The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br />
I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br />
That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br />
Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not. </p>

      <p><a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">What is Discardia?</a></p>

<blockquote>
Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas you no longer need. It's about letting go, abdicating from obligation and guilt, being true to the self you are now. Discardia is the time to get rid of things that no longer add value to your life, shed bad habits, let go of emotional baggage and generally lighten your load. - Dinah Sanders
</blockquote>

<p>Discardia was the theme of today's <a href="http://twitter.com/a2b3">a2b3</a> Thursday lunch.</p>

<p>We talked of family emptying years of accumulation as their inheritances, including removing acres of scrap metal from a farm, organizing two day long estate sales, auctioning old books off by the case, and dealing with the environmental impact of 200 old tires.  Some of that meant quite a bit of money and some family bonding time; others of it was stories of incredible hassles.</p>

<p>Balancing that, of course, was the urge to collect, whether it be <a href="http://potifos.com/fraud/">Nigerian fraud email</a>, <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/349434750/in/pool-fairydoors">fairy door drawing from your kids</a>, <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/superpatron">books you've read or would like to read</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/vielmetti/annarbor">web pages about Ann Arbor</a>, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/05/my_quadrille_no.html">handwritten notebooks</a>, <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/">online notebooks</a>, or any of the things in the physical world.  Physical world stuff - tools, two-by-four remnants, scrap metal, pig-themed trinkets, fish-themed trinkets, books, books, more books, paper (sorted or unsorted) take up a lot more space, but the online things occupy your brain too.</p>

<p>What are you doing for discardia?  We've been emptying kitchen cupboards of unused pans - one piece that's on its way out is a broiling pan (Not Much Use In A Vegetarian Household).</p>

<p>3:15.  Lawn extension and city street right-of-way.</p>

<p>The owner of every parcel of land is responsible for grading, planting, mowing and raking the extension or city street right-of-way so that it is covered with turf grass with an average height not in excess of 12 inches or other ground cover vegetation with an average height not in excess of 36 inches above the adjacent road surface unless it presents a view hazard based on the criteria in the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 5th Edition (2005), or as subsequently amended. The city shall not be liable for damage to any vegetation planted, or to any property or fixtures placed, in or upon the lawn extension or the city right-of-way that results from work performed by the city in the lawn extension or right-of-way.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 43-04, § 17, 1-3-05; Ord. No. 19-05, § 4, 5-16-05)</p>

<p>A friend got a ticket for having an unmaintained extension, which she thinks is because her day lilies were too high (never mind that day lilies are a native plant and are beautiful this time of year).</p>

<p>More on day lilies from the <a href="http://www.daylilyclub.net/">Southern Michigan Daylily Society</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Some Daylilies are dormant with their foliage dying back completely,
others are evergreens, there is also a wide range in between referred
to as semi-evergreen.   They have tuberous, somewhat fleshy roots
and strap or grass-like leaves that arch gracefully making clumps
attractive even when not in bloom.</p>

<p>Clusters of blooms appear at the top of a mostly leafless stem, known <br />
as a scape, which grows above the foliage. Sometimes there is <br />
branching on the scape allowing for multiple blooms each day. The <br />
Daylily bloom itself is only open for one day hence the name <br />
Hemerocallis, “beautiful for a day”.<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-19-the-notebooks-o/">The notebooks of Cosma Shalizi</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Since 1994, Cosma Shalizi has been keeping track of what he is reading and what he is interested in in his <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/">notebooks</a> online.</p>

<pre>
Burned all my notebooks 
What good are notebooks 
If they won't help me survive?
</pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/faq.html#colophon">colophon</a> is worth quoting in full, though you'll need to go to the original to get all of the hyperlinks.</p>

<p><blockquote>
These notebooks began in September 1994 as a set of key-words for Usenet filtering; I don&rsquo;t remember why I started to elaborate them, but I did, and put them online on 3 October 1994. They quickly became a single huge useless file, which a few people, moved by boredom, misplaced pity or Teutonic thoroughness, were kind enough to read. At their urging, on 13 March 1995 I split it into many more or less conveniently sized files, one per subject, ordered by date. (Those still dated 1994 haven&rsquo;t been significantly changed since before then, or if they have, I&rsquo;ve been too lazy to update their date.) That was the last change in format until March 2004, when I moved them into Blosxom, so they could have an RSS feed and a basic search facility (since I&rsquo;m clearly never going to get around to creating, much less maintaining, a genuine index).</p>

<p>The notebooks have been written in Emacs on, successively, 1992-vintage NeXT workstations, a succession of Sun workstations, a second-hand Powerbook Duo named sloth, a much-missed Powerbook G4 named gluttony and, currently, a new Powerbook named wrath. (Note to hardware manufacturers: those could be the names of your products instead, if you give them to me!) Each notebook is a simple HTML file. (The ones containing mathematical symbols are produced using HTMX.) For the first ten years, that was it. Since I started using Blosxom, it's dynamically generated the displayed pages, so that the pages you read are filtered, prettified versions of the ones I write. Index pages are statically generated (using cron every half hour), so they get served faster, and some fiddling with Apache's URL re-writing engine keeps you from seeing the seams. The complete installation uses the following Blosxom plugins: entries_template, file, find, flavourdir, foreshortened, interpolate_conditional, meta, metadate, SmartyPants, storytitle.

      <p>A place to collect fruit crop damage reports for 2008.  Today is the 53rd Annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association, will be June 18, at 2 p.m. at the Amway Grand Hotel, in Grand Rapids; when those reports come in for real I'll post them.</p>

Poor Weather Has Cut Size of Most U.S. Fruit Crops</p>

<p>June 19, 2008 - By Dick Lehnert <br />
Managing Editor</p>

<p>Crummy spring weather coast to coast has reduced the production for most fruit crops. The word “record” was used only once – for blueberries – during the 53rd annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate. </p>

<p>The Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association and attended by more than 150 people from across North America, was held June 18 in Grand Rapids, Mich. </p>

<p>Many of the presenters adjusted their PowerPoint presentations as they were making them, reflecting continuing poor weather. New York has hit by a hail storm of “epic proportions” on June 16, and the June drop, delayed and prolonged by cool weather that slowed crop development, was still taking apples and peaches from trees across the northern states. <br />

<p><blockquote>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just completely trashed,&rdquo; Williams said of the small tract of cherry trees along Bright Road south of Maple City. &ldquo;You can see how it took the leaves down and everything &hellip; it stripped (the cherries) right off the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hail that pelted Williams' fruit trees marked the latest episode in a series of nature-related setbacks blamed for damaging the region's cherry crop. This year's harvest is shaping up as the worst since the nearly cherry-less summer of 2002, experts said.<br />

<p><blockquote>
Orchards were damaged last week when temperatures dropped as low as the mid-20s, but farms in the northern half of the county – above the 45th Parallel – weren’t hit quite so hard, said Nikki Rothwell, director of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Resource Station.</p>

<p>“I think there is significant damage out there. We can’t put a number on it but we’ve got poor pollination on top of a freeze event,” she said.</p>

<p>Apples were hit hardest by early morning cold May 28, followed by sweet cherries and then tarts and other crops growing in moderate to poor sites, or in a valley or pocket more susceptible to cold weather, she said.<br />

      <p>via <a href="http://ubois.com">archivist Jeff Ubois</a>, this account of using needle sorting cards for human intelligence gathering:</p>

<blockquote>
Alfred De Grazia, with Floyd Hunter and Paul Deutschmann, wrote a training manual in 1954 for the State Dept., "DISCOVERING NATIONAL ELITES   A Manual of Methods for Discovering the Leadership of a Society and Its Vulnerabilities to Propaganda" that includes an approach to social network analysis for "propaganda-target analysis" based on punch cards. It's now been declassified:

</ul>

<p>The rest of De Grazia's site is out there (though one might have said the same thing in 1954 if presented with a scheme for punch card analysis of social networks.)<br />

<p>If you look closely at this personnel record, it's eerily reminscent of the data structure of a LinkedIn record.  Note that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/18/digitalmedia.mediabusiness2">LinkedIn just sold off a 5% slice for $53 million</a>, giving them a nominal valuation of $1 billion; with 23 million membership records, that's about $40 per punchcard.</p>

<p>Kevin Kelly (re)discovered these cards recently and has a nice set with photos in his piece <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/one_dead_media.php">One Dead Media</a>, noticing that nothing of this description was anything he could find anywhere:</p>

<blockquote>
But prescient as it was, and as cool as these cards were, I searched the Net today for any sign of InDecks and was surprised to find no sellers on eBay, no fan sites, no collector sites, no historical web pages, and no evidence that anyone is still using them.  They are gone. Blasted out by the first computers. Bruce Sterling lists them in his Dead Media file, a catalog of defunct media devices and platforms.  They seem to be verifiably extinct.

<p>Believing that nothing really goes extinct, I challenge you to reinvent these in some useful, usable way.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The great pop vs. soda controversy is a project that Alan McConchie did to survey regional use of generic names for soft drinks.  You'll see here clearly that Michigan is a "pop" state; the sharp Wisconsin vs. Upper Peninsula divide of soda vs. pop is notable.  You have to do pretty far south into Indiana to see "coke" as the generic.</p>

<p>Matthew Campbell from East Central University (Oklahoma) took this data set and organized it on county boundaries.  Again Wisconsin vs. UP is clear on the soda/pop scale.  I'll attribute that to a difference in state law: it's "pop" if you have to pay a 10 cent deposit on the can, and "soda" if you don't.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year around this time (June 17) the juneberry trees in the streets of Ann Arbor are ripe. </p>

<p>Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you're from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy.  They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you're walking down the street.   If you have lots and lots of these berries (also called saskatoons), you can make a pie out of them - make a two crust pie, with a filling of 3.5 cups juneberries to 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 Tbs of flour.    Here's a video from <a href="http://wildfoodplants.com/article/113/aunt-marilyns-juneberry-pie">Wild Food Plants</a> about Aunt Marilyn's Juneberry Pie.  You can also dry them and use them like dried blueberries - if you get any of them home, or you can pound them with buffalo meat (from your favorite local supplier of buffalo meat) and make pemmican.  </p>

<p>In addition, if you have surplus juneberries *and* surplus grasshoppers, and a taste for them both, there's a traditional Utah Indian recipe for "grasshopper fruitcake":</p>

<blockquote>
Edwin Bryant15 (circa 1848) provided one of the few assessments of grasshopper palatability by a white. following an encounter with Utah Indians, an occasion when three women appeared, "bringing baskets containing a substance, which, upon examination, we ascertained to be service-berries, crushed to a jam and mixed with pulverized grasshoppers. This composition being dried in the sun until it becomes hard, is what may be called the 'fruitcake' of these poor children of the desert. No doubt these women regarded it as one of the most acceptable offerings they could make to us. We purchased all they brought with them, paying them in darning needles and other small articles, with which they were much pleased. The prejudice against the grasshopper 'fruitcake' was strong at first, but it soon wore off, and none of the delicacy was thrown away or lost .... After being killed, they [the grasshoppers] are baked before the fire or dried in the sun, and then pulverized between smooth stones. Prejudice aside, I have tasted what are called delicacies, less agree able to the palate." 
</blockquote>

<p>The secret to juneberry picking in Ann Arbor is to know that you can have a big pile of delicious berries simply by walking across town in such a way that you hit a series of trees in order, no need to backtrack.  Here's the juneberry tour:</p>

<p>Start at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Zingerman's">Zingerman's Deli</a> on Detroit St.  If you can't find it, ask a native, they'll be glad to direct you there, they're used to it.  The juneberry trees are around the side on Kingsley St.  Stop inside, ask if they have any <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/Search.aspx?kw=juneberry">juneberry jam</a> for sale, furrow your brow disappointedly if they don't, taste something else thoughfully, then head out the front and pick more from a tree on Detroit St.</p>

<p>Keep heading up Detroit St and cross over to <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Farmers_Market">Farmer's Market</a>, open Weds. and Sat.  Look around the stalls, ask the farmers nicely if their juneberry crop is good this year, furrow your brow when they say they won't have any at market, admire the solar panels, pick up from spinach from Shannon, and then walk towards the Ann Arbor Observer on Catherine St.  You'll find more berries on the side of that building, they are a bit shaded so they ripen later.  Pick a small box full, head back to market, put a price tag on it, sell it - PROFIT!</p>

<p>Cross back toward Fifth Avenue, head over Huron St and towards the Bank of Ann Arbor.  With your newfound gains make a deposit, but only after you do your harvest from the trees in front of the bank.</p>

<p>Keep heading south on Fifth heading towards the <a href="http://www.aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a>, but stop before you get there at the Library Lot parking lot and admire the prolific trees there.  Consider whether the <A href="http://arborupdate.com/article/1660/downtown-library-project-discussion">downtown library project</a> plans for that surface lot which call for a structure to be built on that lot preserve the fruiting trees which are so characteristic of historical Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>Head into the library, and start figuring out how you are going to preserve those berries for the winter.  Check the <a href="http://www.aadl.org/sopac/tag/juneberry">juneberry</a> tag in the catalog; if you don't find anything, go to the MEL inter-library loan, <a href="http://elibrary.mel.org/search/X?%28juneberry%29&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&backlink=http://www.aadl.org/cat/seek/search/X?(juneberry)&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&topformsub=1">search for Juneberry</a>, and end up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Juneberry-tree-French-writers-Canada/dp/0887721583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213754418&sr=8-1">Jacque Ferron's</a> "The Juneberry Tree".  Sit and eat your berries until it arrives.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Theories of networked individualism and forms of urban alienation challenge the continued purpose and relevance of conventional community tools in urban neighbourhood. However, the majority of urban residents surveyed in this research still believe that there are people living in their immediate neighbourhood who may share their interests or who are at least personally compatible, but they do not know them. Web-based community networking systems have the potential to facilitate intra-neighbourhood interaction and support community building efforts. Community networking studies have shown that technical connectivity alone does not ensure community, and that new and weak communities do not benefit from community networking systems as much as existing and strong communities do. This paper builds on these findings to present a methodology combining principles of Participation, Animation and Design (PAD). It is currently being employed and tested in a master-planned inner-city residential development. PAD builds on intrinsic motivation in residents to find out about and meet one another in a private and inobtrusive way. It encourages residents to take social ownership of the community building process and the community network. PAD recognises the network qualities in the communicative ecology of urban residents and supplements collective approaches towards community building with personalised networking strategies.<br />

      <p>I went strawberry picking with the boys on Father's Day at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rowes">Rowe's Produce Farm</a> in <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rawsonville">Rawsonville</a>, about a mile s. of the Rawsonville Road exit between <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ypsilanti">Ypsilanti</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Belleville</a>Belleville</a>.  It was a hot day with a bright sun, the berries were ripe but not overripe, and we picked an 8 qt tray in no time at all.</p>

<p>Afterwards I washed and picked over the berries (a 3 y/o, no matter how enthusiastic, is not a perfect judge of ripeness or berry quality).  We froze 3 qts whole on a cookie sheet, and the rest were used for strawberry shortcake w/fresh whipping cream delivered from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Calder_Dairy">Calder Dairy</a>.  Mmmm.</p>

<p>Some notes to self for next year:</p>

<p>Bring more water!  Picking in the hot sun is hot, and you get dried out fast.  I should have had a gallon with me.</p>

<p>Make sure you have sunglasses and a good hat!  I felt pretty sun-bleached afterwards.</p>

<p>Go out as early as you can, so it's not so hot and the sun is not so bright.</p>

<p>We made a field trip to the <A href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/otisvillecem.html">Otisville Cemetery</a> south of Belleville, where I have some ancestors buried - there's a story to that settlement that I haven't figured out yet, it's a pleasant but nondescript spot in a rural area with graves from the 1840s-1900s.  Some bits of family history are in the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/belleville.html">Carpenter-Hope</a> section of a Belleville city history.<br />
<blockquote><br />
CARPENTER-HOPE <br />
<b>John and Lucy Carpenter</b>, one of Van Buren's pioneering family raised a family of four girls one their farm land on Martinsville Road. Their daughter, Angeline M. married to Richard Hope and moved into a home located at 187 Main Street in Belleville. Daughter, Matilda, married Jenx Pullen and moved into a home located on Martinsville Road. <b>Mary Jane</b> married <b>Woodbury Clark</b>, and lived in one of the Clark residences. Lucy married George Quirk. A descendant of the Hope family , named Margaret later wrote that the property located at 187 Main Street, was the site of the 1886 Soldiers and Sailors Encampment. <br />
Margaret Hope was born April 9, 1876, the daughter of Richard and Angeline (Carpenter) Hope. Her father, Richard was born in Detroit in 1844 and came to Belleville with his parents, John and Joanne (Winkleman) Hope, sometime in the 1850's. John Hope served as Treasurer in 1859 and Justice of the Peace in 1868. By 1875 he had changed his occupation from blacksmith to cobbling boots and shoes. <br />
Richard Hope built his home at 187 Main Street about 1880. He and his wife, Angeline had previously resided in a backhouse behind the home of William Warren. Richard worked as a drover, a livestock buyer, and was the proprietor of a meat market. He later owned a second farm on Sumpter Road and served as Belleville's Drain Commissioner in 1894/95. <br />
Richard Hope died on November 19, 1901 at that age of 57, killed at the Wabash RailRoad crossing on Sumpter Road, as he traveled to his farm. He and his wife had, had 2 children, Louis, who later moved to Texas and married, where he had a son named, Stewart. When Louis passed away, his son, Stewart came back to Belleville and was raised by Margaret Hope. <br />
Margaret, moved with her parents to their home at 374 Main Street when she was 4 years old. She worked in many local community occupations such as teacher and secretary for Henry Van Schoick Harness, Carriage, and Hardware business. She also worked at the Peoples Bank of Belleville. She also had a lifelong committment to the Belleville Grange, a local farmers group, where she worked as its secretary from 1906 to 1955. Margaret passed away in September of 1955.<br />

At a previous employer's previous location, my office was on a street (Depot St) regularly used to speed through town.

A similar set of data (not precisely the same, but overlapping) is kept by the National Weather Service, as part of their <a href="http://www.weather.gov/ahps">Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service</a>.  This has a whole set of comprehensive rainfall measures, which are as useful in drought condition monitoring as they are in flood monitoring.<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-dte-energy-the/">DTE power outage mobile phone reporting interface</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:DTE">DTE Energy</a>, the power provider for SE Michigan, now has a mobile web based trouble reporting interface:</p>

<p><blockquote>Now you can report power outages on line using a mobile device.</p>

<p>Just go to <a href="http://mobile.dteenergy.com">mobile.dteenergy.com</a> with your web-based cell phone or PDA. In moments you can report an outage or get a repair estimate on a previously reported outage.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>This is reporting only, not mapping, and the mobile interface has the most pessimistic assumptions about mobile phone capacity.  If you have a cell phone capable of displaying a PDF file, you can get the <a href="http://my.dteenergy.com/map/zipCodeOutageMap.pdf">DTE power outage map</a> directly.  Oddly, the mobile phone interface does not include a regular phone number (1-800-477-4747) on it if you happen to have a problem with the web site.</p>

<p>There were quite a few problems with incoming phone calls to that phone number in the past few days; they were attributed to problems they were working on with the help of Verizon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/BLOG01/80612021/1007/NEWS">Mike Wendland from the Free Press</a> has been without power for a week, and relates this trouble report:<br />
<blockquote><br />
In my area of Oakland Township, said James, there were still six downed wires that needed to be fixed, a blown transformer, problems with an underground connection and still unknown issues at a nearby substation. He said crews were working 24 hours a day but there was still much to be done.<br />
</blockquote><br />
There are plenty of comments on his post regarding the untrustworthiness of DTE estimated time to repair numbers that are being given out, and unwillingness to believe the counts of houses without power:<br />
<blockquote><br />
We've been in a hotel for 3 nights, but...late yesterday, I got my hopes up. Our status was 'power restored'!!! My husband went to the house today at noon, and no...no power, and it hadn't been on in the neighborhood at all. I have to believe they're just closing some work tickets to make things look better, then reopening them when the get the 2nd, or 3rd or 4th call. This has happened to several people I work with as well. One got through to a warm body at DTE and they said "You don't have power? We show you do!!!" That whole neighborhood was and is "down". <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>More bad weather expected Friday, of course it's too soon to know if this will trigger more outages.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Continuing the summer power grid watch theme - lots of Oakland County, MI still is waiting for restoration of service - let's look at the real time map for watching the greater power grid.</p>

<p>In the Midwest, power coordination between utilities is done through the <a href="http://www.midwestiso.org">Midwest ISO</a>, an organization that is responsible for orderly transfer of capacity between generators and transmission lines and for helping plan and predict seasonal and outage-related load changes that require competitors to work together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.midwestiso.org/page/LMP+Contour+Map+%26+Data"><img class="image-full" alt="Midwest ISO Power Grid Map for June 12 2008" title="Picture_12" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/12/picture_12.png" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>The screen snap below shows the current state of the grid, with a link from that page to the <a href="http://www.midwestiso.org/page/LMP+Contour+Map+%26+Data">LMP Contour Map live map and underlying dataset.</a>  In short, when the color of this map is cool blues and greens, the spot market for power is cheap and there's plenty to go around; when it starts to heat up orange and red, utilities pay more for that added watt and look for ways to ensure enough supply and shed load.</p>

<p>You'll notice if you watch this enough times that you get periodic regional fluctuations in power pricing, either reflecting plants that are temporarily offline or temperature differences or other regional changes.  It's not free to move power from place to place, and so even if it's cheap in western New York State it might not be possible to get those megawatts to Minnesota without unacceptable losses underway.</p>

<p>This is the sort of page I'd love to see as a daily animated map, just like the weather maps, and as the very simple in-home user signal that says "grid power condition orange, wait until later to run the dishwasher".</p>

</a><br />
Last year there was a fire near Sleeper Lake in Newberry, MI in the UP; when I wrote about it, I collected <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/08/fire-maps-for-t.html">fire maps of the Sleeper Lake area</a> showing where the fire lines were.  That fire is out now, but that page where I had those maps is still getting a steady stream of page views.  So, I have to ask, why?</p>

<p>The other popular seasonal page is my annual <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/04/michigan-morel.html">Michigan morel map</a>, which I pull an excerpt from the <a href="http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morel_progression_sightings_map.htm">morel progression sightings map</a> and highlight the appearance of these tasty mushrooms in the Michigan woods.</p>

<p>We know from previous years and previous burns that <a href="http://www.fungaljungal.org/morels/mofire.htm">morels love to grow where it has recently burned</a>.  US Forest Service research credited to David Pilz (!) on <a href="http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/7345">Productivity and diversity of morel mushrooms in healthy, burned, and insect damaged forests of northeastern Oregon</a> speaks to forest manager use of fire to promote mushroom growth.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's morel season near Newberry now, and of course no one will tell you exactly where to pick.  I would, however, take a look at that fire map before I went out.</p>

<p>Newberry is hosting a <a href="http://www.newberrytourism.com/">THE FIRE IS GONE AND THE SPIRIT LIVES ON’ 4TH OF JULY PARADE</a> this year - contact Mary Archambeau at 906-293-3729 with any questions.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Confirmation!  No exact details of course, but here from <a href="http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morelfinds.html">the Morel Finds page on morelmushroomhunting.com</a></p>

June 6th, 2008: Brian Grant  burnsite morel - general location = Newberry Michigan Growing Conditions = Hi Chris We had 20,000 acres burn here around Sleeper Lake in the UP last August and fire burn morels have showed up here since last weekend. I've never seen them in Michigan before except in pictures.I have picked around 80 pounds since Saturday. The burned pine areas are producing the best. Unbelievable!  Should be good pickin through the weekend with these cooler temps and more rain now. This is a once in a lifetime for me, I'm sure.  Additional Comments = Chris...Will a burn area such as this, produce any next year? Very little the second year. - Chris M

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-ann-arbor-start/">Ann Arbor Startup Weekend, June 20-22 2008</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Laura Fisher (and a cast of thousands) is organizing <a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com">Ann Arbor Startup Weekend</a>, June 20-22 2008 in downtown Ann Arbor.<br/></p>

<p><a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com"><br />
<img alt="Laura Fisher photo for Ann Arbor Startup Weekend" title="Large_startup_061208" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/12/large_startup_061208.jpg" border="0"  /><br/></p>

<p>There's a nice <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/06/startup_weekend_to_bring_entre.html">story in the Ann Arbor News</a> about the event; I'll excerpt:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The intent of the event, which has been held in several cities throughout the country, is to start the weekend with no formal business plans and emerge a few days later with a couple of real companies.</p>

<p>Fisher's job is to collect as many business-minded people as possible to bring their ideas and expertise. When the weekend rolls around Friday, June 20, the group will break into teams, choose some of the best ideas and get to work.</p>

<p>"I call it guerilla economic development," she said.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>It can be challenging for traditional economic development practitioners to wrap their heads around support for entrepreneurship.  I dug this up from the Kellogg-funded <a href="http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/chapter2.php">RUPRI Center for Rural Entrepreneurship</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Economic development practitioners are reluctant to abandon the traditional tools of their trade: development of natural resources, industrial attraction and small business retention and expansion. These tools worked in the past and, absent a new toolkit, we tend to continue with the same, familiar strategies.</p>

<p>The outcomes of investing in entrepreneurship occur over the long-term, and individual successes often don’t lend themselves to public ribbon cuttings. Helping an artisan tap new regional markets via the Internet may increase sales and establish a successful business, but it can’t compete with the headlines resulting from a branch plant opening.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>This can explain some of the strained relationships that sometimes happen between entrepreneurs and economic development groups - the measures of success don't happen on the same time or size scales between the two groups.  This doesn't mean that people will be hostile to each other, or that they won't appreciate each others commitments to the process - just that the traditional economic development organization has funding and accountability which simply doesn't let it be a "guerrilla" agency.</p>

The map above is not quite enough to decide where to stop, except to note that if you happen to be heading south you should probably fill up in Ohio, not Michigan (tax differences account for the price difference).  To do the real time decision support to save you a dollar or two on your next tank, use <a href="http://www.gasbuddytogo.com">Gas Buddy To Go</a> on your mobile phone and plug in the city or zip code you're in to get the lowest prices in that area.  <br />

Google's Street View has come to Ann Arbor.  From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon.  The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi's toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.  With the exception of a short foray through the private drive in Barton Hills, nothing outside the freeway limits was explored.  No Ypsi, no Chelsea, not even the bits of Ann Arbor on the wrong side of the concrete walls.<br />
