            <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the delicious tag polenta, from the blog Hungry Cravings - the so called Cheater Method Polenta.
The critics were skeptical:
Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck!
but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-01-baked-polenta-no-stir-polenta-sounds-like-no-water-soup---possible-but-unlikely/">&raquo;</a></p>

Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.

This recipe comes close to what you&#39;ll find as the soup in any of the middle eastern restaurants around town - easy to make (10 minutes chopping at the beginning), forgiving, easy to make in quantity, and sustaining on days when you get the first snow of the season.
You&#39;ll want to keep red lentils in stock in your pantry so that you can always make this soup in a pinch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-27-middle-eastern-lentil-soup/">&raquo;</a></p>

That said, I&#39;m taking some notes to share.
Hand Food and Mouth Disease, from the Center for Disease Control
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not related—they are caused by different viruses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-27-hand-foot-mouth-disease-hfmd---some-facts/">&raquo;</a></p>

Wash and trim the green beans, chop the tomatoes, smash the garlic.
Heat the oil in a big pan, saute the garlic, add the green beans, add the tomatoes.&#0160; Sprinkle on dried basil.
