<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>A place to collect fruit crop damage reports for 2008.  Today is the 53rd Annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association, will be June 18, at 2 p.m. at the Amway Grand Hotel, in Grand Rapids; when those reports come in for real I'll post them.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Guesstimate results are in - details here, too long to post, at <a href="http://fruitgrowersnews.com/pages/news.php?ns=1614">Fruit Growers News</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Poor Weather Has Cut Size of Most U.S. Fruit Crops</p>

<p>June 19, 2008 - By Dick Lehnert <br />
Managing Editor</p>

<p>Crummy spring weather coast to coast has reduced the production for most fruit crops. The word “record” was used only once – for blueberries – during the 53rd annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate. </p>

<p>The Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association and attended by more than 150 people from across North America, was held June 18 in Grand Rapids, Mich. </p>

<p>Many of the presenters adjusted their PowerPoint presentations as they were making them, reflecting continuing poor weather. New York has hit by a hail storm of “epic proportions” on June 16, and the June drop, delayed and prolonged by cool weather that slowed crop development, was still taking apples and peaches from trees across the northern states. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>June 18: <a href="http://www.record-eagle.com/local/local_story_170094110.html">Traverse City cherry crop damage</a></p>

<p><blockquote>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just completely trashed,&rdquo; Williams said of the small tract of cherry trees along Bright Road south of Maple City. &ldquo;You can see how it took the leaves down and everything &hellip; it stripped (the cherries) right off the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hail that pelted Williams' fruit trees marked the latest episode in a series of nature-related setbacks blamed for damaging the region's cherry crop. This year's harvest is shaping up as the worst since the nearly cherry-less summer of 2002, experts said.<br />

<p><blockquote>
Orchards were damaged last week when temperatures dropped as low as the mid-20s, but farms in the northern half of the county – above the 45th Parallel – weren’t hit quite so hard, said Nikki Rothwell, director of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Resource Station.</p>

<p>“I think there is significant damage out there. We can’t put a number on it but we’ve got poor pollination on top of a freeze event,” she said.</p>

<p>Apples were hit hardest by early morning cold May 28, followed by sweet cherries and then tarts and other crops growing in moderate to poor sites, or in a valley or pocket more susceptible to cold weather, she said.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>via <a href="http://ubois.com">archivist Jeff Ubois</a>, this account of using needle sorting cards for human intelligence gathering:</p>

<blockquote>
Alfred De Grazia, with Floyd Hunter and Paul Deutschmann, wrote a training manual in 1954 for the State Dept., "DISCOVERING NATIONAL ELITES   A Manual of Methods for Discovering the Leadership of a Society and Its Vulnerabilities to Propaganda" that includes an approach to social network analysis for "propaganda-target analysis" based on punch cards. It's now been declassified:

</ul>

<p>The rest of De Grazia's site is out there (though one might have said the same thing in 1954 if presented with a scheme for punch card analysis of social networks.)<br />

<p>If you look closely at this personnel record, it's eerily reminscent of the data structure of a LinkedIn record.  Note that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/18/digitalmedia.mediabusiness2">LinkedIn just sold off a 5% slice for $53 million</a>, giving them a nominal valuation of $1 billion; with 23 million membership records, that's about $40 per punchcard.</p>

<p>Kevin Kelly (re)discovered these cards recently and has a nice set with photos in his piece <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/one_dead_media.php">One Dead Media</a>, noticing that nothing of this description was anything he could find anywhere:</p>

<blockquote>
But prescient as it was, and as cool as these cards were, I searched the Net today for any sign of InDecks and was surprised to find no sellers on eBay, no fan sites, no collector sites, no historical web pages, and no evidence that anyone is still using them.  They are gone. Blasted out by the first computers. Bruce Sterling lists them in his Dead Media file, a catalog of defunct media devices and platforms.  They seem to be verifiably extinct.
</blockquote>

<p>Believing that nothing really goes extinct, I challenge you to reinvent these in some useful, usable way.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The great pop vs. soda controversy is a project that Alan McConchie did to survey regional use of generic names for soft drinks.  You'll see here clearly that Michigan is a "pop" state; the sharp Wisconsin vs. Upper Peninsula divide of soda vs. pop is notable.  You have to do pretty far south into Indiana to see "coke" as the generic.</p>

<p>Matthew Campbell from East Central University (Oklahoma) took this data set and organized it on county boundaries.  Again Wisconsin vs. UP is clear on the soda/pop scale.  I'll attribute that to a difference in state law: it's "pop" if you have to pay a 10 cent deposit on the can, and "soda" if you don't.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-17-2008-urban-berr/">2008 urban berry foraging report part 1: Juneberries in Ann Arbor</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every year around this time (June 17) the juneberry trees in the streets of Ann Arbor are ripe. </p>

<p>Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you're from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy.  They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you're walking down the street.   If you have lots and lots of these berries (also called saskatoons), you can make a pie out of them - make a two crust pie, with a filling of 3.5 cups juneberries to 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 Tbs of flour.    Here's a video from <a href="http://wildfoodplants.com/article/113/aunt-marilyns-juneberry-pie">Wild Food Plants</a> about Aunt Marilyn's Juneberry Pie.  You can also dry them and use them like dried blueberries - if you get any of them home, or you can pound them with buffalo meat (from your favorite local supplier of buffalo meat) and make pemmican.  </p>

<p>In addition, if you have surplus juneberries *and* surplus grasshoppers, and a taste for them both, there's a traditional Utah Indian recipe for "grasshopper fruitcake":</p>

<blockquote>
Edwin Bryant15 (circa 1848) provided one of the few assessments of grasshopper palatability by a white. following an encounter with Utah Indians, an occasion when three women appeared, "bringing baskets containing a substance, which, upon examination, we ascertained to be service-berries, crushed to a jam and mixed with pulverized grasshoppers. This composition being dried in the sun until it becomes hard, is what may be called the 'fruitcake' of these poor children of the desert. No doubt these women regarded it as one of the most acceptable offerings they could make to us. We purchased all they brought with them, paying them in darning needles and other small articles, with which they were much pleased. The prejudice against the grasshopper 'fruitcake' was strong at first, but it soon wore off, and none of the delicacy was thrown away or lost .... After being killed, they [the grasshoppers] are baked before the fire or dried in the sun, and then pulverized between smooth stones. Prejudice aside, I have tasted what are called delicacies, less agree able to the palate." 
</blockquote>

<p>The secret to juneberry picking in Ann Arbor is to know that you can have a big pile of delicious berries simply by walking across town in such a way that you hit a series of trees in order, no need to backtrack.  Here's the juneberry tour:</p>

<p>Start at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Zingerman's">Zingerman's Deli</a> on Detroit St.  If you can't find it, ask a native, they'll be glad to direct you there, they're used to it.  The juneberry trees are around the side on Kingsley St.  Stop inside, ask if they have any <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/Search.aspx?kw=juneberry">juneberry jam</a> for sale, furrow your brow disappointedly if they don't, taste something else thoughfully, then head out the front and pick more from a tree on Detroit St.</p>

<p>Keep heading up Detroit St and cross over to <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Farmers_Market">Farmer's Market</a>, open Weds. and Sat.  Look around the stalls, ask the farmers nicely if their juneberry crop is good this year, furrow your brow when they say they won't have any at market, admire the solar panels, pick up from spinach from Shannon, and then walk towards the Ann Arbor Observer on Catherine St.  You'll find more berries on the side of that building, they are a bit shaded so they ripen later.  Pick a small box full, head back to market, put a price tag on it, sell it - PROFIT!</p>

<p>Cross back toward Fifth Avenue, head over Huron St and towards the Bank of Ann Arbor.  With your newfound gains make a deposit, but only after you do your harvest from the trees in front of the bank.</p>

<p>Keep heading south on Fifth heading towards the <a href="http://www.aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a>, but stop before you get there at the Library Lot parking lot and admire the prolific trees there.  Consider whether the <A href="http://arborupdate.com/article/1660/downtown-library-project-discussion">downtown library project</a> plans for that surface lot which call for a structure to be built on that lot preserve the fruiting trees which are so characteristic of historical Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>Head into the library, and start figuring out how you are going to preserve those berries for the winter.  Check the <a href="http://www.aadl.org/sopac/tag/juneberry">juneberry</a> tag in the catalog; if you don't find anything, go to the MEL inter-library loan, <a href="http://elibrary.mel.org/search/X?%28juneberry%29&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&backlink=http://www.aadl.org/cat/seek/search/X?(juneberry)&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&topformsub=1">search for Juneberry</a>, and end up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Juneberry-tree-French-writers-Canada/dp/0887721583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213754418&sr=8-1">Jacque Ferron's</a> "The Juneberry Tree".  Sit and eat your berries until it arrives.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Theories of networked individualism and forms of urban alienation challenge the continued purpose and relevance of conventional community tools in urban neighbourhood. However, the majority of urban residents surveyed in this research still believe that there are people living in their immediate neighbourhood who may share their interests or who are at least personally compatible, but they do not know them. Web-based community networking systems have the potential to facilitate intra-neighbourhood interaction and support community building efforts. Community networking studies have shown that technical connectivity alone does not ensure community, and that new and weak communities do not benefit from community networking systems as much as existing and strong communities do. This paper builds on these findings to present a methodology combining principles of Participation, Animation and Design (PAD). It is currently being employed and tested in a master-planned inner-city residential development. PAD builds on intrinsic motivation in residents to find out about and meet one another in a private and inobtrusive way. It encourages residents to take social ownership of the community building process and the community network. PAD recognises the network qualities in the communicative ecology of urban residents and supplements collective approaches towards community building with personalised networking strategies.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>I went strawberry picking with the boys on Father's Day at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rowes">Rowe's Produce Farm</a> in <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rawsonville">Rawsonville</a>, about a mile s. of the Rawsonville Road exit between <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ypsilanti">Ypsilanti</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Belleville</a>Belleville</a>.  It was a hot day with a bright sun, the berries were ripe but not overripe, and we picked an 8 qt tray in no time at all.</p>

<p>Afterwards I washed and picked over the berries (a 3 y/o, no matter how enthusiastic, is not a perfect judge of ripeness or berry quality).  We froze 3 qts whole on a cookie sheet, and the rest were used for strawberry shortcake w/fresh whipping cream delivered from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Calder_Dairy">Calder Dairy</a>.  Mmmm.</p>

<p>Some notes to self for next year:</p>

<p>Bring more water!  Picking in the hot sun is hot, and you get dried out fast.  I should have had a gallon with me.</p>

<p>Make sure you have sunglasses and a good hat!  I felt pretty sun-bleached afterwards.</p>

<p>Go out as early as you can, so it's not so hot and the sun is not so bright.</p>

<p>We made a field trip to the <A href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/otisvillecem.html">Otisville Cemetery</a> south of Belleville, where I have some ancestors buried - there's a story to that settlement that I haven't figured out yet, it's a pleasant but nondescript spot in a rural area with graves from the 1840s-1900s.  Some bits of family history are in the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/belleville.html">Carpenter-Hope</a> section of a Belleville city history.<br />
<blockquote><br />
CARPENTER-HOPE <br />
<b>John and Lucy Carpenter</b>, one of Van Buren's pioneering family raised a family of four girls one their farm land on Martinsville Road. Their daughter, Angeline M. married to Richard Hope and moved into a home located at 187 Main Street in Belleville. Daughter, Matilda, married Jenx Pullen and moved into a home located on Martinsville Road. <b>Mary Jane</b> married <b>Woodbury Clark</b>, and lived in one of the Clark residences. Lucy married George Quirk. A descendant of the Hope family , named Margaret later wrote that the property located at 187 Main Street, was the site of the 1886 Soldiers and Sailors Encampment. <br />
Margaret Hope was born April 9, 1876, the daughter of Richard and Angeline (Carpenter) Hope. Her father, Richard was born in Detroit in 1844 and came to Belleville with his parents, John and Joanne (Winkleman) Hope, sometime in the 1850's. John Hope served as Treasurer in 1859 and Justice of the Peace in 1868. By 1875 he had changed his occupation from blacksmith to cobbling boots and shoes. <br />
Richard Hope built his home at 187 Main Street about 1880. He and his wife, Angeline had previously resided in a backhouse behind the home of William Warren. Richard worked as a drover, a livestock buyer, and was the proprietor of a meat market. He later owned a second farm on Sumpter Road and served as Belleville's Drain Commissioner in 1894/95. <br />
Richard Hope died on November 19, 1901 at that age of 57, killed at the Wabash RailRoad crossing on Sumpter Road, as he traveled to his farm. He and his wife had, had 2 children, Louis, who later moved to Texas and married, where he had a son named, Stewart. When Louis passed away, his son, Stewart came back to Belleville and was raised by Margaret Hope. <br />
Margaret, moved with her parents to their home at 374 Main Street when she was 4 years old. She worked in many local community occupations such as teacher and secretary for Henry Van Schoick Harness, Carriage, and Hardware business. She also worked at the Peoples Bank of Belleville. She also had a lifelong committment to the Belleville Grange, a local farmers group, where she worked as its secretary from 1906 to 1955. Margaret passed away in September of 1955.<br />

At a previous employer's previous location, my office was on a street (Depot St) regularly used to speed through town.  Every day people would zoom to and from the hospital, and every day the AAPD would stop some fraction of them to give them tickets.  I was glad for it too - to cross Depot when cars are barreling along at 45 in a 30 zone was not fun.  Slow down already.<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-dte-energy-the/">DTE power outage mobile phone reporting interface</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:DTE">DTE Energy</a>, the power provider for SE Michigan, now has a mobile web based trouble reporting interface:</p>

<p><blockquote>Now you can report power outages on line using a mobile device.</p>

<p>Just go to <a href="http://mobile.dteenergy.com">mobile.dteenergy.com</a> with your web-based cell phone or PDA. In moments you can report an outage or get a repair estimate on a previously reported outage.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>This is reporting only, not mapping, and the mobile interface has the most pessimistic assumptions about mobile phone capacity.  If you have a cell phone capable of displaying a PDF file, you can get the <a href="http://my.dteenergy.com/map/zipCodeOutageMap.pdf">DTE power outage map</a> directly.  Oddly, the mobile phone interface does not include a regular phone number (1-800-477-4747) on it if you happen to have a problem with the web site.</p>

<p>There were quite a few problems with incoming phone calls to that phone number in the past few days; they were attributed to problems they were working on with the help of Verizon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/BLOG01/80612021/1007/NEWS">Mike Wendland from the Free Press</a> has been without power for a week, and relates this trouble report:<br />
<blockquote><br />
In my area of Oakland Township, said James, there were still six downed wires that needed to be fixed, a blown transformer, problems with an underground connection and still unknown issues at a nearby substation. He said crews were working 24 hours a day but there was still much to be done.<br />
</blockquote><br />
There are plenty of comments on his post regarding the untrustworthiness of DTE estimated time to repair numbers that are being given out, and unwillingness to believe the counts of houses without power:<br />
<blockquote><br />
We've been in a hotel for 3 nights, but...late yesterday, I got my hopes up. Our status was 'power restored'!!! My husband went to the house today at noon, and no...no power, and it hadn't been on in the neighborhood at all. I have to believe they're just closing some work tickets to make things look better, then reopening them when the get the 2nd, or 3rd or 4th call. This has happened to several people I work with as well. One got through to a warm body at DTE and they said "You don't have power? We show you do!!!" That whole neighborhood was and is "down". <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>More bad weather expected Friday, of course it's too soon to know if this will trigger more outages.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Continuing the summer power grid watch theme - lots of Oakland County, MI still is waiting for restoration of service - let's look at the real time map for watching the greater power grid.</p>

<p>In the Midwest, power coordination between utilities is done through the <a href="http://www.midwestiso.org">Midwest ISO</a>, an organization that is responsible for orderly transfer of capacity between generators and transmission lines and for helping plan and predict seasonal and outage-related load changes that require competitors to work together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.midwestiso.org/page/LMP+Contour+Map+%26+Data"><img class="image-full" alt="Midwest ISO Power Grid Map for June 12 2008" title="Picture_12" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/12/picture_12.png" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>The screen snap below shows the current state of the grid, with a link from that page to the <a href="http://www.midwestiso.org/page/LMP+Contour+Map+%26+Data">LMP Contour Map live map and underlying dataset.</a>  In short, when the color of this map is cool blues and greens, the spot market for power is cheap and there's plenty to go around; when it starts to heat up orange and red, utilities pay more for that added watt and look for ways to ensure enough supply and shed load.</p>

<p>You'll notice if you watch this enough times that you get periodic regional fluctuations in power pricing, either reflecting plants that are temporarily offline or temperature differences or other regional changes.  It's not free to move power from place to place, and so even if it's cheap in western New York State it might not be possible to get those megawatts to Minnesota without unacceptable losses underway.</p>

<p>This is the sort of page I'd love to see as a daily animated map, just like the weather maps, and as the very simple in-home user signal that says "grid power condition orange, wait until later to run the dishwasher".</p>

</a><br />
Last year there was a fire near Sleeper Lake in Newberry, MI in the UP; when I wrote about it, I collected <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/08/fire-maps-for-t.html">fire maps of the Sleeper Lake area</a> showing where the fire lines were.  That fire is out now, but that page where I had those maps is still getting a steady stream of page views.  So, I have to ask, why?</p>

<p>The other popular seasonal page is my annual <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/04/michigan-morel.html">Michigan morel map</a>, which I pull an excerpt from the <a href="http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morel_progression_sightings_map.htm">morel progression sightings map</a> and highlight the appearance of these tasty mushrooms in the Michigan woods.</p>

<p>We know from previous years and previous burns that <a href="http://www.fungaljungal.org/morels/mofire.htm">morels love to grow where it has recently burned</a>.  US Forest Service research credited to David Pilz (!) on <a href="http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/7345">Productivity and diversity of morel mushrooms in healthy, burned, and insect damaged forests of northeastern Oregon</a> speaks to forest manager use of fire to promote mushroom growth.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's morel season near Newberry now, and of course no one will tell you exactly where to pick.  I would, however, take a look at that fire map before I went out.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Laura Fisher (and a cast of thousands) is organizing <a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com">Ann Arbor Startup Weekend</a>, June 20-22 2008 in downtown Ann Arbor.<br/></p>

<p><a href="http://www.annarbor.startupweekend.com"><br />
<img alt="Laura Fisher photo for Ann Arbor Startup Weekend" title="Large_startup_061208" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/12/large_startup_061208.jpg" border="0"  /><br/></p>

<p>There's a nice <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/06/startup_weekend_to_bring_entre.html">story in the Ann Arbor News</a> about the event; I'll excerpt:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The intent of the event, which has been held in several cities throughout the country, is to start the weekend with no formal business plans and emerge a few days later with a couple of real companies.</p>

<p>Fisher's job is to collect as many business-minded people as possible to bring their ideas and expertise. When the weekend rolls around Friday, June 20, the group will break into teams, choose some of the best ideas and get to work.</p>

<p>"I call it guerilla economic development," she said.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>It can be challenging for traditional economic development practitioners to wrap their heads around support for entrepreneurship.  I dug this up from the Kellogg-funded <a href="http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.org/content/chapter2.php">RUPRI Center for Rural Entrepreneurship</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Economic development practitioners are reluctant to abandon the traditional tools of their trade: development of natural resources, industrial attraction and small business retention and expansion. These tools worked in the past and, absent a new toolkit, we tend to continue with the same, familiar strategies.</p>

<p>The outcomes of investing in entrepreneurship occur over the long-term, and individual successes often don’t lend themselves to public ribbon cuttings. Helping an artisan tap new regional markets via the Internet may increase sales and establish a successful business, but it can’t compete with the headlines resulting from a branch plant opening.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>This can explain some of the strained relationships that sometimes happen between entrepreneurs and economic development groups - the measures of success don't happen on the same time or size scales between the two groups.  This doesn't mean that people will be hostile to each other, or that they won't appreciate each others commitments to the process - just that the traditional economic development organization has funding and accountability which simply doesn't let it be a "guerrilla" agency.</p>

Some highlights include <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=8_11">the opening of the Detroit Institute of Arts</a>, a 1922 <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=6A_22">parade of old cars</a>, and the <a href="http://www.lib.wayne.edu/resources/digital_library/det_news/video.php?vid=3R1_29">1925 Detroit News bread-baking contest</a>.<br />

<a href="http://gasbuddy.com">GasBuddy</a> has built a very nice infrastructure for tracking gas prices across the county.  If you sign up, you can update the site with current observations of pricing; if you don't sign up, you can still view individual and aggregated data.<br />

<p><br />
The map above is not quite enough to decide where to stop, except to note that if you happen to be heading south you should probably fill up in Ohio, not Michigan (tax differences account for the price difference).  To do the real time decision support to save you a dollar or two on your next tank, use <a href="http://www.gasbuddytogo.com">Gas Buddy To Go</a> on your mobile phone and plug in the city or zip code you're in to get the lowest prices in that area.  <br />

<p><br />
Google's Street View has come to Ann Arbor.  From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon.  The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi's toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.  With the exception of a short foray through the private drive in Barton Hills, nothing outside the freeway limits was explored.  No Ypsi, no Chelsea, not even the bits of Ann Arbor on the wrong side of the concrete walls.<br />

      <p>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form.  Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.</p>

<p>The single best blog on the topic is <a href="http://daveslandslideblog.blogspot.com/">Dave's Landslide Blog</a>, from Dave Petley, who is the Wilson Professor at Durham University, UK.  He's doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won't even try to be up to date with that.</p>

<p>As a previous example:</p>

<p>Lake Sarez in Tajikistan is the result of a 1911 earthquake, forming the 600 meter long Usoi landslide dam.  An <a href="http://eeg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/151">article in GeoScienceWorld by Schuster and Alford</a> discusses the risks of the dam failing.  A <a href="http://www.adrc.or.jp/countryreport/TJK/2003/page4.html">2003 risk mitigation project</a> installed remote warning sensors to alert villagers of risks detected.</p>

<p>Quake Lake in Montana formed after a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1959_08_18.php">1959 earthquake</a>; the <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/magazine/990815_mag01.html">Billings Gazette</a> captured memories of it in 1999.  The US Army Corps of Engineers was quickly put into service to build a spillway for the dam.</p>

<p>The price of the peas is the same as last season, $16.00 per bushel, $9.00 per half bushel, $5.00 per peck basket or if you just want a few they are $1.25 per pound.</p>

<p>Strawberries picking is fantastic now also so don't wait too long to get in on this years fun!</p>

      <h3>Grand Marais</h3>

<p>There is a limestone pier  <br />
That stretches into blue  <br />
Waves on Lake Superior <br />
   <br />
Where I cast a spoon into  <br />
Water glowing translucent green  <br />
Like sunlight through a leaf <br />
  <br />
And watch a lone fishing boat  <br />
Surrounded by circling gulls  <br />
That cry a plaintive call <br />
  <br />
Make its way from the blue waves  <br />
Toward the calm green water  <br />
Behind the seawall of the harbor  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>In the "try this next year" category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down.  Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there's frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don't have soil.</p>

<p>Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty.</p>

<p>There's apparently television advertising for these things (which tells you how much TV I watch) but these look pretty easy.</p>

<p>without further ado:</p>

<p>from <a href="http://greenthumbs.tribe.net/thread/5ea48cbb-5b2c-4320-8b70-e0e068cc58a9">greenthumbs.tribe.net :</a><br />
<blockquote><br />
My 83 year old dad told me he use to grow upside down tomatoes in an old tin, they would put a small hole in the end of the tin (I guess a paint tin? not sure what type tin they used) and plant the tomato plant upside down and at the top of the tin they would plant a pepper plant. He said they flourished! I have the upside down container that I am going to plant my tomatoes and herbs in this spring...I can't wait!<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>the <a href="http://www.michigan-sportsman.com/forum/showthread.php?p=2124372">Michigan Sportsman Forums</a> thread from Frantz:<br />
<blockquote><br />
I had great success with tomato plants, but peppers did poorly. I drilled a single hole and fed my seedlings up through the bottom. This year I am making the hole a little bigger and putting the plant through the inside of the bucket and using some landscape cloth to gold it all in. Last year the buckets with chives, parsley and basil growing on the top side did better. I think because it held the water in better for the tomato roots.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>the comments on a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/household/grow-your-tomatoes-upside-down-189767.php">Lifehacker</a> post:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Wow! If I knew there was a market for this, I would have had my grandmother patent it years ago. Since I was a little kid, she always grew her tomatoes upside-down -- by just using a simple plastic bucket & a few strategically placed holes.</p>

<p>And, as an added bonus? She planted azaleas on the top, so it not only looked pretty, but it would keep the bugs & other nasty critters from going after the tomato plant underneath.</p>

<p>We coulda been millionaires.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SXE553TFDO29BWZ/">Instructables</a> has pictures, planting in a coco fiber pot:<br />
<blockquote><br />
You will need the following materials:<br />
-hanging coco basket with a hole in the bottom of the frame<br />
-dirt (more on this later) I used peat moss, manure, and vermiculite<br />
-something to hang it from (I used a Shepard's hook)<br />
-and a tomato plant!!!!</p>

<p>The plant needs to be a baby plant, not one of those huge 1 gallon bucket plants.<br />

<p><a href="http://www.curbly.com/DIY-Maven/posts/1620-How-To-Make-An-Upside-Down-Tomato-Planter">Curbly has an illustrated How To Make An Upside Down Tomato Planter </a><br />
<blockquote><br />
Thank you for your DIY upside down tomato planter. It is the cheapest, most attractive one I've seen online. I planted two with Bush Celebrity Tomatoes and a third one (the one in the middle) planted with Jalapenos. I planted Thai Basil, Italian Parsley, Purple Sage, Sweet Woodruff, Italian Oregano, and Sweet Basil in the top of the planter. I realized that my pots are hanging a too low, so I have to shorten the cord, but I think they came out pretty good! Can't wait to see if my tomaotes and jalapenos will grow good upside down!<br />

<p>There's some art to the companion planting too.<br />
