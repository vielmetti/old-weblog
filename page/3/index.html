    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It seems that my pattern of going to public meetings includes writing FOIA requests during the meeting, to try to unearth some details of a matter observed at that meeting. Here&rsquo;s a brief update on some FOIA requests in progress. Washtenaw County Health Department. I&rsquo;m temporarily stymied in my quest to determine how often restaurants ask the county to change their inspection reports before they are published. An initial request came back with an estimate of $6000 to comb through every file in the department; an amended request looking for only 30 days of records only limited the cost to $1000. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-foia-update/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&rsquo;t have a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable response is &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;. There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&rsquo;s attainable for less than $6100. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As a first approximation, the number of open issues on an open source project that uses Github to track its issues is a metric of software complexity and project maturity. It&rsquo;s always worrisome to look at a project that has very few issues, because that&rsquo;s usually a signal that no one else is using the code. Every bit of software has incomplete features that prompt a request, and bugs looking for a fix. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-04-open-github-issues/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ann Arbor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open City Hall&rdquo; is a survey instrument used to gather answers to multiple choice questions.

It&rsquo;s run by Peak Democracy, which provides this same service to a number of municipalities. The current question under review is development on the Library Lot in downtown Ann Arbor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-open-city-hall/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Medium is a hosted blogging and discussion board at http://www.medium.com . It&rsquo;s run by Evan Williams, who built Blogger. The site is very pretty and functional, both for writers and for readers. Authors get a lovely HTML based editor to write their text in, and readers can do highlights and annotations. From a purely technical point of view it&rsquo;s one of the better systems for typing into on the net. Alas, the promise of a pretty system does not extend the promise that everything that&rsquo;s written there will be smart and interesting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-medium-pretty-but-disappointing/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>IRC is an old-school multi-system, multi-channel, multi-network chat infrastructure. It dates from the 1980s, and was inspired in part by the BITNET RELAY systems that effectively sent messages from mainframe to message over virtual punch cards. RFC 1459 described the protocol in 1993. Slack is a shiny new system also providing multi-channel, multi-network chat. It&rsquo;s very much a product of the 2010s, emerging in 2013 after being used for an internal communications channel at a games company. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-slack-vs-irc/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>CubicSDR is a software defined radio system for Mac, Linux, and Windows. It&rsquo;s at version 0.1.4-beta as of August 28, 2015, and you can download the binaries from https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4 or the source code from Github at https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR . My point of comparison for software defined radio is GQRX. When you put CubicSDR on the screen it has a very pretty waterfall display and relatively easy to sort out mouse commands, but it&rsquo;s lacking some of the fancier controls that a more mature program like GQRX has accumulated over time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software that&rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully noted. The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the stack until the software you had been using stops working. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-sudo-port-upgrade-outdated/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There are a lot of little boxes to type into on the Internet. Twitter and Facebook will gladly accept your text and send it out into the world. Medium is there if you want to be high minded, and Slack will let you narrow your message to a choice few. And there&rsquo;s always Github issues, any of thousands of projects will accept a comment on an issue, real or imagined. The burden of diligence of blogging is to stick to a single system over a long time, to drag around your past with you and keep it online, and to feed the system frequently enough that it (and you) are not forgotten. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-29-diligence/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m giving a talk on Over The Top Networks at the Radical/Networks conference in Brooklyn this weekend, October 24-25 2015. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to say in what order yet, but&hellip; the best way to predict that is to write down some notes. So here we go. The premise, briefly stated, is that most successful networks run &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; of existing working networks, and that you can learn a lot from what goes wrong along the way when the underlying network fights back. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-21-over-the-top-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A perspective on Ann Arbor area local government, as seen from fall 2015. The top level view is that local units of government are struggling with their technology investments, having a difficult time keeping them working, and are unwilling or unable to commit to any sort of &ldquo;open data&rdquo; initiatives as a result of their difficulties with basic operations. Some examples will illustrate. The City of Ann Arbor keeps track of a wide range of planning and permit documents through a vendor system called eTrakit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-14-the-state-of-the-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every month the Washtenaw County Health Department releases reports from a previous month&rsquo;s inspections of restaurants in the county. Restaurants are typically inspected twice a year. The inspector looks to see that the state Food Code is enforced, with a particular eye towards identifying violations that result in increased risk to the public of food-borne illness. Wayne Eaker has put together a searchable and browsable database of these inspections, which is online at food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com . <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-22-august-2015-food-inspections/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you are working on a project in Github, your work isn&rsquo;t always linear. Sometimes the change you make doesn&rsquo;t work completely, so you back a little bit of it out and move forward on a next part. It may take some hacking and sawing (and testing of course) to get a change that just works right. Projects like to have contributions, but project maintainers don&rsquo;t like to insert noise into their efforts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-22-git-squash/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Snap CI is a cloud-based continuous integration system. Like Travis CI, which I have written about here, it lives in the cloud, lets you run programs triggered by GitHub commits, and offers a testing environment for free for open source projects which lets you familiarize yourself with the system before deciding to pay for it for your non-open-source efforts. I&rsquo;m looking at all of these tools now because this weblog is now managed through a process that involves checking things into Github, which makes it completely suitable for automation for common tasks every time I save a file. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-22-snap-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn&rsquo;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. Leslie Lamport, 1987 Amazon Web Services DynamoDB experienced downtime in the N Virginia availability zone early Sunday morning, September 20, 2015. As a result, a number of other AWS services inside N Virginia that depend on DynamoDB also had downtime. Companies and organizations that built services on top of those systems who didn&rsquo;t have geographic load balancing were having problems as well. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-20-aws-dynamodb-downtime-sunday-am/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Travis CI is a continuous integration tool, a description which means nothing to people who have never used it. &ldquo;Continuous integration&rdquo; is one of these industry phrases that doesn&rsquo;t serve to illuminate the problem that it describes. Why would you care? Well, you&rsquo;re working on a project with a bunch of other people, and it&rsquo;s kind of complicated. It might depend on some old code that&rsquo;s fragile and should be tested all the time when it changes, or it might depend some brand-spanking new code that doesn&rsquo;t quite work and you know it doesn&rsquo;t work yet but you want the test system to be less tedious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-16-travis-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One of the problems with old codebases is that they are missing modern tooling for automated builds, automated testing, and the like. A second problem with old code is that the maintainers (absent modern tooling) may not know or recognize what dependencies they have. If an old package is not mostly self-contained, it&rsquo;s likely to have dependencies on other old code. This makes it hard to build, as those older dependencies have either gone offline or have mutated so that the old package doesn&rsquo;t work with the new releases. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-14-old-code-and-old-tools/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I use Twitter regularly, and will frequently post short things there that reflect some 140 character slice of what I&rsquo;m thinking about. That&rsquo;s very quick, but at some level deeply unsatisfying, because how much can you put into 140 characters? Never quite enough. The challenge is to write up your tweets into something longer. Take the quip and turn it into a lead paragraph, then expand the lead paragraph into three or five or fifteen or fifty more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-14-writing-up-your-tweets/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you have a Bluetooth device attached to a Linux system, it&rsquo;s not clear how to attach that device to a Docker container on that same system. bluez, the Bluetooth driver for Linux, uses the D-Bus to communicate. This is more complex than a FIFO or socket interface, and thus less easy to obviously say how it should be mapped into the Docker processs and file system space. The references below show several ways of not doing this task, and hopefully at some point will get answers on how to do it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-11-bluetooth-bluez-inside-docker/">&raquo;</a></p>
