They encourage you to join their effort, and no high technology is necessary. The network incorporates both readings from automated sensors (about £250) as well as manual readings from gaugeboards or photos.

In the interest of simplifying the presentation, some parts of this collection are currently offline, and the front page represents primarily current work and not a diversity of interests.
The current set of systems that are an area of focus - and the places I draw from for inspiration on each - are as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/about-this-weblog-2016/">&raquo;</a></p>

&ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&rdquo;
Really though it&rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&rsquo;s had a sale on kale for 99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it from the wrong bin, whatever.
Get home, cook the kale (it&rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&rsquo;t actually organic, and that I was overcharged. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-22-kale-into-ice-cream/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question of &ldquo;platform&rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt, it&rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for 2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.
This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar systems are next to each other. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-17-iot-platforms/">&raquo;</a></p>

I have this running in a staging environment and a test environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that it runs on a single host &amp; thus provides neither high availability in the case of Amazon funkiness nor scalability to handle lots of clients. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-16-openvpn-scaling/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich. That&rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies, even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.
Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need only point you at the Usenet Cookbook, developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year.
It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them.
Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!)
Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile. The topic of the conversation was roughly &ldquo;places to take a walk outside in the winter&rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include &ldquo;with a dog&rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get onto Arborwiki. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at Kodi as a possible software core for home media player for the living room. We have a whole rack of CDs and a shelf of LPs from our music-buying days, and I miss being able to listen to them.
Kodi is the software formerly known as XMBC, and XMBC is still the name of the foundation that supports the work. It runs on most systems, and there are several distributions of it specifically for systems like the Raspberry Pi. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-07-kodi-formerly-xmbc/">&raquo;</a></p>

Split tunnels are a VPN construction where instead of sending all of your traffic for the network in a single encrypted tunnel that collects everything, you instead route some traffic down the encrypted link and other traffic goes in the clear through your default connection.

            <p>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that I&rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.
The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&rsquo;re likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were trying to do in the first place. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-the-productity-oscillator/">&raquo;</a></p>

Hi Ed,
My name is Michael and I work at Nextdoor.
Recently it has come to our attention that there isn’t a Nextdoor for your neighborhood, and that you have registered in a nearby Nextdoor neighborhood.

I&rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &ldquo;stable&rdquo; branch.
Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task, with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&rsquo;s docker-openvpn is what I&rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from jpetazzo/dockvpn which solves the same problem slightly differently.
There&rsquo;s a tutorial on Digital Ocean that describes the setup including client-side support. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/">&raquo;</a></p>
