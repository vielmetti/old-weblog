<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly
removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and
social media reports. Social media users have reported that their
posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &ldquo;Tianjin&rdquo;
and &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo.
Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also
reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television
was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas.
Tianjin authorities banned reporters from sharing information about
the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites have been advised
to follow state media. The Tianjin Internet Police &ldquo;warned
social media users to stick to official reports about the number
of dead and injured&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A CNN correspondent, Will Ripley, who took photos outside TEDA
Hospital (Chinese: 泰达医院) was interrupted in a live report by
upset friends and relatives of victims killed and injured in the
blasts.</p>

      <p>Lunch at The Broken Egg with the a2b3 crew. We had 17 people show up,
which is about 2x what had been the normal attendance. The restaurant
was very accomodating, and everyone was well fed.</p>

<p>Organizing lunch is the highlight of my week.</p>

<p>Lots of things were discussed, here&rsquo;s a few of them:</p>

<p>The Perseid meteor shower peaked last night, notes Linda Diane Feldt,
who saw a few shooting stars from her cabin in Lyndon Township. I listened
to meteor scatter radio transmissions on <a href="http://www.livemeteors.com">http://www.livemeteors.com</a> which

August 29 @ 2:30 pm - 4:30 pm in Chelsea at Veterans Park.
The teams are the

<p>The Zingerman&rsquo;s partners meeting is an open meeting, and Tom Meloche
was there. He reported that it&rsquo;s a 2.5 hour event that&rsquo;s carefully
time-boxed, so that they cover everything without going over.</p>

      <p>Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&rsquo;d like to sort out how
to have more long form writing.</p>

<p>From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with
structure. It&rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring
a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome.</p>

<p>I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven
knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-07-all-watched-over-by-machines/">All watched over by machines</a>
      </h3>
      <p>As it turns out, a detailed look at the way you spend time over
the course of a day online yields several fascinating conclusions.
As previously noted, <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Wakatime</span> is the introspective tool of choice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gee, that&rsquo;s a lot of time to look at Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail;</li>
<li>Why aren&rsquo;t you spending more of your productive time writing;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll bet that if you put down the computer your day would be more productive.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, #2 is the most interesting one. Of course time spent on Facebook,
Twitter, and Gmail is time spent writing, but it&rsquo;s transactional writing -
short bursts of functional prose to negotiate a time, set up a plan,
make a clever comeback or otherwise do online chit-chat. The words are writing,
but there&rsquo;s not a body of work that you can point to that&rsquo;s of any size as
your opus from that hour plus spent.</p>

<p>Productive is a very funny word when you&rsquo;re being watched by a machine.
Some parts of the time are marked as &ldquo;good time&rdquo;, where you&rsquo;re happy to
have an extra minute spent credited to a project or task. Not all time is
&ldquo;good time&rdquo;, though some of the non-good time is just as essential, just
measured differently. And then there&rsquo;s the occasional glitch in the matrix
where time is credited or blamed on one thing but you could swear you were
doing something else at the time.</p>

<p>Time spent on task sometimes looks very small when all of these are taken into
account. Those 99 words you wrote for publication were edited down from 150,
and might be edited further down to 55. If you could precisely allocate all
of the time you spent on it it would include the musing and ruminations, but
that got chalked up to Gmail where it&rsquo;s mixed in with the time spent deleting
mail.</p>

<p>I like to know what I&rsquo;m doing, but it&rsquo;s wrong to mix up inputs and outputs.
If your system measures inputs, you get ritualized behavior designed to
maximize time spent on task, no matter how the time is actually used.
Maximizing outputs would yield word counts and not minute counts. If you&rsquo;re
slow and terse, there&rsquo;s no help for you.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-06-a2b3-mi-compadre-non-summary/">a2b3 lunch non-summary for August 6, 2015 at Mi Compadre</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">a2b3</span> lunch this week was at
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mi Compadre</span>, a Mexican place on Packard.
We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.</p>

<p>I was inspired this week for the lunch question by
going to the <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Workantile</span> lunch on Wednesday,
which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce
yourself around the table, and answer some simple question.
At Workantile the prompt was simply &ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&rdquo;,
and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery.</p>

<p>When lunches are well attended, it seems to be that it happens
because the news gets out in plenty of time and plenty of detail
on Facebook. Not everyone in my world does Facebook, but there&rsquo;s
more people there than on Twitter or Meetup, and it appears that
Facebook might now have the tools for lunch organizing that it didn&rsquo;t
have a year ago when I started using Meetup for that purpose.</p>

<p>So with the help of <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Tom Meloche</span> it looks like I&rsquo;m going
to move the primary ritual of notifying people where the next meeting is
through a Facebook event, and move away from Meetup as the primary organizing
tool. That&rsquo;s going to take a few months to pull off but it looks like
the right organizing tool for 2015.</p>

<p>I miss the olden days when <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">eGroups</span> was so novel that
you could build an instant community around an easy to run mailing
list. Yahoo so completely missed the boat when they turned that
into Yahoo Groups over a decade ago. I&rsquo;ll keep the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/a2b3">a2b3 Yahoo group</a> around indefinitely -
it&rsquo;s free after all, and it&rsquo;s old - but it&rsquo;s not growing and
working on a system that doesn&rsquo;t support growth is a recipe for
stagnatation. Where I used to count on a new person every week from
Yahoo Groups I now only get 10-15 new subscribers a year.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-05-wakatime/">wakatime, an automatic time tracker for programmers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Wakatime tracks your time if you&rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by
integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your
favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then
matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects
stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard.
&ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&rdquo; is the tag line.</p>

<p>That which is measured, improves. I don&rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve
your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind. What I do
know is that manually tracking your time is a pain, and that anything
you can do to manage to keep things running in your time accounting
system that doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of manual labor is very helpful.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that you generally don&rsquo;t spend all of your
time inside a text editor. (But maybe you should! Just think how much
more productive you&rsquo;d be.) Wakatime can be set up to also track you
in Chrome and pinpoint just how many hours per day get
absorbed by Twitter or Gmail or Facebook.</p>

<p>If I know myself, this is going to be a temporary enthusiasm. My
experience with the whole &ldquo;quanitifed self&rdquo; world is to know that
some months in the summer, my normal step count is well over 10000,
and that in the winter time it&rsquo;s well under 10000, just because of
Michigan&rsquo;s grey February. Benchmarking time spent sometimes makes you
work more mindfully, and sometimes just recognizes immutable human
issues that no amount of mechanical impetus will change.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every day, computers are making people easier and easier to use.
(David Tempkin, In Formation)</p>

<p><a href="https://x.ai?rf=8o4arg">x.ai</a> has a new service in development, an automated
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">personal assistant</span>
that helps you schedule meetings. You give it - or I should
say &ldquo;her&rdquo;, because the bot&rsquo;s name is <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Amy Ingram</span> -
you give Amy your calendar and some simple instructions, and &ldquo;she&rdquo;
manages the correspondence with the person you&rsquo;re trying to meet
with.</p>

<p>The service is very new, so new that it&rsquo;s the subject of breathless
enthusiasm about how wonderful it works in media accounts. Suddenly
people who never have had a personal assistant work for them get
access to an automaton who behaves like a well trained and inhumanly
efficient personal scheduler, and they get excited.</p>

<p>For what is a personal assistant anyway but a carefully programmed
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">protocol droid</span>,
something who knows the expressions that are used
to work your way onto someone&rsquo;s calendar. Having been trained with
the likes of Siri, we collectively know how useful it is to have a bot
teach us how to ask questions in an easy to parse, formalized way.
x.ai&rsquo;s Amy invokes all of our ritual behavior when it comes to understanding
how to deal with the gatekeepers to the powerful and busy, and wraps
that up in an algorithm.</p>

<p>Naturally I&rsquo;ve signed up to be on the beta.</p>

<p>Some press coverage:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248707">Human + A.I. = Your Business Future</a>,

<blockquote>
<p>When I get a response from Mindy, Tim, or Amy, I have no idea if
it was a human or machine that sent the message on their behalf.
With an assistants-as-app, the distinction between who&rsquo;s doing the
messaging isn&rsquo;t always clear — sometimes it&rsquo;s a bot and sometimes
it’s not.</p>

arranging meetings. In contrast to Apple&rsquo;s Siri, Google Now or
Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana, Amy is specialized on one thing and one thing
only: scheduling. A new and increasingly common type of software,
Amy isn&rsquo;t a program you download, or an app you install.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From there on in, organizing meetings became a breeze. Those who
didn&rsquo;t know me too well didn&rsquo;t question the fact that I was adding
Amy into our conversations. Those who did were just as incredulous
as Chris. One contact responded: &ldquo;Well if I’d known you had people
I would have got my people to speak to your people.&rdquo;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan
to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and
Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup
of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when
voter turnout is very low.</p>

<p>I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating
victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining
funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on,
or the perpetually politically curious.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After a few rounds of picking up result tapes from Ward Four precincts, I ended up
at Arbor Brewing Company which was Council Party HQ.</p>

<p>Winners:</p>

<ul>
<li>First Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Sabra Briere</span> over Will Leaf, handily with 70%+ of the vote,
though only 6% of registered voters actually voted.</li>
<li>Second Ward: We&rsquo;ll wait until the fall for this as Jane Lumm (I) meets
Sally Hart Petersen (D) in November.</li>
<li>Third Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Zachary Ackerman</span> defeats Steve Kunselman by about 40 votes.
This was the surprise of the night. Ackerman&rsquo;s entire margin of victory was
his strong showing in 3-3 (Burns Park) where he outpaced Kunselman 345-171.
Turnout was under 11%.</li>
<li>Fourth Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Jack Eaton</span> defeats Jamie Magiera with about 60% of the vote.
Jack held his party at Wolverine Brewing; Jamie was at ABC, looking subdued.
Turnout was about 10%.</li>
<li>Fifth Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Chip Smith</span> defeated Mike Anglin with about 55% of the vote.
Voter turnout in the mighty Fifth Ward was strong compared to the other wards,
with a mighty 14% of the electorate turning out to vote.</li>
</ul>

<p>Losers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 85%+ of Ann Arbor voters who didn&rsquo;t know enough or didn&rsquo;t bother
to turn out to vote.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>In the case of experts &ldquo;writing down what they know&rdquo;, and
incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base.</p>

<p>One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down
everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&rsquo;s
no internal inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The world usually works in such a way that it&rsquo;s changing fast enough
that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is
always holding as &ldquo;true&rdquo; in that memory bank something that is
demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under
them. Even if you have an iron-clad commitment to keeping the
memory bank narrowly scoped and revisiting every element of it to
refresh it periodically, the nature of written memory is to grow more and more
out of date or to consume more and more resources to keep fresh.</p>

<p>The map is not the territory - and even if by some miracle the map
at one time was perfectly matched with the world - the world changes
fast enough that we can&rsquo;t know any more than a small part of it.</p>

the face of reflecting changes in a city, by Brian Eno&rsquo;s quote
&ldquo;Forgetting is as important as remembering&rdquo;, and by
Jerry Michalski&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Brain&rdquo; magnum opus. Of course I forget where I
read the Eno quote, and a search for it turns up William James saying
the same thing in 1892, but Eno is easier to remember as a source.</p>

on S Industrial reported 1.12&rdquo; of rain, and at the peak of the storm rain
was coming down at 0.41&rdquo; in 15 minutes. The scanner was full of power
lines sparking and trees down.</p>

<p>Worst hit was the Sleeping Bear Dunes area, where some of the
adjacent communities had complete power blackouts. There was also a
tornado in the Thumb. The <a href="http://www.weather.gov/apx/2015Aug2recap">National Weather Service recap</a> for the August 2, 2015 storms gives much more detail.
Softball sized hail was seen near West Branch, MI.</p>

<p>Current 8:45 a.m. report is 60,318 DTE Energy customers without power, and
91,802 Consumers Energy customers without power. DTE does not generally
report outages by county, just by zip code, but I have all of the zip
codes so I should be able to estimate county level totals.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to,
in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&rsquo;s one
way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.</p>

<p>The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely
gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have
obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages.
Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of
content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many
advertisements as we will stand.</p>

<p>Still, blogrolls are useful as a quaint reminder of times past,
and how we once organized our reading in the days before efficient
newsfeeds became the rule of the day.  Look at the bottom of the
far left of this blog for mine.</p>

      <p><span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Knolling</span> is the practice of organizing things neatly, especially to
arrange things in parallel lines or at right angles.</p>

<p>Thanks to <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Jason Kottke</span> for the

<p>Previously spotted in a similar way, the &ldquo;5S&rdquo; process of getting
rid of clutter, especially &ldquo;seiton&rdquo; or &ldquo;neatness&rdquo;. Everything goes
into its own place. Knolling is a bit more freeform and does away
with explicit labels.</p>

<p>It does get me to thinking thought that I&rsquo;m very tired of some of the
presentation of screens that I look at all the time. My Gmail inbox is
always a simple list; would it not be that hard some time to make it a
grid of squares with people&rsquo;s photos in them, so that I could see at

      <p>In his <a href="http://cyber.jotwell.com/an-internet-x-ray-machine-for-the-masses/">An internet x-ray machine for the masses</a>, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">mitmproxy</span>,
a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to
get between your browser and the Internet and poke at
(and change) the traffic going between the two.</p>

<p><a href="http://mitmproxy.org">http://mitmproxy.org</a> is the home of mitmproxy. It&rsquo;s
the work of <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Aldo Cortesi</span> and a cast of
hundreds of contributors on github at <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy">https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy</a> .
I used the OS X binary distribution from the download page.
There&rsquo;s also a nifty Dockerized version on
Dockerhub as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/">docker pull mitmproxy/mitmproxy</a>
to get you started quickly too.</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (or monkey-in-the-middle) systems are not
new, of course, and Dug Song&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">dsniff</a>
package dates to 1999. What we&rsquo;ve learned in a decade and a half
is that security through obscurity vanishes in the face of better
tools for looking at network traffic as it&rsquo;s going by with high
level tools for making sense of what&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>As ever, all of these tools have both benign and malicious uses.
If you can trick someone into using your proxy server for their
traffic, all kinds of foolishness can result. Better is the use
that you proxy your own traffic and behold all of the cookies,
beacons, and ads that sneak into your everyday browsing experience.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-soundcloud/">Soundcloud, now and in the future</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If you have exactly one copy of something and it&rsquo;s only on Soundcloud,
this would be an opportune time to make a backup. That&rsquo;s always a good
idea anyway not to rely on single web servers for anything, but it&rsquo;s
especially notable in the light of these articles.</p>

<p>First, the upbeat <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-10/can-soundcloud-be-the-facebook-of-music-">Bloomberg Business</a> article of July 10, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; SoundCloud’s potential is fascinating, and perhaps unique.
The founders have ambitious goals that respond to changes in the
way music and sound are created and consumed. It’s a beautiful
dream. So long as all the crucial participants—labels, publishers,
artists, SoundCloud itself—can agree on how to share it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, the downbeat <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/72325/20150729/soundcloud-losing-money-fast-as-record-labels-apply-licensing-pressure.htm">Tech Times</a> on July 29, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recently reported on rumors that popular music streaming service
SoundCloud is planning on adding a subscription-based tier to its
currently all-free streaming service, and that rumor was just
confirmed by company co-founder Eric Wahlforss in a conversation
with the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears that the impetus
behind the development of the subscription tier is clear: the company
is in dire need of cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Dire need of cash&rdquo; because record labels are not thrilled with
the beautiful dream of listening to the world&rsquo;s music for free.
Remember how Napster turned out? It was a beautiful dream, too,
but labels and publishers just saw it as piracy. This from
<a href="http://www.edmtunes.com/2015/06/editorial-believe-it-or-not-soundcloud-is-fighting-the-good-fight/">EDM Tunes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2015 SoundCloud controversy is Napster all over again. We
aren’t sharing files anymore, we’re sharing sound. 15 years ago
record labels objected to us downloading their music, now they
object to us streaming it&hellip;.</p>

<p>Like Napster, SoundCloud is a goldfish that’s been unwillingly
thrust into battle with three super-wale companies. Just for a
matter of reference, consider that SoundCloud has about 200 employees,
while the Sony, Universal, and Warner corporate networks employ
more than 200,000. At this point, SoundCloud is fighting to survive,
and unfortunately has received a lot of critical media attention.
Since its 2007 inception, SoundCloud has served as a haven for
electronic music producers and fans; allowing sound to be seamlessly
shared from artist to listener. This luxury is being threatened,
and we’re all pissed about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, enjoy Soundcloud while you can, and when you are producing things
for it make sure you keep a backup on your own machines!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two
people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away.
I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).</p>

<p>The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&rsquo;m thinking about
quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch
a postcard from the command line of my Mac. It&rsquo;s got to be easier (so I don&rsquo;t
have to look up command line options) but the basic structure works pretty well.</p>

<p>Postcards are archaic, perhaps, and also perhaps more expensive per each than
reaching someone through Facebook advertising. I do have to say though that I
love sending them, and love receiving them in return. I&rsquo;d love to do the experiment
of $20 spent on Facebook vs $20 spent on postcards, and wonder what the return
would be; or better yet, $20 spent on each and identify particular synergies between
super-high-tech and old-fashioned.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The card I got in the mail today was from Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain,
two of my faithful correspondents. They sent a photo of the Pickle Barrel House Museum
in Grand Marais, Michigan. The historic marker there reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pioneer Cooperage Company of Chicago designed this small
vacation cottage, which stood on the shores of nearby Sable Lake
from 1926 until about 1937. It was built for William Donahey, creator
of the Chicago Tribune cartoon story The Teenie Weenies. The house
was constructed as a typical barrel would have been, only on a much
larger scale. The main barrel contained a living area on the first
floor and a bedroom on the second. A pantry connected this barrel
to a smaller single-story one, which housed a kitchen. Donahey spent
ten summers at the cottage with his wife, Mary, herself a noted
author of children&rsquo;s books. The structure was then moved to its
current site and used as a tourist information center. The Pickle
Barrel House is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a destination for next time!</p>

      <p>A first round of postcards sent via Lob.com have arrived or are

sending them made it clear that I need to do some simple user

on producing the card back photo, but again there&rsquo;s more work to be
done making the text on the page wonderful.</p>

<p>A reasonable question is, why do you send them? Why not send
email or a Facebook message? The answer is fairly simple, no one
ever remarks on my email prowess but even an ordinary card
elicits a response.</p>

      <p>I bought a little box of
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">tomatillos</span>
from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them.</p>

<p>Suggestions so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter</li>
<li>roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/raw-tomatillo-salsa/">raw tomatillo salsa</a> a la Rick Bayless</li>

<li>baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro</li>
<li>carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti</li>
<li>in pastel de Montezuma</li>
</ul>

<p>What I ended up making was a very simplified version of
<a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/tomatillo_breakfast_tacos.html">Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos</a>,
reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs.
Cook chopped onions and chopped tomatillos over medium
heat (6 of 10) until the tomatillos are soft and the
onions are browned, about 12 minutes. Crack some eggs over the top of the
mixture and cover. Cook without stirring until the eggs are
set to your desired doneness.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad.
The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&rsquo;ve
been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes
and what-not. It&rsquo;s a chance to review old words.</p>

<p>One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at
times system called <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>. Zemanta would
figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions
for related links, both to things that you had written as well as
to things other people had written.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided as part of the transformation of the old weblog into
the new one to unlink those &ldquo;related links&rdquo;, in the hope that
eventually Hugo&rsquo;s own system will create some either algorithmically
derived relations or at least an easier way to do that by hand.</p>

<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;m looking closely at what Zemanta did so I can
undo it. The first set of artifacts is a &ldquo;fieldset&rdquo; with its links,
and that&rsquo;s easy enough to search and destroy. Occasionally but not
always I find my links decorated with a <code>class=&quot;zem_slink&quot;</code> marker
that&rsquo;s a little harder to find. Most insidious so far was exactly
one time where Zemanta (or Typepad) rewrote or wrote an Amazon link
to include an affiliate link points to Zemanta, and not to me.</p>

<p>Rewriting 1500+ pages is going to take a while. The biggest question
is unpublishing some of them, since time has passed and I don&rsquo;t need
to republish everything. There&rsquo;s conversion from HTML to Markdown
to remove the uglies, spelling errors to catch, next
categories and taxonomies to fill, layout to work on, etc. At
some point I need to sort out image management. But first I&rsquo;m going
to understand the consequences of previous convenience decisions
I made to use Zemanta and to undo that decision.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wrote a tiny R script that generates maps. The challenge
today is to find a portable environment so that I can deploy this script
on shared infrastructure. The project took 30 minutes of MacBook Air processor
time running full blast parallel, and while I don&rsquo;t care about wall clock time
to complete the effort I do care about building something that I can hand
off to someone else to run.</p>

<p>The hope is that the <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/ropensci">ropensci</a> Docker
package from the Rocker project is the answer, or most of the answer, for this.
Rocker has built R images where lots of useful packages have been installed,
including systems where the install directions are a little bit complex.</p>

<p>With all complicated software environments the biggest challenge is dealing
with dependencies. If you want to use the latest and greatest fast algorithms,
you have to be prepared to spin up on what the cool kids are doing in the
rest of their environment. If somehow you can jump to the edge of the development
in the algorithm world without being tripped up by the hairy dependency graph
that got you there, it can be a lot more fun.</p>

<p>So; install Docker on the Mac with &lsquo;boot2docker&rsquo;; then</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">docker pull rocker/ropensci
docker run -it rocker/ropensci R
</code></pre>

<p>and poof, you have an environment current to this month&rsquo;s desktop of leading
R developers.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-22-little-bird/">Starting a trial of Little Bird</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Little Bird is a system that helps you discover influencers
and experts in any topic. I&rsquo;m at the very start of a 7 day trial.
Marshall Kirkpatrick is CEO of Little Bird, and he has been
active on Twitter posting interesting ideas about influence
marketing - and given that it seemed prudent to give the product a try.</p>

<p>Pricing is aimed at agencies, not individuals, so I&rsquo;m going
to look at this product through the eyes of people doing
&ldquo;social listening&rdquo; for a living, tracking the messages that
appear on a topic and either quietly making sense of what
is happening or actively engaging with those people to try
to influence their opinions. The single user price is out of
my reach for an annual commitment, though I might keep it up
for another month if I can find a specific task that warrants
the extra tooling.</p>

<p>My first test with any social software is to point it at a domain
that I know (Ann Arbor) and see what it unearths. Little Bird
found for me 1000 influential accounts having to do with Ann Arbor,
and in a boost to my ego it puts me in the top 50. Without understanding
how the algorithms work it seems that it biases towards identifying
busy accounts that post a lot of news, vs. the clever individual
whose every post is good but who doesn&rsquo;t post that often.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a style of posting which I would have to describe as
&ldquo;thinkfluential&rdquo; which Little Bird has a nose for. The thinkfluencer
will post frequently on a given topic, and a lot of people will
retweet them and they will retweet a lot of people. Every message
is relentlessly on message and you won&rsquo;t find cat pictures or
meeting banter mixed in. More often than not you&rsquo;ll see the
thinkfluence augmented by robots that post newsy things day and
night, even when the thinkfluencer is away from the keyboard.
There doesn&rsquo;t even need to be any interaction at all with this
&ldquo;expert&rdquo;, just a never-ending confluence of thinkfluence.</p>

<p>So I wish that Little Bird had another round of filters, to help me
understand the question at scale &ldquo;is this person really a bot&rdquo;.
The real utility for me of identifying expertise is not to pick
out the high-frequency posting bot, but to suss out who on a topic
is good at engaging on the things they know about. Bot identification
is the Turing Test at work, and maybe just maybe there&rsquo;s a set of
computable metrics that you can build across a corpus of Twitter
users to pull that out.</p>
