      </h3>
      <p>Dr. Dobb's Journal is closing down, with its last issue appearing at the end of 2014. They <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">tell their story</a> in a final report.</p>

<p>The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side, our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My memory of reading Dr. Dobb's dates back to the early 1990s, when it was a source for careful writing (complete with source code) on programming issues of the day. Now days there's an infinite supply of technical writing on the net, so it's not surprising that ad revenues dried up (or more pointedly got concentrated on Google the gatekeeper for much of online traffic).</p>

<p>"Running light without overbyte" was their first slogan. You can pick up a first edition of their compiled first year of publication (1976) from <a href="http://www.kuenzigbooks.com/pages/books/22185/dr-dobb/dr-dobbs-journal-of-computer-calisthenics-orthodontia-running-light-without-overbyte-volume-one">Kuenzig Books</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.</p>

<p>websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. There are websdr servers running around the globe, each tuned in to some particular slice of the radio waves. Multiple people can tune in at the same time and hear their own piece of the airwaves.</p>

<p>The interesting thing happens when you connect these two systems together. Some small number of the websdr receivers tune into the 2 meter band, which is the typical band used by Echolink. Using Echolink (or in my case the Mac application Echomac) I identified an Echolink host in the vicinity of the websdr receiver, then connected to it. Sure enough, I was able to hear my call sign back in through the websdr front end.</p>

<p>This little image shows the result. Transmitted via DM0ZHS, and monitored at http://129.187.5.188:8901/ on 145237.50 kHz, I'm sending from Isen, Germany and receiving the transmission at the Olympic Tower in Munich, Germany.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gall, John C. 9/18/1925 - 12/15/2014 Walker, MN John C. Gall, Jr.,
beloved husband, father, pediatrician, scholar and author, passed
away with his wife by his side Dec. 15, 2014, in Walker, MN, from
natural causes. He was 89. John was born on September 18, 1925 in
Washington, D.C. and grew up near Upperville, VA. In 1945 he was
drafted into the Army Air Corps and sent to Germany, where he served
as a medic in the Allied army of occupation. During his tour of
duty he attended the Nuremberg trials, which kindled in him a
lifelong passion to heal the afflicted and promote justice. Upon
returning home he furthered his education, graduating from Yale and
George Washington University Medical School. He was a postdoctorate
fellow at the Mayo Clinic, where he was dubbed &ldquo;the best pediatric
diagnostician [they had] ever seen!&rdquo; In addition he earned a
certification in Human Genetics and completed 7 years of therapy
training. Dr. Gall began his medical career as a researcher at the
University of Virginia, followed by a 3-year stint at the Geisinger
Clinic in Danville, PA. He next went into private practice in Miles
City, MT, but was soon invited to teach at the University of Michigan
Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. There he also served as head of
the Plymouth State Home, where he did research partially funded by
the Kennedy family foundation, and named and described several
syndromes of the developmentally disabled . In addition he established
a long-running private pediatric practice of 38 years. During this
period he developed a special appreciation for, and an enduring
interest in, the importance of nonverbal communication between very
young children and their parents. This led him to expand his practice
to include support and education classes, in which he was aided by
his late wife, Beth, and then by his wife Carol. Their observations
and anecdotes are included in Elegant Parenting, written with wife,
Beth; in Dancing with Elves written by John, and with wife Carol
he wrote Hit by a Low-Flying Goose. John&rsquo;s best known book is System
Antics, later published under the title The Systems Bible, a humorous
but insightful study of the problems and pitfalls that afflict every
type of system that human beings create-whether mechanical, economic,
corporate, aeronautical, legal, linguistic, religious, medical or
electronic. It was first published in 1976 by the New York
Times/Quadrangle Press and has been translated (officially or
unofficially) into at least 14 languages. He lectured widely
throughout the United States and was interviewed by the Voice of
America on nuclear proliferation issues after its publication. John
and Carol were both invited to speak in London in 2012 to a group
of CEOs and other executives from around the world and John was
introduced as &ldquo;The Grandfather of Systems Theory.&rdquo; He retired to
Walker, MN, in 2001 in search of privacy and uninterrupted time,
which he used to write seven other books, including a novel, First
Queen, plus books and video books on parenting and the art of
pediatric practice. He was very proud that the great Swiss psychiatrist,
Alice Miller, who introduced the world to the subject of child
sexual abuse, endorsed his work before she died. His work has also
been endorsed by others too numerous to name, but including such
luminaries as the head of the Dept. of Psychology at Cambridge,
University, who forwarded his material to several British social
service agencies. In the late 1990s John helped to write the National
Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Exam in Washington D.C several years
running. More recently he was invited to Washington D.C. by a
government psychiatrist and consulted with this man on the development
of psychological profiles of moles (double agents). He also spoke
at a symposium at Princeton University entitled &ldquo;Children under the
Shadow of War.&rdquo; The group included scholars from around the world,
and filmmakers who had photographed kidnapped children who had been
conscripted into war and forced to commit atrocities. It was John&rsquo;s
job to deliver the final speech, summarizing and tying together all
of the presentations. This was the only lecture open to the public.
John gave a moving presentation that left not a dry eye in the
audience. In the final months of his life, John continued to think
and write actively on a wide range of subjects. Most recently he
completed a 4th edition of Systemantics and contributed, with other
international scholars, to a book on Panarchy, due to be published
in 2015. John was preceded in death by his first wife, Beth, and
three step-grandsons, Michael Nelson, and Franklin and Alexander
Sawvel. His is survived by his wife, Carol, brothers Dr. Joseph
Gall (Diane Dwyer) and Howard, sons Duane (Valerie) and David
(Suzette), step-sons Steven (Sarah) and Terrell (Eleanor) Nelson,
and grandchildren Izzie, Nathan, Sebastian, and Simone, plus
step-grandchildren Anthony, Cody, Alaya, Nicole, and Branden Nelson.
A private family ceremony will be held in the Episcopal Church in
Upperville, VA, in the late spring.  -</p>

      <p>Nothing personal, but it's time to take a break from Twitter.</p>

<p>I tried to do this <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">back in 2008</a> when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates.</p>

<p>I have a few bots that tweet out weather updates which I guess I will keep running because it's more trouble than it's worth to temporarily turn them off. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out
that the routine I have with Google's Gmail for handling inbound
correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail
to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.</p>

<p>I don't know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect,
but it seems to be pretty good. Email comes in, I read it, and anything
that deserves further attention but can't be handled right away is
starred. The next round of handling works its way through the starred 
messages, and when something in that queue is stuck and needs more
attention than I can get to at the moment it goes into a Github issue.
Periodically I work through Github, sort out some priority items,
and try to crank through the queues. </p>

<p>The problem with systems is that they periodically fail. My system works
OK as well as it goes, but it can fall down when I get a whole series of
messages from one person right one after the other. I'm accustomed to a
routine where in most cases there's one or two things outstanding that need
to be resolved on any ongoing conversation, and the burst of unanswered
email gets in the way of that effort. </p>

<p>If you have a system that allows you to accumulate a queue, there will
inevitably be delays. I like being absolutely on top of my inbox and able
to answer queries as they come in, and there's some basic capacity in
messages per hour that I can process when I'm "on". Even emptying out a
queue into an issue tracker can take time, and thus inevitably there's
some things that don't get done instantly. </p>

<p>In periodic posts to Twitter I try to track my backlog. In truth there's
always something that will cause an event in my todo list to be overtaken
by events, at a pace of about one or two a day. The key mostly for me is
just to keep things flowing through, and to try very hard not to get so
bogged down in the moment that I can't tackle tougher tasks that actually
need more than 10 minutes of concentration.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues.
By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status.
This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well
as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.</p>

<p>I've been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while,
using its milestones feature to track categories. This has been mostly
a one-dimensional exercise of managing very long lists, or shorter lists.
It's been cumbersome to use either labels or milestones to handle the quick
need to say to yourself "I'm going to focus on this now" without the issue
sinking back quickly into a mile-long undifferentiated list.</p>

<p>Enter a whole series of Github add-ons that all add a similar feature, the kanban-style
column view. I'll list them here with any experience I currently have using
them. My best bet is that at some point Github absorbs one of these and makes 
it its own, but that is tempered by the realization that Github issues really
isn't changing much as a product.</p>

<p>Zenhub, <a href="https://www.zenhub.io/">zenhub.io</a>. This is a Google Chrome plugin, which gives you a kanban-style view of your issues. It only works in Chrome. I tried it, but didn't see an easy way to configure which columns referred to which labels, and after a few tries gave up on it.</p>

<p>Waffle, <a href="https://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a>. At the moment this is what I'm using. You authenticate to it with Github, and then it displays your issues. Free (for now), they are advertising that it will be $7/mo for private repos, which is what I currently pay for all of the rest of Github.</p>

<p>Huboard, <a href="https://huboard.com">huboard.com</a>. Free for open source repos or $7/mo/user for private repos. 14 day free trial. </p>

<p>Blossom, <a href="https://www.blossom.io">blossom.io</a>. No free plan, 14 day trial, minimum is a 5 user plan at $22/mo.</p>

<p>Task Tub, <a href="http://www.tasktub.com/">tasktub.com</a>. Company page does not load.</p>

<p>SweepBoard, <a href="http://sweepboard.com/">sweepboard.com</a>. Free for open source projects.</p>

<p>When I first started finding these sorts of things, I didn't really realize that it was a whole category of products. Most of them have some other features beyond the kanban to add to Github as a project management tool. I don't think there's a category winner, but if you are interested in visualizing your work and taking your todo list beyond the simple long list this is a useful set of tools to explore.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Twitter, especially. A search this morning for "ann arbor ice" gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around. Streets and highways were bad, and a Delta flight slid off the runway at DTW. For Michigan weather follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/miwx">#miwx</a> hashtag.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Maps with the "traffic" overlay. Zoom way out, and you'll see splotches of red, showing where traffic is moving at significantly lower than posted speeds; zoom in, and you get recent reports from motorists using Waze reporting specific incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Broadcastify's "top feeds". Here you count on citizens monitoring public safety traffic to give you an idea of what kinds of places are working a lot of incidents. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/top">top feeds</a> can also be set up to generate alerts on your phone if you use their mobile app.</p></li>
<li><p>Power outage maps, for when storms and incidents get really bad. There's no one single source to go to, but if you can figure out which utility company covers an area, their outage map is a good measure of storm location or path and intensity.</p></li>
<li><p>The morning's problem was ice. An unusual and good map of ice risk is the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">SPIA Index</a>, a metric that combines an ice forecast with a wind forecast to predict damage. </p></li>

      </h3>
      <p>Some questions to ask while you're trying to sort this out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end
to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the
parts that "just work", because undoubtably there are 
unexpected cases that won't work just when you need them 
to work. </p></li>
<li><p>Identify the message flows through the system.
Where do signals get generated, where do they get
retransmitted, where do they get changed and when
does a human interpret them? Look for feedback loops,
where messages oscillate between two parts of a system.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what kind of time scale you need to operate
on, and understand the characteristics of delays within
the system. Identify the cycle time of critical components,
how often they can be queried and especially how long it
takes to return an accurate reading. </p></li>
<li><p>Form follows funding. Understand the financial flows
through the system that constrain the data flows. If a
process costs money, sort out the planning and
budgeting implications of making a change. Systems that
are subject to external regulation may have unexpected
constraints on operations and reporting, </p></li>
<li><p>Complex working systems are in a perpetual state of
partial failure, and often the resolution of partial failures
involves human inputs. Consider the human element in
the systems design, and draw that into your functional
design.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's possible to overthink all of these, and some of the
parts decompose into smaller parts that are in turn rather
complex. Inside every complex working system is a simpler
system that works, and you are looking to identify that at
the core of your efforts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. That's a pretty typical pattern for me
these days, and I'm trying to make sense of whether it's a good one.</p>

<p>The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out
what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours.
There are lots of competitors for the morning attention, including yesterday's
inbox, the overnight news, and the steady tick of Twitter and Facebook. You could
sit and just read things for a while and not get anything in particular done.</p>

<p>One element of morning focus could be simply on churning out something - anything -
that was a sign of progress towards a goal. This doesn't even need to be anything
substantial, just a morning wakeup exercise to get the keys moving. I experimented
with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750wordscom-a-writing-environment-for-a-daily-writing-exercise.html">750 Words</a>, a system designed for just this
daily writing exercise. That was ultimately unsatisfying, though I like the idea
the details didn't work out. This effort gets called "Morning Pages" which I guess
justifies as part of a writer's craft.</p>

<p>Daily work is hard, hard work. It asks you to be able to tune in and focus
each and every day, whether or not you woke up with that idea in mind. Carving
out that chunk of the day, committing to a specific goal, tracking your progress
towards the goal (without the tracking being its own burden), and following through
in the absence of some easy feedback. </p>

<p>I read my own advice about doing things frequently and sometimes I laugh at my
own cheery suggestions. "Write about the same thing twice a day", I cheerily suggest in the <a href="http://vielmettti.typepad.com/secret">Blogger's Secret</a>, "and do that for six months". OK, which thing? What happens if two weeks into this commitment you discover that it's not the right thing to do?</p>

<p>So wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. Produce something. If you need to determine how it fits into a bigger plan, do your edits in the afternoon.</p>

      </h3>
      <h1>wjchat is a weekly Wednesday night chat session on Twitter. "wj"</h1>

<p>in this case is short for "web journalism". Tonight's session is on
using social media for long term editorial projects.</p>

<p>The longest long-term editorial project I'm working on that's relevant
to this is Arborwiki, which is now part of the Localwiki project. It's
a local encyclopedia of the Ann Arbor area, and as such it's a very
useful spot to accumulate the back story for any story that you want to
tell. It's an ideal place to write the little biographical sketch for
someone who's in the news, to write up a brief history of important issues,
or to collect public records that help you understand the ins and outs
of some ongoing project. The effort started in 2005 and is still going strong.</p>

<p>I've gotten so accustomed to having a wiki as an outboard memory
that I understand that if I don't write something down, I'm not
likely to be able to find it again. That impulse is tempered by the
realization that writing it down might take an appreciable amount of
time, since the value of a fragment or an incomplete image is limited.</p>

<p>The biggest headache of any long-term editorial project is that it's
very hard to get the exact right point of view expressed so that if
you walk away from the thing you're working on for a year or two that
you can come back to it and bring it up to date easily. The durable
pages look like a "tick-tock" with a heavy emphasis on a timeline and
much less in the way of explanation. If you can at least get a solid
timeline nailed down, you can at least pick up the story (in non-wiki,
proper story form) after leaving it and be have some good backstory to pick
and choose from.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm working on a project that will remain nameless. The sponsor of the
project asked me not to write about it, and I agreed. I'm spending a lot
of time communicating about the project, but those communications are
all private. It's intensely frustrating.</p>

<p>I learn best by writing about what I'm doing, in enough detail to capture
some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening.
There's no better way for me to learn - and to teach - than by documenting
the bits and pieces as I go, while they are still fresh. I write in a form
that's framed so that the pieces which are sharable are shared widely,
and if there's anything private that gets edited out. I've learned to do this
over time, and when it works, it works well.</p>

<p>When you write things down for the world to see, such as in this weblog or
carefully for Twitter, you get the benefit of fast feedback. People can see
what you are interested in, and you can reach out to them with something
relevant on the front page of what they see when they look for you. If there
are questions that are top of mind they can go to the top of the page. It's
a very effective way to take advantage of introductions, and to reach out
beyond people you know.</p>

<p>Without the ability to write things down it's easy to flounder. You end up
reviewing ground that you had gone over before because you forgot it, and
didn't write it down somewhere you could find it. Decisions that were made
and observations that were agreed on get revisited sometimes endlessly because
there's no contemporaneous record of the conclusion. Obscure details that
you want to follow up on later get wiped out. </p>

<p>This particular project has an internal communications tool, which will also
remain nameless. It's a stylized, formalized, cartoonish caricature of what
people actually use in real life, and it's designed to maximize management
visibility into the process rather than the utility of the process to the goal.
In many ways it reminds me of other systems I've been forced into where the
sole measure of progress was the easiest thing to measure, and all of your
hard qualitative work gets squeezed down into a single number (number of 
transactions, queue depth) that bears very little resemblance to anything useful.</p>

<p>I've written before about systems and why they fail; that's actually part of
my 140 character Twitter biography. Here the failures probably are on my part,
for not understanding the project expectations before starting, and not being
able to exit gracefully before the effort is over. The whole effort has given
me a sour taste. Most importantly, I understand sadly that being asked not to
write has been to cut off the most important part of what I can contribute to
an effort, and in retrospect I should have walked out of the room when that happened.</p>

      <p>Note to self: if you get asked to be part of a project, 
and then subsequently get asked to not talk about that
project, renegotiate the terms of that effort promptly.
Non-disclosure has wide ranging consequences, and that's
especially true when you habitually learn about how
something works by writing about it. </p>

<p>In retrospect, I should have walked out of the room.
That would have been brave and not foolish.</p>

<p>I'm not one of those people.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A cautionary tale.</p>

<p>What's the value of an idea? Consider that some ideas might have a negative value; indeed that most of them might. It may take you some substantial investment to test out your idea, to prove it, to build something minimal to show people that it was real. And then when you're ready with it there might be a net result that you finally have talked to enough people that you know that you need to scrap it and start over.</p>

<p>If then I am skeptical of your great new project and want to be critical of it first rather than embrace it, it's not because I don't think that you should be at all ashamed or sad to have come up with anything good. It's more for me - this is the first step of defensiveness that will help me not get involved.</p>

<p>Please, if I pitch something in your direction, try to dissuade me from doing it. Tell me that no one has done it, or that everyone has done it, or that there's no customers, or that it would cost too much to try, or that it can't scale, or whatever. Shake me out of my temporary enthusiasm. I can generate a lot of ideas that each might take $25,000 to prove out, and the faster I can get to "no" the happier I'll be.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Update: The list below is of individuals and organizations that have requested the Absentee Voter file (AV file) for the most recent Ann Arbor election.</p>

<p>The file includes the full names and addresses of individuals who have requested absentee ballots, as well as the status of the ballot in the current election (whether it has been voted yet or not). Political campaigns use this information to identify likely voters for campaign mailings. The information is very personal, in the sense that it includes full names including middle names and home addresses.</p>

<p>The City of Ann Arbor redacted a request for the names of individuals who have asked for this personal information, citing personal privacy issues in their arbitrary redaction of names seen below.</p>

<p>-- </p>

<p>Steve,</p>

<p>This is an appeal of FOIA 14-315.</p>

<p>I appeal all redactions in this document.</p>

<p>Some names and email addresses in the document are redacted, but others are not. This
practice is arbitrary and is specifically prohibited by statute.</p>

<p>In addition, the records have been previously released to others; see
e.g. the email copied below from Matt Morrow on August 2. Disclosure
of public records to some individuals but not others is similarly arbitrary
and is in violation of statute.</p>

<p>The city's ongoing arbitrary policy of redaction, as previously noted
by Dave Askins of the Ann Arbor Chronicle, is a practice which is 
unduly expensive and time-consuming for both citizens and staff.</p>

<p>thank you</p>

<blockquote>
The theory posited by “the kid who started Doxbin“ to nachash was that the attack was an attempt to force connections to the site’s various .onion addresses to follow paths that went over Tor network nodes set up by law enforcement. By filling up the “circuits” through secure Tor network nodes, law enforcement operatives could have made it possible to connect to the services only through Tor routing servers they controlled—allowing them to see the real Internet Protocol address of the server hosting them.

<p>In general, beware any service that provides security, because any users of that service become targets.</p>

<p>More about the song The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald on the <a href="http://70spop.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/the-wreck-of-the-edmund-fitzgerald-by-gordon-lightfoot-reprise-1976/">70s Pop</a> blog.</p>

<blockquote>
Death and destruction: why were we so obsessed with it in the 70s? So many gruesome, heart wrenching unhappy endings were fodder for pop songs and we gleefully bought the 45s. Well maybe not gleefully, maybe with a maudlin curiosity. This Gordon Lightfoot tune is a great example, a story song about the SS Edmund Fitzgerald sinking in 1975, killing everyone on board. Almost exactly one year to the date of this tragedy, the tune made it all the way up to #2, which was an accomplishment in itself being that the edited version was still 6 minutes long. Radio stations played this song rather than 2 other 3 minute songs because that’s how riveting Gordo’s performance was.

      <p>Fournier, Thomas James 6/27/1925 - 11/7/2014 </p>

<p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/Tom_Fournier">Tom Fournier</a> died peacefully with family by his side on November 7, 2014. </p>

<p>Tom was born on June 27, 1925 in Detroit, MI, to Christopher and Alice Fournier. He joined the Navy to fight in World War II and fought in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach. After the war, Tom returned home to marry the love of his life, Joan, on June 1, 1946. Tom was proud of his wartime service and of the many accomplishments in his life including pursuing his doctoral degree in counseling. He loved to write stories about the many people he met; he loved to go camping; he loved to cook especially desserts. Tom was outgoing and made many friends in and around Ann Arbor, his beloved home town. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>November 2, 2014, 5:04 p.m. EST (Ann Arbor, MI): The state of Maine is being hit by winter storms, with more than 1 inch an hour falling across parts of the state. This has led to widespread power outages, as well as outages of the power outage maps provided by Emera and by Central Maine Power, two utility companies that serve the state.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0891fec970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0891fec970c img-responsive" style="width: 518px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Mcd1902-2014" title="Mcd1902-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0891fec970c-550wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://apps.bhe.com/about/outages/Outage_Map.cfm">Emera's live outage map</a> is throwing an error at this time. The latest <a href="http://www.emeramaine.com/outages-and-restoration/current-outage-reports/">current outage report</a> on their web site is dated 9:26 a.m., with a promise of more up to date info at 4:00 p.m. that has not materialized. </p>

<p>UPDATE 4:49 p.m. November 2, 2014 from Emera:</p>

<blockquote>
As of 4:00 p.m. more than 38,000 Emera Maine customers were without power, the result of strong gusty winds and heavy, wet snow weighing down on tree limbs and trees on power lines, especially in Penobscot and Hancock Counties. The utility has declared a system emergency and additional crews are being brought in from our Northern Operating Region and New Brunswick.  Crews which had been placed on standby in anticipation of the storm were fully deployed as of this morning.
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://outagemap.cmpco.com/maine/?style=maine#">Central Maine Power outage viewer</a> is also offline, but at least they have an <a href="http://www.cmpco.com/outages/outageinformation.html">outage information page</a> as text that describes how 79,310 customers are offline as of 5:12 p.m.</p>

<p>When the power goes out, people use their cell phones to check on system status. It's not acceptable performance by an electrical utility company to not be able to serve the public by providing this information online when it's most needed.</p>

      <p>Where do you write something that's longer than a tweet, but shorter than an essay?</p>

<p>There's a space on the net for things that you put together that don't fit into a tweet, but that also don't really require a whole long essay.</p>

<p>I've been writing these in my blog for years, and so I have a bit of infrastructure put together for organizing, collecting, and finding them again. A lot of people who are on Twitter don't have a blog, though, and so their fragments stay fragmentary or get lost in the mists of Twitter time.</p>

<p>There are plenty of places to post disconnected paragraphs online - you can stick them on Facebook (where they will be quickly seen and quickly lost), you can dump them into a Github gist (where only techies will be able to find them again), or - best of all - you can use your own web space in some blog-like time-sequenced away to push things into the world for later retrieval.</p>

<p>Some other people talking about this at the moment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gina Trapani: <a href="http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/">I find tweets too reductionist and Medium pieces too bloviating</a></li>
<li>Marco Arment: <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/11/01/short-form-blogging">Too much of my writing in the last few years has gone exclusively into Twitter. I need to find a better balance.</a></li>
<li>Andy Baio: <a href="http://waxy.org/2014/10/middling/">I miss seeing people I admire post stuff longer than a tweet.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It was noted by several people that Tumblr fits this pattern well; alas, I don't Tumbl very well.</p>

      <p>APPLESAUCE </p>

<p>At farmer's market, ask the farmer for a half a peck or a peck of "mixed seconds for sauce". Use whatever apples they give you. In November 2014 I paid $7 for a peck of mixed seconds at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market.</p>

<p>Quarter and core many apples; do not peel. Cover bottom of pot with water, put in the apples, half (or a whole) orange (pref. organic, with seeds removed), one (or two) cinnamon sticks. Cook over gentle heat for at least 20 minutes, up to several hours, until apples break down. Cool. Remove cinnamon stick, scrape flesh from orange and return to pot; discard peel. Put apple mixture through food processor; grind well, so that no large pieces of peel remain.</p>

      <p>Symptoms include no audio inputs when a headset is plugged in, but the built-in mic works fine when the headset is not plugged in.</p>

<p><code>sudo killall coreaudiod</code> is one suggested fix.</p>

<p>This superuser.com article tells you how to <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/647396/reload-mac-audio-drivers-without-rebooting">reload Mac audio drivers without rebooting</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mohan Kartha for helping sort this out; still not convinced I can adequately fix it with these tools, or even that I have diagnosed the issue. Some of the discussion is about a "stuck optical switch".</p>

<p>Genius bar next.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Genius bar helpfully scheduled an appointment. The folks at the Apple store helpfully let me try other headsets and other mics and other computers, and the problem seemed to be isolated to my computer.</p>

<p>In the meantime I poked and poked and eventually landed on a description of the "Audio MIDI Setup" utility. I dutifully clicked through to it to see what was up, adjusted a few things, and then found this:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-29 at 11.13.41 AM" title="Screen Shot 2014-10-29 at 11.13.41 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Note that audio input is unhelpfully marked "mute". When I unmute, everything works fine. Why on earth this only shows up deep in the MIDI setup of all places I'm not sure; I know that I had fiddled around there before.</p>

      <p>I checked out a <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1459952">27 watt solar panel</a> with a very beefy battery from the Ann Arbor District Library. The battery also charges via a wall wart, and provides either 5V USB power or switchable 10V-19V DC. </p>

<p>I've been thinking about getting a solar panel, and my conclusion is that 27 watts is overkill for my normal use case which is powering my phone. The battery was awesome, but again overkill - too heavy to be an everyday carry.</p>

<p>My next checkout will be <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/14581720">this kit with a 7 watt panel</a> that looks more portable.</p>

<p>Power to the people!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The next major ancient Internet subsystem I'd like to get back is Usenet News. tin, trn, rn etc I all have a lot of muscle memory for, and by running netnews inside a closed network of other relatively trusted sites you have some hope of scaling the whole thing without needing to bust out into the swamp of the wild, wild Internet of netnews.</p>

<p>There's <a href="http://www.tin.org">tin</a>, ready to be compiled when you are. And it does compile on my MacBook, just with "brew install tin", so that's good. I signed up for <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org">eternal-september</a> to get an account that I can read netnews with. The eventual command line ends up being</p>

<pre>
tin -q -A -g news.eternal-september.org
</pre>

<p>Usenet appears to be a vast cesspool, but I think that's just a matter of not taking feeds from a lot of places and being ready to start new newsgroups that have limited distribution. I want to pick up on some of the de.* groups so I can brush up on my German again. Once upon I time I had an NNTP feed to fu-berlin.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Fun with source code control, so you don't lose any text. 
git and especially <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti">github</a> is
your friend.</p>

<p>Fun with server-side includes, learning about the Meta refresh hack,
and the XBitHack.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
to manage multiple shells on the same terminal. it
seems to work nicely under mosh. In the process of doing so I managed
to strand a bunch of mosh shells, which I'm going to clean up.</p>

<p><a href="http://tilde.club/~sippey">~sippey</a> is writing about 
time travel. We're at the permalinks stage
of weblog development, but I haven't sorted out just quite yet how to
make that work perfectly if/when I end up moving this date's post off
the front page. Or maybe I just type here indefinitely; or maybe I post
this also somewhere else, just to have a backup.</p>

<p>I'm logged in to tilde.club on my Android device using <a href="http://juicessh.com">JuiceSSH</a>. 
JuiceSSH has a nice keyboard for doing special characters, and it supports both
mosh and ssh for access.</p>

<p>I'm logged in to tilde.club using the <a href="http://mosh.mit.edu">mosh</a> shell, which
is said to be better as a laptop-to-the-cloud shell because it doesn't lose state
when you lose a network connection and re-establish elsewhere.</p>

<p>This design is based on my <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html">first weblog</a>, so it's kind of rough, and it
uses tables, and it's very, very plain. But I miss the weblogs of 1999
and am happy to be back at it. It's very nice to share a shell prompt
with the likes of 
<a href="http://tilde.club/~jessamyn">~jessamyn</a> and

      <p>I'm playing on <a href="http://tilde.club/~emv">tilde.club/~emv</a>.</p>

<p>It's interesting and fun to try to write a weblog when you don't have any content management system other than the Unix shell, but at some point quickly you end up moving a file on top of another file and wiping out a bunch of work, and then it gets less fun.</p>

<p>What I think I want to do there is write in Markdown, but somehow assemble bits of Markdown into what ends up looking like an old fashioned blog, with a sidebar that's interesting and ever-changing and a main blog part that's one post per day.</p>

<p>Tooling up to do that is proving interesting. How do you reliably convert markdown to HTML on the command line? It's not part of the standard Linux /usr/bin.</p>

<p>I'm also exercising "git" more these days.</p>

<p>Funtimes. And it's nice to be ~emv again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>RideScout is an app that provides info about a whole range of
transit options, including taxi, car share, bus, parking, and
more. They have support for Ann Arbor as a city, so I tried it
while riding AAATA (The Ride).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ridescoutapp.com/">http://www.ridescoutapp.com/</a></p>

<p>It's the first independent app that I've seen that shows where
every AAATA stop is, in a nice little app that works on your phone
with a zippy little map that scrolls nicely. That's great.</p>

<p>RideScout has bus arrival and departure information for schedules,
but it doesn't have real-time bus location info. So it thought that
I had made it to N Campus when really I was still waiting on the bus at
BTC. It could also have real-time parking info in Ann Arbor from
the Ann Arbor DDA, but it also doesn't. I didn't see the Arborbike
system in there either though that's pretty new.</p>

<p>The company behind RideScout has been bought by Car2Go, a car-sharing
service. <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/texas/2014/09/03/austins-ridescout-bought-by-daimler-car-rental-service-car2go/">Xconomy</a> has the story. Since Car2Go doesn't
have operations in Ann Arbor, I don't know what to expect of their
continued development here, but I like the idea!</p>

<p>"brew install lynx" gets a Lynx client on my Mac, and then you point lynx at gopher://gopher.floodgap.com and you're good to go.</p>

<p>"ssh new@sdf.org" and you can set yourself up a shell account with a gopher client installed and gopher server space available.</p>
