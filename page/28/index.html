<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.</p>
<p>I'm going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me.</p>
<p>1. Gmail is getting a new user interface, one that adds tabs and more integration with Google+. (<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">Gmail Blog</a>) "I know we feel the need to comment on everything right away these days, but honestly there isn't much to say about this feature until we've actually used it." (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787063">223 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. "The Drupal.org Security Team and Infrastructure Team has discovered unauthorized access to account information on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org." Users are advised to change their password, not to reuse passwords between sites, and to turn on two-factor authentication. 
(<a href="https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate">drupal.org</a>) 
"Malicious files were placed on association.drupal.org servers via a third-party application used by that site." - and commenters are wondering which third-party app was involved. 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788909">7 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. For $100/node/month, Linode announces a managed IT infrastructure. 
(<a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/05/29/introducing-linode-managed/">Linode</a>) 
"If the remote hands are awesome, this is well worth $100 per node. If they are anything but awesome, this wouldn't be worth it for any amount of money." 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788576">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>4. "The Magazine" has been sold by founder Marco Arment to editor Glenn Fleishman.
(<a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/29/sold-the-magazine">Marco Arment</a>)
Instapaper. Tumblr. and now The Magazine. Sounds like Marco is clearing house a bit.
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787079">57 comments</a>)</p>
<p>5. How to negotiate a job offer. "If you’re not currently working, and you don’t have competing offers, you’re pretty much out of luck."
(<a href="http://blog.upstart.com/2013/05/how-to-negotiate-job-offer.html">Upstart</a>)
"The "Pre-Reqs" piece is not right. You really don't need to have another job offer or a current job to negotiate. "
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787759">44 comments</a>)</p>
<p>6. Bill Gates is going to India because it has the grand challenge of extreme poverty and also the resources to attack that problem. He's also going to pick up some dance moves from a Bollywood star.
(<a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Topics/Development/Why-Im-Going-to-India">The Gates Notes</a>)
"Have you seen real poverty? Just take a trip to Mumbai and visit the slums there."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788874">25 comments</a>)</p>
<p>7. Amazon announces "Login with Amazon" as a single sign-on function for web sites.
(<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1824961&highlight=">Amazon PR</a>)
"I think this is a great idea. I don't love the Facebook OAuth flow and the amount of access most apps ask for."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5786554">69 comments</a>)</p>
<p>8. Mary Meeker's Internet Trends. 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5786828">17 comments</a>)

      <p><p>A late evening version of Hacker News for Tuesday 28 May 2013. I&#39;ve added links to the comments for each entry, and try to pull out a useful quote from the comments if there are any that are easy to find. Of interest: Pixar raytracing, Liberty Reserve money laundering, and Harvard email snooping.</p>
<p>1. A breakdown of github pull requests by acceptance rate, for a variety of languages and projects. If you want to get your pull request accepted, don&#39;t write C++, write Scala; and contribute to projects like Akka&#0160;and&#0160;backbone-fundamentals that take 80+% of pull requests. (<a href="http://paulmillr.com/posts/github-pull-request-stats/" target="_self">Paul Miller</a>)&#0160;&quot;<span style="color: #000000;">I&#39;m surprised the acceptance rate is so high.&quot;</span> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5783616" target="_self">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. &quot;Pixar&#39;s lighting/rendering systems were completely redone for their new film&#0160;<em>Monsters University.&quot; </em>Correspondence with Chris Horne, who worked on MU. &quot;So our Director of Photography went to a studio that is so clearly raytracing averse and essentially said &quot;We&#39;re raytracing everything.&quot; (<a href="http://thisanimatedlife.blogspot.com/2013/05/pixars-chris-horne-sheds-new-light-on.html?m=1" target="_self">Mason Smith</a>) (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5781904" target="_self">92 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. &quot;Liberty Reserve, which was incorporated in 2006, was a &quot;bank of choice for the criminal underworld,&quot; according to the indictment, which said the operation allegedly laundered the money through 55 million transactions before it was shut down earlier this month.&quot; $6 billion was allegedly laundered. (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323855804578511121238052256.html" target="_self">Wall Street Journal</a>) The comments note the precarious legal position of various Bitcoin exchanges.

      </h3>
      <p>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini. This comes together in a hurry - you can cook the whole thing up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Two or three cloves of garlic</li>
<li>Asparagus, about a pound</li>
<li>Button mushrooms, about a pound</li>
<li>Basil, dried or fresh</li>
<li>White wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<p>Boil water for pasta. When it&#39;s hot, cook the pasta. There should be time to drain it after you&#39;ve done the cooking of the asparagus.</p>
<p>Wash the asparagus, snap the tough ends, and slice on the bias into 1.5&quot; pieces. Clean the mushrooms and cut each one in half.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large frying pan on high. Fry the garlic until it&#39;s light brown and smells great.</p>
<p>Add the asparagus to the frying pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the asparagus is bright green. Add the mushrooms and keep stirring. When the mushrooms are hot, add the white wine, stir, and cover.</p>
<p>The recipe called for basil, but I didn&#39;t put it in because I was hurrying to get everything together.</p>
<p>The wine will deglaze the pan and make a nice sauce. Serve with pasta and white wine.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-28-kale-with-corn-and-green-onions/">Recipe: Kale with corn and green onions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>oil for frying</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>1 bag kale</li>
<li>corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better</li>
<li>green onions - chopped</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Wash and spin-dry the kale, being careful to get dirt out of the center rib. We had a very nice bag of small kale from market that didn&#39;t require much more than this, but if you have older, tougher kales, trim them of their tough bits and cut them into pieces.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large pot on medium high to high. Chop some garlic into big pieces. Fry the garlic until light brown and it smells good.</p>
<p>Add the kale and cook, stirring frequently, until the kale has cooked down to a fraction of its original size. Add some corn and the chopped green onions; stir. Cook until the corn is warmed through, then add some soy sauce and cover and turn down the heat to low.</p>
<p>One bag of kale served the family, with one person not eating it; there were a few leftovers. This recipe would multiply quite nicely.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">Yesterbox: answer yesterday&#39;s email, today</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://yesterbox.com" target="_self">Yesterbox</a> is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. In contrast, &quot;yesterbox&quot; gives you a finite number of messages to work through from yesterday, and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. There&#39;s no need to feel guilty, no need to feel like you&#39;re procrastinating, and no need to obsessively check today&#39;s messages. They can all be dealt with tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hseih estimates that it takes him three hours to plow through a day&#39;s messages, and he puts that time on his calendar in the morning to handle the previous day&#39;s correspondence. That&#39;s the world of a busy and successful CEO - you might well have a different time chunk that you&#39;d need to commit to, probably a lot less.</p>
<p>Emptying the inbox is a Sisyphean task. Yesterbox tries to make it a finite problem to handle. As a bonus, every conversation becomes a slow conversation, and there&#39;s a lot of routine unimportant detail in everyone&#39;s inbox that can be ignored once a day has gone past.</p>

I wonder how long it would take to process a day&#39;s worth of Twitter sent to you on one-day delay. In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was condemned to empty his email inbox each day, only to find it full the next day. &#0160;See Doug Mann,&#0160;<a href="http://www.adjunctnation.com/2006/09/01/54-the-electronic-myth-of-sisyphus/" target="_self">The Electronic Myth of Sisyphus</a>, 2006.)</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-on-summarization/">On summarization</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.</p>
<p>Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough. You might have to stitch together bits of several sentences to get one that describes the whole thing.</p>
<p>Summarization is active reading, and it improves recall. There&#39;s nothing quite like looking through a piece of text for its inner core to give you a real sense for what it&#39;s all about, and if you have to synthesize something new you recall that better than if you just hit the &quot;like&quot; button.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m skeptical of automated summarization, mostly because there seem to be enough people in the world interested in doing it by hand to make machine-aided cognition superfluous at least for popular articles. Machine reading works I suppose if you have so few eyes on the text that you have to crunch on it to make sense of it, but if there&#39;s an internet crowd to do that work the machine can simply tally human efforts instead of doing complicated automated text processing.</p>
<p>Hacker News is a challenging news stream to summarize because it turns over so quickly. In 12 hours or less, the top of the front page is fully new, and it&#39;s time to summarize again. I&#39;ve been doing it daily rather than 2x daily because the yield of interestingness just isn&#39;t there to call for more. There are other tech newsfeeds and newswires that are worth digesting, but not all of them are sufficiently different from Hacker News to provide a divergent task. For example, the top &quot;popular&quot; links on Pinboard overlap substantially with Hacker News, as does the front page of TechMeme.</p>
<p>Pinboard looks like it has the right kind of infrastructure to support summarization as a part of a workflow. The path would be to identify an interesting article, clip the good bit, hit &quot;pin&quot;, paste in the good bit, add a few tags, and save. To extract the useful stuff out you&#39;d run a report on the tag that you used that was unique to the category you were summarizing.</p>
<p>Summarization lends itself to pointless numbered bullshit (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2009/07/seven-things-i-want-to-remember-to-tell-you-about-blogging.html" target="_self">cf. #4 on this list</a>). Lots of articles are written with teaser headlines (5 best ways to do x) and can be unpacked by undoing the tease (The 5 best ways to do x are a, b, c, d, and e). You might take as your goal producing a summary that either dispenses with the need to read the original or that points the reader towards the best of what you have gone through and digested for them.</p>

      <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.</p>
<p>I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. A useful bit of code would monitor the site, send off a batch of 10 articles to be summarized, and then wait checking periodically until those 10 have all fallen from favor to send out a new batch of 10.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Jay Gatsby</strong>&#0160;is the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_role#Title_character" title="Title role">titular character</a>&#0160;of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>&#39;s 1925 novel&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>. The character has become an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">High society</a>&#0160;and the name has become synonymous with successful businessmen with shady pasts in the US.</p>
<h2>Character biography</h2>
<p>James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gatz, a bright young man from a poor family in North Dakota, despised the imprecations of poverty so much he dropped out of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Olaf_College" title="St. Olaf College">St. Olaf College</a>&#0160;in Minnesota after only a few weeks because of his shame at the janitorial job he had to take to pay his way. While training in 1917 to join the infantry and fight in&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>&#0160;he meets and promptly falls in love with the beautiful Daisy, who represents everything he is not: she is rich, from a patrician East Coast family and born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth. After the war, from which he emerged as a hero for his participation in the bloody battles of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Marne" title="Battle of the Marne">Marne</a>&#0160;and&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Argonne" title="Battle of Argonne">Argonne</a>, he attends&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford" title="Trinity College, Oxford">Trinity College</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>. While there he receives a letter from Daisy telling him she has married the equally aristocratic Tom Buchanan. Rather than admit defeat, he commits his life to becoming a man of the sort of wealth and stature he imagines could win her love.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gatz returned home to an America transformed by&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">prohibition</a>&#0160;in 1919, a period in American history in which gangsters earned the sort of vast wealth previously the domain of the connected upper classes, an era in which &quot;all the old boundaries that separated the classes were being broken, and a new wave of instant millionaires, like Gatsby himself&hellip; mingled with the polo-players who inhabited the stiff enclaves of the established rich of Long Island&#39;s gold coast.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&#0160;This era later came to be known as the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age" title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</a>, after Fitzgerald&#39;s own coinage.</p>
<p>Gatz, who renamed himself Jay Gatsby, made a fortune in bootlegging thanks to his association with gangsters like Meyer Wolfsheim (patterned after real-life American gangster&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rothstein" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a>) and sets himself up in a mansion in the fictional West Egg, Long Island, a haunt of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux_riche" title="Nouveaux riche">nouveaux riche</a>&#0160;and across from the old-line money East Egg, where Tom and Daisy Buchanan live. Gatsby hosts wild parties, open to all comers, there every weekend, in the hopes that Daisy will attend and he can win her heart. He eventually catches up with Daisy, but fails to convince her to leave Tom. After his failure to change Daisy&#39;s mind is clear to all but him, Daisy drives Gatsby&#39;s car with Gatsby in the passenger seat and she accidentally strikes and kills Myrtle, the lover of her husband Tom, in a hit-and-run accident. Myrtle&#39;s jealous husband George tracks the car back to the Buchanan home, where Tom lies and tells him that Gatsby was the driver of the car that killed his wife. George goes to Gatsby&#39;s house, finds him floating in his lavish pool, and murders him before taking his own life. Almost none of Gatsby&#39;s high society friends attend his funeral and in the meantime Gatsby&#39;s underworld connections begin picking through his belongings in his mansion.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Gatsby as a reference point</h2>
<p>The figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America.&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mathews" title="Chris Mathews">Chris Mathews</a>&#0160;in his book&#0160;<em>American</em>&#0160;even forgives Gatsby his serial lies. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy&#39;s, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because &quot;all my ancestors have been educated there&quot; Mathews sees him as the eternal American striver. &quot;Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had&#0160;<em>always</em>&#0160;had it&hellip; this blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy&#39;s specifications is the heart and soul of the&#0160;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>. It&#39;s the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>&quot;Jay Gatsby&hellip; appears to be the quintessential American male hero. He is a powerful businessman with shady connections, drives a glamorous car&hellip; and pursues the beautiful, privileged Daisy,&quot; Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson write.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;In the Handbook of American Folklore, Richard Dorson sees Gatsby as a new American archetype who made a decision to transform himself after his first chance encounter with his mentor Dan Cody, who opens the door to riches in boot-legging. &quot;The ragged youth who some months later (after Gatsby drops out of St. Olaf) introduces himself to a degenerate yachtsman as Jay Gatsby has explicitly rejected the Protestant ethic&hellip; in favor of a much more extravagant form of ambition.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Referring to real life figures as&#0160;<em>Gatsby</em>&#0160;has been common in the United States, usually in reference to rich men whose rise to prominence involved an element of deception. In a story on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Foster_Winans" title="R. Foster Winans">R. Foster Winans</a>, a reporter for the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>&#39;s&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column who was fired after it was discovered he was giving advance knowledge of the columns&#39; contents to Peter Brant, the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post_Intelligencer" title="Seattle Post Intelligencer">Seattle Post Intelligencer</a>&#0160;described Brant as &quot;Winan&#39;s Gatsby.&quot; The article noted that Brant had changed his name from Bornstein and said he was &quot;a man who turned his back on his heritage and his family because he felt that being recognized as Jewish would be a detriment to his career.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&#0160;The&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column often effects the prices of the stocks it mentions.</p>
<p>The character is often used as a symbol of great wealth.

      <p>An attempt to catch the top news of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_self">Hacker News</a> on a Friday evening and summarize the top 10 stories; I won&#39;t make any decisions about what should be in the top 10, just note them here with a summary. It took me about 30 minutes to summarize 10 stories, without being selective about which ones were important.</p>
<p>1. Ben Howdle is &quot;Too scared to write a line of code&quot; (<a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/eef96ea6f4cb?imm_mid=0a9102&amp;cmp=em-velocity-newsletters-vl-save20-20130523-direct" target="_self">Medium</a>). This reminds me of the Donald Knuth quote, &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;.</p>
<p>2. Yahoo has &quot;submitted a bid for the video site&quot; Hulu (<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130524/yet-another-hulu-bidder-yahoo-is-in-too/" target="_self">All Things D</a>). They&#39;re not the only ones bidding, with Directv, Time Warner Cable, and several others in the running.&#0160;</p>

<p>6. Plan 9 has some very tightly written, very strange C code; &quot;it’s not every day that you come across code that makes you feel funny because of its unusual syntactic structure&quot; (<a href="http://computationallyendowed.com/blog/2012/12/03/ifs-and-ands-and-plan-9s-source-code.html" rel="author" target="_self">Spiros Eliopoulos</a>).

<p>The I-5 Skagit River Bridge is a through-truss bridge that was built in 1955, according to the website Bridgehunter.com. It is the same basic type of design of the Interstate 5 Bridge over the Columbia River in Vancouver, according to the site.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>That&#39;s the word <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/05/23/fifth-washington-9/">from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/may-2013-peony-bloom-countdown-the-peony-garden-nichols-arboretum-ann-arbor.html">the peonies start</a> but before <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/strawberry-season-is-coming-for-2013-some-first-harvest-estimates.html">the u-pick strawberries are ready</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-22-introduction-to-bitcoin-notes-from-the-michigan-bitcoin-meetup-of-52213/">Introduction to Bitcoin: notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of 5/22/13</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Here are some notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of May 22, 2013. They are in no way reflective of everything that was discussed at the meeting; indeed, there&#39;s some things here that we didn&#39;t talk about at the meeting that I discovered later. But here goes anyway.</p>
<p>1. How does Bitcoin work? I&#39;m looking at the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it" target="_self">Khan Academy series on Bitcoin</a> and listened to one lecture which seems to spell it out quite well. I don&#39;t claim to know enough to describe the cryptographic ins and out here.</p>
<p>2. What can you do with Bitcoin? First, you can mine for new Bitcoins; that&#39;s popular, either with GPU-based mining tools or FPGAs or other specialized hardware (this <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison" target="_self">mining hardware comparison</a> is useful). Second, you can use Bitcoin to purchase goods and services, and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/05/09/25-things-i-learned-about-bitcoin-from-living-on-it-for-a-week/" target="_self">this Forbes reporter&#39;s account on living on Bitcoin for a week</a> is entertaining for a variety of reasons. Third, you can speculate in Bitcoin, hoping to buy low and sell high. Finally, you can build software and systems that help people do all of the above.</p>
<p>3. What are the risks of Bitcoin? First and foremost among those building software and systems, the problem is uncertainty of regulations, especially dealing with money laundering and financial crimes rules. The recent document &quot;<a href="http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html" target="_self">Application of FinCEN&#39;s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies</a>&quot; from March 2013 will need to be studied and pondered by everyone involved. The Washington Post (among many others) <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-15/business/39274717_1_money-laundering-monetary-policy-currency" target="_self">reported on Mt. Gox&#39;s troubles with FinCEN</a> and the seizure of funds from their account. There are also technical hurdles, such as the vulnerability of exchanges to denial of service attacks and the recent wild fluctuations in Bitcoin exchange rates.</p>
<p>4. How is this different from other virtual currencies? (I&#39;m thinking now Beenz, Flooz, Linden Dollars, Cybercash, Digicash, and the like.) See US News &quot;<a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/6-virtual-currencies-that-went-bust" target="_self">Six virtual currencies that went bust</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>5. Where is the action? In Ann Arbor, there&#39;s a startup exchange <a href="https://bitbox.mx/" target="_self">Bitbox</a>. In Berlin, there&#39;s the Kreuzberg district, with shops that accept Bitcoin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/26/bitcoins-gain-currency-in-berlin" target="_self">so says the Guardian</a>). The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-blY0Gv3o" target="_self">Winkelvoss twins</a> are in on the business. San Jose was the home of the conference <a href="http://www.bitcoin2013.com/" target="_self">Bitcoin 2013</a>. Things are hopping all over the world.</p>
<p>6. Bitcoin is too mainstream, where can I go for more experimental moneys? Try <a href="http://junkcoin.org/" target="_self">JunkCoin</a>, which puts an element of randomness into mining, or <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_self">Ripple</a>, the &quot;world&#39;s first open payment network&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not really a summary of the meeting, but it&#39;s a summary of the things that I didn&#39;t know before that I now know a bit(coin) better.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a few sources for recipes that are similar to what you get at Sweetwaters when you order a Ginger-Lemon Tea (one of my favorites).</p>
<p>From Coppertop Kitchen (a blog by someone who was a Sweetwaters barista): <a href="http://coppertopkitchen.blogspot.com/2012/01/ginger-lemon-tea.html" target="_self">Ginger Lemon Tea</a></p>
<blockquote>2 cups fresh lemon juice<br />1 3- by 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and sliced thinly<br />10 cups water<br />1 cup honey<br /><br />Place lemon juice, ginger, and water in a large saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil.&#0160; Boil for a couple of minutes, cover and remove from heat, and steep at least 30 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>From Food Network, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/lemon-ginger-tea-recipe/index.html?oc=linkback" target="_self">Lemon Ginger Tea</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 quart water<br />Juice of 1 lemon<br />1/4 cup freshly grated ginger<br />1/4 cup honey<br />Thin slices of lemon and lime for garnish</p>
<p>In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add lemon juice, the squeezed lemon, and ginger. Let steep about 20 minutes. Stir in honey. Line a strainer with a thin wet cloth and strain tea into a pitcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From The Ginger People&#39;s <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs087/1101564793691/archive/1102619855670.html" target="_self">newsletter</a>, writing about Sweetwaters:</p>
<blockquote>They initially juiced their own ginger for the Ginger Lemon Tea but its increasing popularity eventually caused them to look for a commercially available ginger ingredient. After considering several options, they decided on The Ginger People&#39;s ginger juice because of its high quality and intensely true ginger flavor. Their secret recipe, which now includes our ginger juice, is served either hot or cold, and is one of their top selling drinks.</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, the secret ingredient - you&#39;ll have to <a href="http://gingerpeople.com/ingredients" target="_self">buy it in industrial quantities</a>, or juice your own.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Credit to Salon&#39;s Andrew Leonard for the article &quot;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/17/revenge_ego_and_the_corruption_of_wikipedia/" target="_self">Revenge, ego, and the corruption of Wikipedia</a>&quot;, which unmasks wiki-troll Qworty and his pattern of anonymous mean-spirited edits to settle old grudges. Qworty - his real name is not important to my discussion of him - was a prolific Wikipedian. He routinely sabotaged the biographies of rival writers by doing things like removing lists of literary prizes they had won after they had died. Because Qworty generally played within the rules of the Wikipedia game, even his most egregious efforts had their defenders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/opinion/sunday/wikipedias-sexism-toward-female-novelists.html?_r=0" target="_self">the Filipacchi episode</a>, Qworty did not lack for defenders. Qworty, like many other Wikipedia editors, took seriously his responsibility to root out what he considered self promotion,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Peacock">unjustifiable praise</a>&#0160;or outright&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Puffery">puffery.</a>&#0160;Just the facts, ma’am! He described himself,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Qworty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=552532243">on his own Wikipedia user page,</a>&#0160;as particularly focused on identifying and fixing “articles with potential conflicts of interest.” Wherever he found people manipulating Wikipedia to their own advantage, he would intervene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Leonard caught wind of Qworty&#39;s excesses and decided to investigate further. What he found led to a remarkable revelation: Qworty was playing a game with Wikipedia, a game different from that of neutral points of view and building the knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Qworty&#39;s user page has been blanked, but thanks to Wikipedia&#39;s infinite memory, it lives on in past revisions. Before the page was shut down, it was replaced by a &#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qworty&amp;oldid=556021296" target="_self">postmodernist manifesto</a> of sorts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you ask “Who is Qworty?” be aware of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_fallacy" title="Affective fallacy">affective fallacy</a>&#0160;and the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy" title="Intentional fallacy">intentional fallacy</a>. Be aware that not everybody has reacted to my words in the way that you do (because not everybody is like you), and be aware that anybody who is trying to guess my intentions as a writer is blowing the purest gas.</p>
<p>So who is Qworty? Qworty is one of the creators of text on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And what is Wikipedia? Wikipedia is the great postmodern novel, the book that&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>&#0160;might have written if he had lived long enough and could somehow convert himself into the finite number of monkeys who are writing this postmodern novel that is subtitled “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia is pretty busy telling you what it is not—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>—so the question must be engaged, just what&#0160;<em>is</em>&#0160;Wikipedia, besides a poorly understood post-modern novel in perpetual progress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The postmodern encyclopedia does not like being described as such, and Qworty (after some thrashing about) has been banned from Wikipedia.</p>
