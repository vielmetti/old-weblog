<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>People in Urbana Illinois are up in arms that the Urbana Free Library director decided to discard a large portion of the library&#39;s non fiction collection. Shelves were left bare after books older than 10 years old were summarily discarded. Citizens, up in arms after their library collection was decimated, <a href="http://smilepolitely.com/culture/public_officials_do_not_have_the_luxury_of_lying/" target="_self">packed</a> a library board meeting to demand answers.</p>
<p>Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true. The last is most critical for nonfiction, where old works in science or medicine can be misleading or even dangerous.</p>
<p>Weeding is one of those arcane skills that is taught in library school. (Back off, man, I&#39;m a library scientist!) The problem happens when you don&#39;t pay attention to a wide range of factors when looking at what to get rid of.</p>
<p>My own bookshelves get sorted through from time to time, and I count on the library to backstop my collection when it&#39;s time to make room for new materials. It would be horrible to have that extra set of shelves full of books laid bare by an overzealous discard policy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been trying to keep up a daily pace to blogging here; that&#39;s been my habit for almost ten years. The problem is that it&#39;s not always easy to know what to write about.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day. E.g. on the 1st of the month be inspired by the letter &#39;A&#39; categories, on the 10th come up with something appropriate for &#39;J&#39;, and today the 23th come up with something to do with &#39;W&#39;. If you have enough categories, this actually isn&#39;t too hard; I have &quot;Weather&quot;, &quot;Web/Tech&quot;, &quot;Weblogs&quot;, &quot;Weird&quot;, &quot;Wiki&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, and &quot;Writing&quot; to choose from. X is much harder.</p>
<p>The same trick works to sort semi-randomly through your contact files, looking for the long-lost &quot;U&quot;-lettered friends on the 22d.</p>
<p>Equal attention by letters of the alphabet does not guarantee an equal balance of attention across all things; you&#39;d be better off somehow taking the old encyclopedic route of splitting C into Ca-Ch and Ci-Cz, and lumping W-X-Y-Z together.&#0160;</p>
<p>A little bit of deliberate randomness makes it appear as though you are more attentive to odd things than you might otherwise get if you just focused in on the simple things. Brainstorms that focus on something that are not for today&#39;s letter can be scheduled for posting into the future on the appropriate day-slot.&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself wishing that my contact manager would let me graph frequency of names across two dimensions, so that my name would be 5 across and 22 down, sorted together with all of the other E. V.&#39;s out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, just one more <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/great-weird-ideas" target="_self">great weird idea</a> to throw out into the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The original standards for the content of the RFC series, from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a> by Steve Crocker, 1969. Note that these are also good standards for blogging.
<blockquote>
<h3>CONTENT</h3>
<p>
The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to
the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged to
be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions without examples
or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques
without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions
without any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum length for
a NWG note is one sentence.
</p>
<p>
These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto
authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of
considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural
hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this
inhibition.</p>

      <p>Ever since upgrading my Mac to 10.6.8 I&#39;ve been running into memory problems, especially when I have a lot of Chrome windows open. I solved this problem - or I seem to have - by upgrading from 2G to 4G of memory, with memory from <a href="http://www.crucial.com/" target="_self">Crucial</a>. Less than $100 spent, and the computer no longer starts to thrash when I have more than a few windows open.</p>
<p>Now of course it&#39;s time to keep a lot more apps open to see what the new system limits are.</p>

      <p>Flooding of the Bow and Elbow Rivers inundated downtown Calgary, Alberta on June 21, 2013. Flooding and flash flooding has affected large parts of southern Alberta, due in part to a slow-moving storm front that is dumping a lot of rain on the area, up to 7.5 inches in 2.5 days. Three people have died from the flooding.</p>

At the moment I&#39;m&#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!</p>
<p>The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.</p>
<p>Using his own cutting-edge research as a professor at Wharton Business School, Adam Grant shows how helping others can lead to greater personal success. He demonstrates how smart givers avoid becoming doormats, and why this kind of success has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organisations and communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m particularly intrigued by the notion that there&#39;s a distinction that creates &quot;smart givers&quot; that win some unspecified game through a generous strategy that pays off for them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/06/15/council-mulls-speaking-rule-changes/" target="_self">As reported in the Ann Arbor Chronicle:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn. The two councilmember speaking turns per question are proposed to be reduced from five to three minutes, and from three to two minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The revisions will be considered by the full council at its June 17 meeting, as agenda item&#0160;<a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1446404&amp;GUID=55CB03CF-7941-4008-B527-110AD78F2BC2&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">13-0767</a>. [<a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Council-Rules-2013-draft-changes.pdf">.pdf of marked up rules for June 17, 2013 council meeting</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two obvious reasons why this might come up on the council rules agenda. One the presence of an individual (<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Thomas_Partridge" target="_self">Tom Partridge</a>) who generally uses every single public comment time available to him to speak his piece; in a single meeting, Partridge might account for 20+ minutes of public comment time. A second reason is the very effective &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Citizens_filibuster" target="_self">citizens filibuster</a>&quot; that several organized opposition groups have used to talk Council into the wee hours of the morning during public hearings. A well-organized group can bring forty or fifty people to the dais, accounting for two hours plus of a public hearing.</p>
<p>Reducing public comment time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes will slow down the frequent commenter, and additional rules to restrict individuals from commenting at successive sessions will further cut into their time and leave room for others to speak. Capping citizens participation time to 2 minutes during public hearings is less likely to have an impact on total meeting times, however. A group that&#39;s capable of corralling 45 citizens to speak out will just have to get 68 in front of the cameras to make the same point. Never underestimate the number of issues where the irate citizenry will work as hard as they can to make an impact on their elected decisionmakers.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is my 3000th post to my Typepad blog, of which about 2800 have been published. The collection spans almost 10 years, which means that I&#39;ve been keeping up on average about a post every weekday for a decade. (wow.)</p>
<p>If I repeat myself every once in a while, you&#39;ll excuse that, because repetition is the very soul of the net.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a fickle relationship with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems/" target="_self">reminder systems</a>. Usually the drill is to discover something new, vigorously dump everything I can possibly think into it, and then slowly but surely get disillusioned with it as time goes on. The smell of a new system is seductive, and when something new comes along there&#39;s a tendency to look at its good side and to focus on the bad parts of whatever you were using before.</p>
<p>Thus my latest desire is to stop using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">Github as an issue tracking system</a> for personal reminders, and to start using Evernote. I&#39;ve written about Github before; the truth of it is that it&#39;s not a bad system, but it&#39;s set up enough for multi-person use that some of the easy affordances of single person use go to the wayside. Besides, my own use of it has tapered off and that&#39;s a sign that something new needs to take its place.</p>
<p>Evernote hasn&#39;t been written about much here, but there&#39;s a lot that I am starting to like about it. The <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/06/06/evernote-reminders-arrive-on-android/?utm_source=vacuum" target="_self">Android</a> support for reminders is new. Android support in general it lags a bit behind iOS. The level that I&#39;m currently using it it&#39;s still free. Their reminder system is new, but still looks at least minimally functional enough to get the work done. Since it fits in my phone pretty well it seems as though I should be able to make the transition and not be pinned down in front of my computer screen when it&#39;s time to brainstorm what to do next.</p>
<p>Basically it&#39;s what every new system is, the new system smell, while it&#39;s still revolutionary and not the politburo. Enjoy the new system before you figure out how to routinize it into distraction.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-13-writing-up-a-fire-storm/">Writing up a (fire) storm</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Since yesterday, thousands of people have read <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/06/black-forest-fire-near-colorado-springs-colorado-with-map.html" target="_self">my brief account of the Black Forest Fire</a>. I tried to include enough maps that someone far away from the fire (like me) would find some context for it that made sense, and enough detailed links to more local reporting and official sources that someone nearby would be able to get to the resource that had more current and on-the-spot coverage than I could ever do.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written fire-related posts before, including one for the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/duck-lake-fire-north-of-newberry-mi.html" target="_self">Duck Lake Fire near Newberry, MI</a> last year. I make sure to get good detailed maps of that area, because there&#39;s a pattern that burned-over areas provide good morel mushroom hunting the year after and good blueberry picking grounds for years to come.</p>
<p>When fires hit near an urban area, there&#39;s an immediate influx of television and newspaper resources to help local residents keep themselves and their homes safe. Imagery from fires is dramatic. When it&#39;s time to put this information on a map, it&#39;s a real challenge in real-time cartography in an environment where you might not always know exact details.</p>
<p>Writing about fires is thus a way to simultaneously make sense of the news and participate in its creation. You try to not make matters worse by carefully time and date stamping your observations so that it doesn&#39;t become old news that recirculates as new. Twitter is helpful but oh so fragmented, and most of the people I know through that channel are far enough away from any given incident not to care very much. The traffic to my Black Forest Fire page came in overwhelmingly from search, and the most common search term was &quot;black forest fire map&quot; - exactly the first thing that I was looking for when I heard about it. If you can answer &quot;where is this thing happening&quot;, &quot;do I know anyone nearby&quot;, and &quot;who knows more about it than I do&quot;, you can get to a point where your combination of links becomes a resource.</p>

<p>The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog. Lots of photos and news are showing up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackForestFire&src=hash">#blackforestfire</a> Twitter tag. Residents can call 719-444-8300 for information on the fire, but no exact information is available on individual homes yet. Official info from <a href="http://www.elpasoco.com/Pages/default.aspx">El Paso County</a> will be <em>more current than this page</em>.</p>

<p>The data, which matches up to the screen shot below:</p>
<p>1. What days and times you were mentioned in the Twitter stream, broken into 6 hr intervals.</p>
<p>2. When people followed and unfollowed you, also in 6 hour timeline intervals.</p>
<p>3. Your &quot;best&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;all&quot; tweets, where best and good tweets have more favorites, retweets, or replies.</p>
<p>4. How many people clicked through on any link you have posted to Twitter.</p>
<p>5. Which of your tweets have been retweeted enough times to give you increased reach for those ones.</p>

It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). When you go back to reread what&#39;s been written down, some part of the memories come back. If you&#39;re lucky and captured some particularly salient point, the entire memory - the entire conversation - can return and you&#39;ll be transported back to another time and place.</p>
<p>A weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something that&#39;s not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you again. You&#39;d really rather never have to go through the ordeal again but just in case someone else happens on it you&#39;ll have that capsule of hard-won knowlege written down. You&#39;ll write it down so that you can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you&#39;ll relearn it as from new based on your old notes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating them with new information or with recollections that match the time. Every so often I&#39;ll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn&#39;t want to be something that I want to remember and that isn&#39;t forgotten yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don&#39;t want to be remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that I can&#39;t easily bring myself to completely deleting.</p>
<p>Some blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).</p>
