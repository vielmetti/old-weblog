I am not certain how else this meeting was promoted; there&#39;s no sign of this on the city&#39;s &quot;News&quot; page, nor does a full text search of the City web site turn up a copy of it elsewhere. It affects everyone who goes to U of Michigan football games.
The Ann Arbor dotcom had previously reported on the same plans when they surfaced in 2010, and provides a few more details in their 2013 story. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-16-public-meeting-to-discuss-the-closure-of-main-street-for-football-games-july-24-2013-600-pm-ann-arbo/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -
 These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;perceived&#0160;as two different cities.
 The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-15-when-i-hear-a2council-talking-about-the-city-and-the-university-i-think-about-china-mievilles-the-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Polls are fun ways to get people&#39;s opinions, and the All Our Ideas website is a particularly good form of this polling because it lets readers add their own suggestions.
As an introduction to this, here&#39;s a simple poll: what are good ways that you suggest to meet new people? You&#39;ll get a choice of two from the list to pick which one is better, and if you have a better idea you can add it in. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-09-good-ways-to-meet-new-people-take-our-poll/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This blog has had a burst of traffic (hi Boing Boing readers) and as a part of that traffic I&rsquo;m seeing hits coming from news readers. Google Reader had been the dominant RSS reader for a long time, and its demise has given an opportunity for others to gain some currency.
Feedly seems to be the winner so far, with the bulk of the feed-reading traffic to this site coming from there. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-09-which-feed-readers-are-winning-post-google-reader/">&raquo;</a></p>

Some of the best brief accounts are on Twitter, using the various hashtags #TOflood, #floodTO, #TOstorm, #stormTO, and #darkTO.

 The 10,000 lb. gorilla of birthdays is Facebook, which offers a nice simple interface to send a one-line birthday greeting.

            <p>The&#0160;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is a secretive organization, but it does have a web site. Now Eric Mill (@konklone) is tracking that site&#39;s every change.
His first writeup of it describes version one of a tracking system:
 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, responsible for overseeing the US government&#39;s foreign surveillance activities via FISA, actually does have a&#0160;public website. They seem to have just created it, as it doesn&#39;t have any documents from before June of 2013, and the Wayback Machine&#0160;has no record of it&#0160;prior to that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-07-watch-the-actions-of-the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court-with-fisacourt/">&raquo;</a></p>

As of this writing (1:19 PM PT) there are no confirmed fatalities, but it&#39;s too early yet to give a final accounting. The plane did not report any problems before landing, and caught fire on the ground.
SFO airport was closed for several hours, and flights were diverted to other area airports. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-06-asiana-airlines-flight-214-a-boeing-777-crash-lands-at-san-francisco-airport-with-303-on-board/">&raquo;</a></p>

Lots of candy, lots of politicians, lots of kids on bikes.

 Douglas C.
