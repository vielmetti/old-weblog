      <p>Here&#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow.</p><p>1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy.</p><p>2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary.&#0160; In any case, write around the start of your post.</p><p>3.&#0160; Go into your favorite blog editing tool and write enough in the input box for your post so that you fill it completely.&#0160; You aren&#39;t constrained by 140 characters there, but there&#39;s still some reasonable limit, and you don&#39;t want to go over.</p><p>Blogging is good for when you have more to say; twitter helps you say it in less words.&#0160; Use both.</p>

      Bumboats are small boats used as floating shops that market to sailors in harbor.&nbsp; There's a tradition of them on the Great Lakes; here's what I could find with a bit of searching.<br><br>In Duluth, Minnesota, <a href="http://www.duluthport.com/99wintspr/marinetrader.html">the Marine Trader went back to the lakes in 1998</a>:&nbsp; (via a story in Minnesota's World Port w/photos)<br><span  style="font-family: Arial" size="3;"><br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">On May 24, 1998, an
 old boat and an even older maritime practice both came back to life. Here’s what
 happened, as described by Franz VonRiedel: "After 12 years of lying idle, the
 bumboat Marine Trader pulled up along-side the 650-foot self-unloader Algoway at the
 Cutler-Magner salt dock in Duluth. Up went the ladders, and the crew members of the
 Algoway scrambled down to do a little shopping … " </font></div>
 
 <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Franz VonRiedel wrote those words as part of an
 article for a recent edition of the Nor’easter, the journal of the Lake Superior
 Marine Museum Association. Mr. VonRiedel knows bumboats, and he really knows the Marine

      </h3>
      <p>I put up a little project on github last night, <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter mutual friends</a>.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.</p><p>I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</p><p>The existing Twitter feedback for these is very limited, based almost entirely on numerical counts.&#0160; I thought I could do better by examining what kind of mutual relationships already existed between me and other people and to see if I could characterize folks based on who else they followed to know at least which part of my life they might have found me by.</p><p>Thus, the twitter mutual friends effort.&#0160; The simplest version of this downloads two friend lists, and looks for overlap.&#0160; The list of overlapping ids is walked through, noting who the overlapping people are, what their last twitter was, how many people they in turn were following, and the like.&#0160; </p><p>You could look either at friends, followers, or mutual friend/follow pairs; you can derive things from the text of recent tweets from mutual friends, or their follow counts, or other second derivatives of mutuality or reciprocity.&#0160; At some point there&#39;s a nice visual of all of this, as well as some good textual analysis (&quot;trending words in our mutual followers&quot;).&#0160; But as a start this is just an effort to get beyond simple counting and into network views of twitter.</p>

<p>According to a report in The Michigan Citizen, the court earlier granted in part the prosecutor’s request to “preclude argument, the asking of questions, and the introduction of any other evidence purporting to show that defendant was acting in her capacity as a reporter during the events in question,” and “rul[ed] essentially that only Bukowski could testify regarding her role as a reporter.”</div><br />

are doing, their coverage could be much, much better if they paid
respect to those listening and watching online, which includes their
smart phones. What they need are plain hard facts, rather than the
vague, boiled-down or sensationalized stuff that was News As Usual for
the duration.</p><p>Take home point #3 is all you need:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Uncomplicate your damn websites</strong>. Without
exception, legacy media have websites that are far too complicated and
jam-packed with visual noise, including promotions of junk that is
highly uninteresting to visitors looking for hard facts about their
homes and neighborhoods.</p><p>There&#39;s much more news and many more photos than I can possibly link to here.&#0160; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=jesusita">On Twitter search for #jesusita</a> or #jesusitafire for lots of information.&#0160; <a href="http://timhatch.com/panos/jesusita-fire">Tim Hatch has some panoramic photos of the fire</a>.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sundowner-stress8-2009may08,0,7680616.story">LA Times always has good wildfire coverage</a>, not the great coverage that Doc wants for his neighbors, but something to put things in perspective from miles away.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Let me explain to you why those terms don&#39;t explain things very well.</p><p>I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers.</p><p>Public accounting at the turn of the century was hard work.&#0160; Not only did you have to come to some means of doing standard categorization for hundreds or thousands of categories of events and expenditures in a typical rail operation, but you also had to manage all that data flowing back to you as print and then reconstruct it into numbers.&#0160; And then you had to make the case that one type of patented equipment was much more dangerous than another and that some private enterprise needed to be coerced, encouraged, or jawboned into making investments in public safety.</p><p>You would think that 100 plus years later, with all of our wonderful technology, that things would be better.&#0160; You&#39;d be wrong.&#0160; Government organizations and publicly regulated institutions are still primarily putting together products designed to be printed, and in most cases there is very little thought put towards the use or reuse of the data hiding inside.&#0160; </p><p>In one extreme, this shows up as hundred plus page long PDFs of scanned in images presented to board members to help them make decisions, including scanned in spreadsheets that have numerical errors that cannot be audited without rekeying.&#0160; In another extreme, it means that no two public organizations that report the number of flu cases have precisely the same number, since their reporting cycles are different and no one is adding things up except at document preparation and print time.&#0160; </p><p>You can&#39;t count on critical public information being available in non-proprietary file formats, and you can&#39;t count on non-critical public information being made openly available to the public at all.</p><p>It&#39;s so bad that people trust Wikipedia more than they trust any other source, because at least with Wikipedia you know that what you&#39;re looking at might be wrong and there&#39;s a healthy dose of skepticism that can be dealt with by examining original documents.</p><p>So if I ask for that page of numbers as the spreadsheet it was originally, and a public records officer for a public body gives it to me as a bitmap, I&#39;m going to ask again and keep asking publicly and perhaps uncomfortably until we both understand that this is a routine request and that compliance with routine requests is much easier than making everything an exception - because maybe, just maybe, I can replace that FOIA letter with a tiny shell script and we can just go about our business.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve become one of those people who requests and then reads the &quot;board packets&quot; for meetings of public bodies.&#0160; These are fascinating things, generally 50-150 page tomes of memos, spreadsheets, graphs, charts, and news clippings that the staff of a public body will prepare for its board to go into a public meeting.</p><p>The fascinating thing from a technical point of view is just how many of these board packets include spreadsheets, and how many of the spreadsheets are presented either as bitmapped images or as text-only documents.&#0160; In either case, there&#39;s no way to know how the spreadsheet is constructed, whether the totals presented really add up to the totals displayed, and what if anything is hidden in the model used to come up with the numbers.</p><p>The latest one of these I&#39;m getting clarification on is a spreadsheet where the numbers simply don&#39;t add up - one row of expenses where the sum of the figures doesn&#39;t jive with the total presented.&#0160; And I can&#39;t look at that without thinking a lot more about what else I might be missing, either by accident or design.</p><p><a href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11779964?f=related">Not that anyone would deliberately hide things in a spreadsheet, though it&#39;s been known to happen in my little town:</a>&#0160; from CFO.COM:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The former CFO of a company that produces electronic databases of

at the familiar baseball dream through Dominican eyes. The Dominican
Republic has, in recent years, been Major League baseball’s mother
lode. And to the young Dominicans, of course, America is the mother
lode. Boys on the island dream of getting out and — just like Pedro
Martinez or Albert Pujols or “Big Papi” David Ortiz — making it to the
bigs and to its cathedral, Yankee Stadium. Or if not all the way, at
least far enough along baseball’s highway to afford a new home for mom.&#0160;</p><p><a href="http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=review&amp;id=2471&amp;reviewid=VE1117935902">Variety reviewed it during Sundance</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">

draws the curtain back on the seldom considered world of Dominican
baseball players trying to make it in the United States. Sympathetic,
genial and exceedingly wholesome, it&#39;s a film that, once seen, will
permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the
characters&#39; real-life counterparts. HBO Films offering will be well
received wherever it plays, notably in Latin America; expansion beyond
highly specialized situations in Stateside theatrical release would be
daunting. </p><p>Sugar was shot in Iowa, where the lead character Azucar settles to play single-A ball.&#0160; <a href="http://screenwritingfromiowa.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/sundance-sugar-and-the-strange-land-of-iowa/">From the Screenwriting from Iowa blog</a>:</p><p class="blockquote MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">The filmmakers of <span style="font-style: italic;">Suga</span>r
shot much of the film in Davenport, Iowa and the surrounding Quad
Cities and were one of the first to take advantage of recent tax
incentives for filmmakers who spend over $100,000 in the state.</p>
<p class="blockquote MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Earlier this month Iowa
Governor Chet Culver in speaking about Iowa’s commitment to helping
filmmakers said, “Iowa has a lot to offer the film industry and, quite
frankly, we want more movies filmed in our state. As a television or
motion picture producer with the greatest of expectations, in Iowa, you
can find it all. The new film tax credit and training award send a
clear signal to Hollywood: Iowa is camera-ready and open for business.” </p>
<p>Thanks to Debbie Sobeloff for the heads up about this, who liked it when she saw it in DC because it &quot;treated all of the characters with dignity&quot;.&#0160; I don&#39;t know of any local Ann Arbor show times (not that I ever get out to the movies....)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Laundry is a chore. I&#39;m only slowly getting better at it after most of
a year of having increasing responsibilities.
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Mama mama make me clean. Every day the same routine.&#0160;
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SWX2jBT6Cm0C">Jean Marzollo</a>)<br /></div><p><br />The most important part of doing laundry once you start it is to figure
out what the cycle time is that you need to keep up to make continuous
progress, and then work with that timing in mind as you plan your
effort. If your washing machine takes 45 minutes to run, then going
downstairs 30 minutes later is a wasted trip, and going down an hour
later slows down system throughput considerably.&#0160; No one yet that I know is using any web based time to change the laundry app that monitors your appliance directly, but simple timers or even just knowing that the top of the hour is when you go down to work on it should be enough.</p><p>Laundry works best when clothes and wash are sorted before they get
dumped into the washer. This suggests that every time you put in a load
you should immediately sort the next load, so that there&#39;s no need to
wait any more time that you need to the next time the cycle runs.
Sorting is made a lot easier by having big clearly labeled baskets. (I
never have figured out the symbols.)
</p><p>One school of laundry thought says to do a load every day; the other
says to do all the wash you have to do once a week in a continuous
stream. What is best for you depends on how many kids there are getting
clothes dirty, how many days or weeks of little boy clothing you have
in your stockpile so that there&#39;s always a dry pair of clean pants
during mud puddle season, and what kind of mindless work you can do
while folding. In any case, there&#39;s little to be gained from making
laundry a random process - routines repeated every week make it all
easier.
</p><p>It&#39;s 2:00pm; I promised myself that I&#39;d go to the basement every hour
on the hour and move the process forwards. If I work at this properly
it will take less than 15 minutes to get the next load in and then I&#39;ll
be able to have another 45 minutes of writing time.</p><p>More reading, should you need to, falls in two rather distinct camps: the domestic diva enthusiasm as seen on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#flylady">#flylady</a> , or the art and science of keeping home exemplified by <a href="http://google.com/search?q=cheryl+mendelson+home+comforts">Cheryl Mendelson&#39;s Home Comforts</a>.&#0160; Either way there&#39;s method in the madness, and I haven&#39;t even touched on the strategies of sending all of your wash out to be done, or taking it all to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Laundromats">laundromat</a> weekly for one big megawash. </p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor Chronicle reported that the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/04/27/a2-ann-arbor-gold-2/">Ann Arbor Gold gift certificates will be redeemed by the Chamber of Commerce:</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The Ann Arbor Area Chamber of Commerce now plans to use its own funds
to reimburse people who purchased Ann Arbor Gold certificates. Earlier
this year, the company that administers the program, CertifiChecks,
filed for bankruptcy.<br /></div><p><br />An April 15 story from the AP notes that <a href="http://www.newarkadvocate.com/article/20090415/NEWS01/904150314/1002/rss01">the bankruptcy filing has gone through in Dayton, OH (via the Newark Advocate):</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">CertifiChecks Inc., which abruptly closed in February, filed for
Chapter 7 Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
Ohio. CertifiChecks listed assets of $1 million in personal property
that included funds in savings and checking accounts in the filing. It
also listed liabilities of $460,000.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">A recorded message at the
court clerk&#39;s number for automated case information said a meeting of
the company&#39;s creditors was scheduled for June 10.</p><p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.speakoutohio.gov/speak-out/what-you-should-know-about-certifichecks-bankruptcy">what the Ohio Attorney General has to say about the matter</a>:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">On April 13, Dayton-based gift certificate company CertifiChecks,
Inc. filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy
Court Southern District of Ohio, Dayton Division.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">You must file your Proof of Claim with the bankruptcy court by
September 8, 2009.&#0160; Filing a Proof of Claim tells the court that you
are a “creditor” (which means that money may be due to you).&#0160; It also
helps to ensure that you will receive important updates about the
bankruptcy.&#0160; You can even fill out a <a href="http://www.ohsb.uscourts.gov/pdffiles/B10claimform1005.pdf" target="_blank">Proof of Claim form electronically</a>.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.speakoutohio.gov/wp-content/uploads/4-14-09-notice-of-chapter-7-bankruptcy-case-meeting-of-creditors-deadlines.pdf" target="_blank">Notice of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy – United States Bankruptcy Court</a></p><p>I&#39;ll assume that chambers of commerce who redeem their members gift certificates will take a loss, and that they will bundle up all of the certificates redeemed for the bankruptcy court; I have no idea how much of this &quot;money&quot; is recoverable, but Chapter 7 means the organization is liquidating not to return to business.</p>

but if you do so, make sure you read the Ann Arbor city ordinances and all of the very, very fine print very carefully:
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
No permit shall be issued to a person, by the City, and no chickens shall be allowed to be kept unless the owners of all residentially 
zoned adjacent properties (see 9:42(3)(j)) consent in writing to the permit. Please attach the Adjacent Neighbor Consent Form to 
this application and check the box that you understand and have complied with the terms of this ordinance requirement.  
 <br /></div><br /><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
If the requirements of Chapter 107 are not complied with, the City may revoke any permit granted and/or initiate prosecution for a 
civil infraction violation. A person who has been issued a permit shall submit it for examination upon demand by any police officer or 
code enforcement officer. Fenced enclosures are subject to all provisions of Chapter 104 (Fences). Notwithstanding the issuance of a 
permit by the City, private restrictions on the use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit. Private 
restrictions include but are not limited to deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws, 
and covenant deeds. A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens 
is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.repastspresentandfuture.org/123-people-eat-at-selma-cafe-and-king-of-calm-silvio-medoro-does-not-break-a-sweat/#respond">What happens if the man doesn&#39;t agree with your poultry easement</a>: you get a personal visit from the city attorney (!!!!!) who is apparently the city&#39;s only animal control officer.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We decided we were not interested in pursuing the official permit,
as we are a bit out of compliance anyway and do not really feel this
should be required (that this process is more just a way for the city
to ease into a common sense practice). The city attorney hand delivered
a notice telling us of all our waywardness. I will post a
notice/petition of support out front. Please come by and sign it when
you get a chance. Thanks!!</p><p>Read the <a href="http://www.chickenvideo.com/topten.html">Top Ten Reasons to Raise Your Own Yard Hens</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">

      <p>If the power goes out for an extended period of time, some of your food can go bad.&#0160; Here&#39;s pointers to documents you can grab ahead of time and print out so that you can know how to sort through things.</p><p>From the <a href="https://americanredcross.com/services/disaster/0,1082,0_564_,00.html">American Red Cross: Food safety in a power outage</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Sudden power outages can be frustrating and troublesome, especially
when they are prolonged. Perishable foods should not be held above 40
degrees for more than 2 hours. If a power outage is 2 hours or less,
you need not be concerned, but how do you save your food when the
refrigerator is out for longer times? Being prepared can help. By
planning ahead, you can save your perishables.</p><p>USDA, <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/keeping_food_Safe_during_an_emergency/index.asp">Keeping Food Safe During an Emergency</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible 
    to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food 
    safely cold for about 4 hours if it is unopened. A full freezer 
    will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if 
    it is half full) if the door remains closed. Obtain dry or block 
    ice to keep your refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is 
    going to be out for a prolonged period of time. Fifty pounds of 
    dry ice should hold an 18-cubic foot full freezer for 2 days. Plan 
    ahead and know where dry ice and block ice can be purchased. </p><p>CDC, <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/poweroutage/needtoknow.asp">What you need to know when the power goes out unexpectedly</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of your food right
before you cook or eat it. Throw away any food that has a temperature
of more than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. <br /></div><p><br />When the 2003 blackout hit, one of the things that I didn&#39;t know was that the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Busch%27s">Busch&#39;s</a> store nearest me had an emergency generator and was online the whole time.&#0160; Not every grocery store has uninterruptable power.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dry_ice">The Arborwiki dry ice page</a> has a listing of some companies in the Ann Arbor area that sell dry ice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year I look forward to finding pea greens, so that I can stir fry them up.&#0160; And every year at the farmer&#39;s market I don&#39;t find them.&#0160; I hope this year can be different, but I have some questions.</p><p>If I wanted to grow pea greens on my own, what variety of peas would I use?<br />Are pea vines usually sprayed, and would you want to look out for no-spray vendors?<br />When is the best time to pick?<br />Do you lose all of the pod harvest or can you have both?<br />If I harvested a bushel of vines from a U-Pick operation would they look at me funny?</p><p>Our traditional pea-picking weekend here is Father&#39;s Day, when we go to Rawsonville for peas and strawberries and we make sure to take sunblock and water (note to future self).</p>

computing-in-the-bad-weather, talking about rolling out VPNs to
peoples’ homes, how to protect the in-house network from home-borne
viruses, but web based CRM needs nothing so complex - just log in and
go! Sometimes life doesn’t need to be so complex.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://old.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/articles/papers/247.pdf">Dr. Richard Snow writes about fault tolerance in railway scheduling (PDF):</a></p><div class="snap_preview">

rates, measured by weighing snow blown into a filter fabric trap, were
greater over hard snow or ice than for the same wind speed over soft,
fresh snow surfaces. Analysis of wind speed profiles from nine
blizzards showed that friction between moving particles and the surface
was less, and particle speeds were greater over hard surfaces.
Transport rates at a given wind speed increased rapidly as aerodynamic
roughness decreased in the rough-smooth transition region. Bagnold&#39;s
theory for bed load transport provided a useful framework for the
analysis.</div><p><br />So, what we have includes modeling systems when there is inclement weather, modeling the transport of fine particles during inclement weather, and building simulators that are computer controlled to let you see how things work.&#0160; All fun ideas.</p><p><a href="http://www.pasty.com/heikki/heikkilunta.html">(More info at pasty.com)</a></p>

</p><div>&#0160;</div>

<div>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</div>
<div>3/4 cup milk </div>
<div>1/2 tsp salt</div>
<div>2 medium baking apples, peeled and thinly sliced&#0160; (I used Braeburn apples)</div>
<div>3 Tbs sugar</div>
<div>1/2 tsp ceylon cinnamon</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Preheat oven to 400.&#0160; divide butter between two 9&quot; pie plates and
put them in the oven to melt the butter.&#0160; Rotate to be sure that butter
covers bottom and&#0160; sides of pans.&#0160; Use a 4 cup measuring cup as a
mixing bowl (makes it easy to divide the batter).&#0160; Beat eggs, flour,
milk and salt on medium speed for 1 minute.&#0160; Divide the apple slices
between the pans and pour 1/2 of the egg mixture over each pan.&#0160; Mix
the cinnamin and sugar and sprinkle over the batter.&#0160; Bake until puffed
and folden brown&#0160; 20-25 minutes.&#0160; Serve right away, while still puffy,
with warm syrup.&#0160; </div>

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Serves 4-6&#0160;&#0160; Prep time 10 minutes, baking time&#0160; 20-25 minutes. <br /><br />and the report from up north from March 18, 2009:<br /></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Over the weekend we put 28 taps in our maple sugar trees.&#0160;&#0160; We
collected 8 gallons the first day but the next two nights were not
below freezing.&#0160; We have only 17 gallons so far.&#0160; It was cold last
night so the sap should run today.&#0160; Snowshoes are very necessary as the
<span class="il">snow</span> is &quot;punky&quot;.&#0160; Even with snowshoes we
sometimes break through the crust and one leg goes down 1 foot...makes
for slow going.&#0160; Hopefully we have a good wide track packed now.&#0160; </div>

It just rolled out April 1st. Our area associations, I imagine, are

THE STORY OF MAD-STONE<br />
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]<br />
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all<br />
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,<br />
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison.<br />
This stone has something of a history. In 1848 Captain Wilson, of<br />
Alabama, killed a white deer in Talladega County, and search was made<br />
in the stomach for a stone. One was found a little larger than a<br />
goose-egg, with a flat surface on one side It resembled a petrified<br />
sponge. The stone up to this time has been used in upward of one<br />
thousand cases. Captain Wilson gave the stone to Mr. Cowan, who lives<br />
near Handley, in this county. Mr. Cowan, as a token of great<br />
friendship, gave the stone to W. R. Sanner, who would part with it for<br />
no amount. The philosophy of the operation of the stone and the reason<br />
it is found in the stomach of the white deer is given by the Indians<br />
as follows: &quot;The white deer is more susceptible to vegetable poisons<br />
taken into the stomach when eaten with grass. To preserve the life of<br />
the animal, nature has placed in the stomach this porous stone, which<br />
at once absorbs the poison, neutralizes it, and saves the deer&#39;s life.<br />
The stone applied to a bit into which poison has been injected at once<br />
draws it out, and when its pores are filled drops off; being soaked in<br />
milk the stone is made pure again and ready for another application.&quot;</p>

Stephen Rapundalo, who&#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the
council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a
vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said.</p><p><a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/03/06/city-council-and-the-values-of-ann-arbor/">The Ann Arbor Chronicle gives many more details in its account of the council meeting:</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rapundalo moved for a postponement to June 1 to allow city staff to
have a little more time to take in information and to have a discussion
with retailers. Rapundalo asked Bryan Weinert, the solid-waste
coordinator for the city of Ann Arbor, to give an update on staff
efforts. Weinert said that on March 22-23 staff would be meeting with
retailers to get feedback on the already-drafted ordinance. He said
there would be information on city’s website and a public information
survey, acknowledging that there was some controversy surrounding the
issue.&#0160; Weinert said that based on feedback from the public and
merchants, staff would bring forward a recommendation. Weinert did not
state what the range of possibilities for such a recommendation would
be.</p><p>Plastic bag manufacturers are not immune to the current economic stress; <a href="http://hilexpoly.com/news/single/article/hilex-poly-announces-agreement-to-restructure-debt-15//nbp/170.html">one leading manufacturer, Hilex Poly, just went through Ch. 11 bankruptcy (restructuring of debt) in 2008.</a></p><p class="bodytext" style="margin-left: 40px;">HARTSVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA – May 6, 2008 – Hilex
Poly Co., LLC, (&quot;Hilex&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;), the world’s largest plastic
bag company, today announced that it has reached an agreement with its
lenders to restructure its senior secured debt. Hilex is taking this
action to significantly reduce its overall debt and strengthen its
balance sheet to better serve its customers and continue its market
leadership position in the plastic bag industry. In addition to a
substantial reduction in outstanding debt, the plan will reduce annual
interest expense and significantly improve cash flow. </p><p class="bodytext">Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutplasticbags.com/">Hilex Poly also publishes a web site called &quot;The Truth About Plastic Bags&quot;, </a>which is unvarnished pro-plastic bag propaganda; I won&#39;t quote from it, but if you want the plastics side of the story, here it is.&#0160; </p><p class="bodytext"><a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=7572">Dart Container of Mason, MI opposed the Palo Alto plastics ban</a> by astroturfing letters to city council there in 2008.&#0160; The Palo Alto Online News picked up the story:</p><p class="bodytext">

Thursday. He confirmed his company had sponsored the letter campaign, a
tactic it has used in other communities considering bans. </p>

<p class="story_text" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;The issues surrounding the ban are much more
nuanced and complicated than I think people realize and the stated
goals to be achieved by these bans are not going to be realized by
