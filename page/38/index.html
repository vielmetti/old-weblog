<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>As part of my search for work in Ann Arbor, I&#39;ve been compiling a list of employers who maintain lists of open opportunities on their web sites. You can see the list here</p>
<p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jobs" target="_self">http://arborwiki.org/city/Jobs</a></p>
<p>As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide.</p>
<p>Quite a few positions are filled without going through online job boards, of course - but it never hurts to see what&#39;s posted and available.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us. He could find out literally anything.&quot;</blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>For reference, here&#39;s some prompting questions that are showing up in my social media streams. These change from time to time as online sites try to cajole, coerce, trigger or prompt people to participate online.</p>
<p>Typepad wants me to share this post, and to &quot;Enter a short message about your blog post to get people excited to come read it.&quot;</p>

<p>Facebook is asking me &quot;What&#39;s the best thing that&#39;s happened to you today?&quot; I&#39;m sure that this is not the only question that Facebook asks, based on other people&#39;s reports, but I haven&#39;t yet seen a comprehensive list of the prompts.</p>

Email is of course much harder to write than a wall post or a tweet, since you have to come up with To, Cc, Bcc, Subject and email text and since you can go well beyond 140 characters.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The city of Duluth, Minnesota has flooded after torrential rains. This map shows the rain intensity, with some areas getting more than 6 inches in a day.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017742949f2f970d-pi"><img alt="Picture 6" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017742949f2f970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017742949f2f970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 6" /></a><br />For local coverage, the <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/" target="_self">Duluth News Tribune</a>&#0160;(Twitter: @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/duluthnews" target="_self">duluthnews</a>) is a good source for detail. Minnesota Public Radio put together a stunning set of <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/06/20/disaster/duluth-flood-photos/" target="_self">photos of the Duluth floods</a>, including a picture of a seal that washed away from the Duluth Zoo (the seal is OK). The Minneapolis Star-Tribune also collected <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/159735785.html" target="_self">photos of the flood from citizens</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a scanner feed from Radio Reference for <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?feedId=6299" target="_self">local law enforcement and fire and rescue in the Duluth/Superior area</a>&#0160;which gives some sense for what&#39;s going on from moment to moment. When I tuned in this evening, the dispatcher was noting that they had run out of &quot;Road Closed&quot; signs, and were hoping to get more from the state.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been looking for a (very) local map that shows damage, but events are too chaotic right now to get that. <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/234930/" target="_self">Damage estimates are in the millions</a>, with extensive damage to infrastructure (roads, bridges) that will take time and money to fix.</p>
<p>Lots more detail is flooding by on Twitter on the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23duluthflood" target="_self">#duluthflood</a> tag.</p>
<p>Update 6/26/2012: This snapshot of an <a href="http://gisservices2.dot.state.mn.us/minnesotafloodmap/MNDOT_ROAD_CLOSURES.Web/MNDOT_ROAD_CLOSURESPage.html" target="_self">interactive map of Minnesota road closings from MNDOT</a> shows the widespread damage to roads, streets, and bridges in the Duluth area.</p>

There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Global-tuners-perth-australia" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-500wi" alt="Global-tuners-perth-australia" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. That&rsquo;s been successful up to a point, but compared to the last time I was following this world (20 years ago) there&rsquo;s a lot less in the English language and more in Chinese. Getting access to tuners around the world, especially to ones that have better antenna setups than I do, is remarkably handy.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can use a shortwave set for most of the time is listening to AM and FM stations that are aimed at a local audience. Here is where some of the most unusual listening comes in - it&rsquo;s just plain fun to tune in an Australian FM station (via a tuner in Australia) and listen to what ordinary radio sounds like there.</p>
<p>For best results, you&rsquo;ll want to pair this with some lookup tools that help you figure out what&rsquo;s on the air at that time that&rsquo;s likely to be heard in that part of the world. <a href="http://short-wave.info" target="_self">Short-wave.info</a> has a nice real time database of broadcast schedules, so that if you are tuning around the dial on shortwave you can see which stations are likely to be broadcasting. &nbsp;<a href="http://fmscan.org/index.php" target="_self">FMSCAN</a> has global listings of AM and FM stations, and <a href="http://www.mwlist.org/ul_login.php?sprache=en" target="_self">MWLIST</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;longwave, mediumwave, tropical bands and a shortwave radio database. It&rsquo;s the kind of information that I recall from sorting through the back pages of the World Radio and TV Handbook, except that it&rsquo;s all linked together (and more up to date than my 1980s copy).</p>

      <p>When you notice <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak.html" target="_self">a big LinkedIn password breach</a> one day, and then several other sites also announce problems in subsequent days, there seems to be a pattern worth noticing. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed of late.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/" target="_self">Flame virus uses a previously undiscovered attack on the MD5 cryptographic hash</a> in order to carry out some of its devious work.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flame is the first known example of an MD5 collision attack being used maliciously in a real-world environment. It wielded the esoteric technique to digitally sign malicious code with a fraudulent certificate that&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-malware-was-signed-by-rogue-microsoft-certificate/">appeared to originate with Microsoft</a>. By deploying fake servers on networks that hosted machines already infected by Flame—and using the certificates to sign Flame modules—the malware was able to&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flames-god-mode-cheat-code-wielded-to-hijack-windows-7-server-2008/">hijack the Windows Update mechanism</a>&#0160;Microsoft uses to distribute patches to hundreds of millions of customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking over Windows Update is game over for a compromised system, and of course it&#39;s also an efficient way to keep your bugged system up to date with the latest bugs. Flame is thus suspected of being created by a powerful nation-state, since the crypto needed to do this is beyond the grasp of but a few skilled mathematicians.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bricklink.com" target="_self">Bricklink</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/messageThread.asp?ID=133899&amp;amp;nID=642624" target="_self">their admin user id was stolen</a>, and a number of accounts were fraudulently merged together. No word yet on how the attacker(s) got access to the key account on the system, and I haven&#39;t seen any other reporting about problems at this LEGO trading site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a few people noticed, a number of major accounts were merged fraudulently&#0160;around 12:15 pm EDT today. As a merge is almost impossible to undo, the solution&#0160;was to do a database rollback to 12:00 PM EDT today. This breach was due to the&#0160;Admin user ID being stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>TheNextWeb writes about <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/06/07/change-your-last-fm-password-now-there-may-have-been-another-security-breach/" target="_self">problems at last.fm which is reporting a big password leak</a> on the scale of LinkedIn. The <a href="http://www.last.fm/passwordsecurity" target="_self">last.fm notice</a> reads in part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently investigating the leak of some Last.fm user passwords. This follows recent password leaks on other sites, as well as information posted online. As a precautionary measure, we’re asking all our users to change their passwords immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Passwords are a weak link in many online systems, and password database security gets short shrift in some growing startups. Perhaps these two tweets from Pinboard&#39;s founder&#0160;Maciej Ceglowski are worth noting to round out the report.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>Proud to reassure my users that&#0160;<strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;passwords are not only hashed and salted, but pan-seared and dusted with a saffron quince reduction</div>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>(rightly) exasperated security person asks me to admit that Pinboard uses bcrypt. But there is no known way to make a bcrypt tweet funny</div>

      </h3>
      <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!</p>
<p>I used the <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Home-Repair/Appliance-Repair/how-to-repair-a-leaking-washing-machine/View-All" target="_self">Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine</a>&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. The repair was made with <a href="http://www.duckbrand.com/Products/diy-products/diy-specialties/self-fusing-repair-tape.aspx" target="_self">Duck Brand Wrap-Fix Tape</a>, a self-fusing silicone tape that says it&#39;s good to 100 PSI.&#0160;And <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Stadium_Hardware" target="_self">Stadium Hardware</a>&#0160;(Arborwiki link) is a marvelous store, with helpful folks and a seemingly infinite supply of parts for every hardware need.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s just hope the repair holds! The next step, if it doesn&#39;t, is to replace that hose entirely. Repair Clinic has <a href="http://www.repairclinic.com/GE-Washing-Machine-Hose-Tube-Or-Fittings-Parts?z=100" target="_self">about 70 different GE washing machine hose parts available</a>; I haven&#39;t yet identified the exact part.&#0160;</p>
<p>Please note that the repair for the high-pressure supply hose would be very different, as noted in the comment below. The Family Handyman guide referenced above suggests getting a metallic no-burst supply hose <a href="http://www.fluidmaster.com/washing-machine-connectors.html/" target="_self">similar to this one from Fluidmaster</a> to replace any worn, corroded, or leaky supply hoses. Supply lines run at much higher pressure than drain lines.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Change your LinkedIn password.</p>
<p>News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. LinkedIn, for its part, has promised to strengthen its internal controls and introduce a &quot;salt&quot; into its password storage system.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/" target="_self">An update from LinkedIn</a>&#0160;acknowledges the leak. The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/06/technology/linkedin-password-hack/index.htm" target="_self">reporting from CNN</a> is unusually detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Countless passwords on the list contain the word &quot;linkedin.&quot; On a&#0160;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">popular hacker forum</a>, many reported finding passwords such as &quot;linkedout,&quot; &quot;recruiter,&quot; &quot;googlerecruiter,&quot; &quot;toprecruiter,&quot; &quot;superrecruiter,&quot; &quot;humanresources&quot; and &quot;hiring.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leak was complicated by LinkedIn&#39;s use of SHA-1 as its encryption scheme for passwords without using a &quot;salt&quot; to improve password security. <a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/06/06/a-salt-free-diet-is-bad-for-your-security/" target="_self">AgileBits has a good discussion of how salting works</a>, and why you should use it; in short, it adds a little more randomness to even bad passwords so that an attacker can&#39;t pre-compute the hashed stored passwords directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Bot and Alice use the same password (and so have the same hash of their passwords) they don’t have to worry about each other. Who they need to worry about is Charlie the Cracker. Charlie may have spent months running software that picks passwords and generates the hashes of those passwords. He will store those millions of passwords and their hashes in a database called a “Rainbow Table.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without a rainbow table, modern password cracking hardware is mighty fast. How fast? <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2012/06/confirmed-linkedin-6mil-password-dump.html" target="_self">Robert Graham from Errata Security lays it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;How fast can hackers crack passwords? The answer &quot;2 billion per second&quot; using the Radeon HD 7970 (the latest top-of-the-line graphics processor). Each letter of a password has 100 combinations (UPPER, lower, d1g1ts, $ymbols). A 5 letter password therefore has&#0160;<tt>100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100</tt>&#0160;or 10 billion combinations, meaning it can be cracked in 5 seconds. A 6 letter password has 100 times that, or 500 seconds. A 7 letter password has 100 times that, or 50,000 seconds, or 13 hours. An 8 character password is roughly 57 days. A 9 character password is 100 times that, about 15 years. In other words, if your password was 7 letters, the hacker has already cracked it, but if it&#39;s 9 letters, it&#39;s too difficult to crack with brute force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, &quot;too difficult&quot; for one computer is not the same as &quot;too difficult&quot; for a network of computing resources. Thomas Roth in 2010 on <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/15/cracking-in-the-cloud-amazons-new-ec2-gpu-instances/" target="_self">Cracking Passwords in the Cloud</a>&#0160;on Amazon&#39;s EC2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the CUDA-Multiforce, I was able to crack all hashes from&#0160;<a href="http://stacksmashing.net/blogfiles/2010_11_15/sha1_hashes.txt">this</a>&#0160;file with a password length from 1-6 in only 49 Minutes (1 hour costs 2.10$ by the way.):</p>
<div>
<div>Compute done: Reference time 2950.1 seconds<br />Stepping rate: 249.2M MD4/s<br />Search rate: 3488.4M NTLM/s</div>
</div>
<p>This just shows one more time that SHA1 for password hashing is deprecated – You really don’t want to use it anymore! Instead, use something like scrypt or PBKDF2! Just imagine a whole cluster of these machines (which is now easily available to anybody thanks to Amazon) cracking passwords for you. Pretty comfortable, large-scale password cracking for everybody!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 6 character SHA-1 hashes would cost about $2 to crack in 2010 computer-dollars; 7 characters, $200; 8 characters, $20,000; and 9 characters, &quot;only&quot; $2 million. <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/20/cracking-passwords-in-the-cloud-getting-the-facts-straight/" target="_self">Roth further concludes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that was new is that, due to the new Amazon offering, everyone is able to spawn a 100-or-more node cluster in the cloud and distribute the task of cracking passwords onto these nodes. The task of cracking hashes is especially suitable for massive parallelization! An attacker could easily spawn a gigantic cluster of nodes using stolen credit card information, and it would be no problem for him to crack 8-character passwords in a nice timeframe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, &quot;recruiter&quot;, step up your game (and change your password, and your password algorithm).</p>

<p>University Lowbrow Astronomers has a <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~lowbrows/calendar/venus-transit.html" target="_self">page full of Venus transit information</a> for Ann Arbor area locals, including viewing parties at local observatories and at the Traverwood Library. The <a href="http://www.glaac.org/the-transit-of-venus/" target="_self">Great Lakes Association of Astronomy Clubs has a similar list of Venus transit viewing sites</a> statewide if you want to meet up with others while watching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your location, the 2012 transit will take place either June 5 or June 6. If you live in Southeast Michigan, the transit will occur on the evening of June 5 from approximately 6PM until sunset. More information can about the Venus Transit be found at&#0160;<a href="http://www.transitofvenus.org/">http://www.transitofvenus.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The weather does not portend favorable viewing conditions - there&#39;s a chance of rain, and forecast for 50-60% cloud cover. See <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=zmw:48104.1.99999&amp;hourly=1&amp;yday=156&amp;weekday=Tuesday" target="_self">the Weather Underground forecast for Ann Arbor for details</a>.</p>
<p>If you decide to watch the transit of Venus online, there should be a lot of places streaming it. Here&#39;s a few to save some time when it comes to hurry indoors.</p>
<p><a href="http://events.slooh.com/" target="_self">Slooh Space Camera</a>&#0160;will run about a dozen feeds from a variety of sources.</p>
<p><a href="http://keckobservatory.org/news/venus_transit_live_keck_observatory" target="_self">Keck Observatory in Hawaii</a> is planning a Venus transit live feed.</p>
<p><a href="http://venustransit.nasa.gov/transitofvenus/" target="_self">NASA&#39;s Sun Earth Day</a> has a series of Transit of Venus feeds.</p>
<p>Back in 1882, there was also a transit of Venus; the <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/06/05/transit-of-venus-1882/" target="_self">Public Domain Review has a roundup of images from those viewing expeditions.</a>&#0160;Science!</p>

      <p>Why oh why can&#39;t we have a&#0160;<em>better press corps</em>?</p>
<p>I am sure that all this “you’re doing it wrong” media criticism hearkens back to a golden era of competition in journalism, so <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2012/06/02/milestone-integrity-and-a-sense-of-place/" target="_self">bully for you all</a>&#0160;in stirring up a Newhouse/funhouse fight.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of throwing up wadded old balls of newsprint at each other you could both get back to focus on accurate attention to details, expressed concisely enough to be grasped.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://newsofannarbor.blogspot.com/2011/07/chronicle-opus-crashes-web.html" target="_self">Chronicle suffers for writing 4200 words</a> when at times a well-chosen 500 words would say a lot more. AnnArbor.com suffers for being too quick to write the 500 words based on first impressions and then letting its <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bestofa2com" target="_self">ill-informed commenting crew</a> fill in the rest instead of preparing a good followup to tie up loose ends. Neither one covers the whole of what is going on in this town.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do.</p>
<p>Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The maddening part of the network that doesn&#39;t work is that instead of working with the network you end up working to repair the network, and its unreliablity neither gives you access nor downtime.  In other words, spotty wifi is bad, worse than no wifi at all.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My Mac is in the shop. It&#39;s getting a new wifi card, and while they are at it they&#39;ll replace the chipped case. The chip fixing means that labor is free for the wifi fixing so it&#39;s a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The last time I had any kind of extended computer downtime I remember it being a strain, since I then had so much of my personal computing stuff actually on my computer. Now more than ever that&#39;s not the case, and I get along just fine with occasional logins from library computer systems or even the ultra-basic stripped down version of apps that I get on my not-very-smart Blackberry.</p>
<p>At some point, everything that you care enough about is also in the cloud somewhere. That might be for backups, so that if you lose a system you can carry on with minimum restore time. It might be to increase the power of whatever web-enabled terminal you log into, so that whatever public system you connect to has most of your stuff even if that stuff is private. Mostly though things go into the cloud and stay there because all physical media are fragile. The consequences of relying on anything in your own possession - especially something that gets knocked around a bit - are too great, and it&#39;s better to have those things also or primarily somewhere else that feels safe.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><span>(originally posted January 26, 2003</span>&#0160;)</p>
<p>SEMOLINA PUDDING<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 cup milk<br />4 cups water<br />grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)<br />1 cup semolina flour<br />cinnamon<br />raspberries or other berries<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. Remove from heat and pour into bowl, mold, or cupcake pan. Refrigerate for at least two hours. Pudding should be somewhat firmer than chocolate pudding, but less firm than jello.<br /><br />When ready to serve, unmold pudding or leave in bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon. Top with raspberries or other fruit. Sugared raspberries are particularly nice when a little bit of sauce is formed and can be poured over the pudding.<br /><br />The pudding has a texture that is somehow both agreeably grainy and smooth and is very cooling in the summertime. You can vary the milk:water ratio in the recipe, even to the point of omitting one or the other entirely.<br /><br />(thanks to puddingmeister Deb for the recipe)</p>
