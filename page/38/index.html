<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>As I listen to a plane go overhead today, I remember how quiet it was here in Ann Arbor after 9/11 when the entire US airspace was shut down. You could hear the birds a lot more easily, and the sky was clear.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/the-day-after-what-9122001-was-like.html" target="_self">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/june04/geophen.html" target="_self">Geotimes, 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The empty skies also allowed David Travis of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and his co-workers to determine how contrails might be changing local temperature. Their results, first published in&#0160;<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/418601a.html" target="_self"><em>Nature</em>&#0160;in August 2002</a> and further elucidated last March in the&#0160;<em>Journal of Climate</em>, showed that during the days when jets were grounded in September 2001, sunshine increased the temperature at ground level instead of being reflected by contrails. At night, the researchers found, the absence of an insulating layer of contrails meant greater ground level cooling.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s hard to think that this happened more than a decade ago.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-30-hurricane-isaac-flood-maps-and-flooding-predictions/">Hurricane Isaac flood maps and flooding predictions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Isaac brought with it high winds and a substantial amount of rain, and both of those combined has led to a lot of flooding. Here are some maps I&#39;ve collected while the storm is still underway. You should know that for each of them I&#39;ll also give a link to the underlying mapping source so that you can get current information.</p>
<p>If you are in the affected area and need details about flooded roads or the risk of dams or levees bursting or anything else, <strong>do not trust this weblog for current information</strong>; seek out official and up to date sources.</p>
<p>Most of the maps are dated August 30, 2012, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>Rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for maps of observed precipitation is <a href="http://water.weather.gov" target="_self">water.weather.gov</a>, specifically the <a href="http://water.weather.gov/precip/" target="_self">AHPS</a> (Advanced Hydrometeorological Prediction Service). Here&#39;s a 7 day observed rainfall for Louisiana from that service, showing some areas with upwards of 20 inches of observed rainfall.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" /></a><br /><strong>Predicted rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for rainfall predictions running out to the next 5 days (120 hours) is the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/day1-5.shtml" target="_self">Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF).</a>&#0160;These models are updated several times a day and give rainfall estimates over the entire country. (Your rainfall will differ.) This is the run from Thursday, August 30, 2012, showing a predicted 5 day course for the remnants of Isaac to dump rain up the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-pi"><img alt="P120i00" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="P120i00" /></a><strong>Predicted flooding</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Serivce <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/wwa/" target="_self">Watch, Warning, Advisory Display</a>&#0160;shows this map with areas in pale green with warnings of potential floods, darker green (Arkansas) with current flood conditions, and parts of Louisiana and Mississippi with flash flood warnings. The accompanying text for some forecasts note that because of the dry and drought conditions the ground will be hard, and thus less able to absorb moisture leading to heavy runoff and flooding.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 13" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 13" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><strong>River gauges, current</strong></p>
<p>Many rivers have flood gauges which measure and report current flood status. This is a map from water.weather.gov&#39;s River Observations page showing the whole nation, with flooding marked in color. You can zoom in to individual observations as well.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-river-observations" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-river-observations" /></a><br />Here&#39;s a zoom of the New Orleans area for the same data. Please note that the gauges are only on rivers, and will not show flash flood areas, levee breaches, or other places where water is not usually found.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 11" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 11" /></a><br /><strong>Satellite imagery</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for satellite photos that show flooding; those usually don&#39;t appear until after the storm has cleared, because any imagery sensitive to water will pick up the clouds first. &#0160;Here&#39;s a NASA Aqua/MODIS image, pulled from their <a href="http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/rapid-response" target="_self">Rapid Response Imagery</a> datasets.</p>

      <p>From the news release:</p>
<blockquote>The&#0160;<a href="http://thegalleryproject.com" target="_self">Gallery Project</a> presents&#0160;<em>Quantified Self</em>, a multimedia exhibit in which 34 local, regional, and national artists examine how individuals collect and often project information about themselves and others in the digital world. Artists examine the quantified self from two unique perspectives: one, how information about individuals is collected, stored, processed, and used by these individuals and communicated to others; and two how entities collect information about individuals and groups for commercial and other purposes. Examples are self-projections in cyber space, self-monitoring of health and other behaviors, obsessive collecting of self-defining artifacts, and visualizing personal and group data.</blockquote>

<p>The gallery opened today, August 30, 2012; the reception is on the evening of August 31, 2012, and I&#39;ll probably miss it. Artists that I recognized included <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/" target="_self">Edward Tufte</a> who had three very lovely prints from one of his books on display, and <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/" target="_self">Mark EJ Newman</a> who had some remarkably presented <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/" target="_self">cartograms</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Visit them at 215 S. Fourth Ave in downtown Ann Arbor, across from Eastern Accents (and thus handy to visit after A2B3).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Each year is a new hurricane season, and each year the internet is a little different. Here&#39;s some things that are new that I&#39;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come. The word of the year is &quot;<a href="http://www.spaghettimodels.com" target="_self">spaghetti model</a>&quot;, illustrated below, showing a whole series of separate tracks from different atmospheric models to predict a set of possible futures for the storm.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-pi"><img alt="643281402" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="643281402" /></a><br />Another novel thing this year is the appearance of the hurricane app for your smart phone or iPad. <a href="http://kittycode.com/products/hurricane-hd/" target="_self">Hurricane HD</a>&#0160;for your iPad focuses solely on hurricane tracking, giving you alerts and forecasts and graphical updates as conditions change. (I haven&#39;t used it, but the screen shots look good and straightforward). The <a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/New-Hurricane-App-Brings-Safety-Information-to-Smart-Phones" target="_self">Red Cross Hurricane App</a>&#0160;includes&#0160;“I’m safe” messaging that allows users to broadcast reassurance to family and friends via social media outlets that they are out of harm’s way. Both have access to <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/" target="_self">NOAA Weather Radio</a>, which is one of the typical channels found on any of the scanner apps that are available.</p>
<p>If you are interested in listening to hurricane radio traffic, one good source is <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>. In addition to listening to police scanners and fire service radios, you can also tune into the <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?feedId=9559" target="_self">National Hurricane Center SKYWARN network</a>&#0160;and hear weather and condition reports directly from amateur radio operators in the field.</p>
<p>One thing that hasn&#39;t changed is the excellent hurricane coverage from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" target="_self">Weather Underground</a>, with the <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html" target="_self">weblog of Dr. Jeff Masters</a> a clear and precise account as conditions change. The comment board on this blog is notable for being well behaved and well informed, a rarity in this day and age. Weather Underground was recently purchased by Weather.com. There&#39;s no visible changes yet to hurricane information, but a few more TWC meteorologists are blogging on the wunderground site.</p>
<p>Here in Michigan, the worst we can expect from a hurricane is flooding from the far-north remnants of a storm. Others will not be so lucky. Do your best to be prepared.</p>

      <p>For the most part, I don&#39;t comment on newspaper web sites any more; it&#39;s generally more effective to engage by writing the same message directly to the reporter or to the editor.</p>
<p>In some cases, good results can also be had by sending messages directly to the parties involved in the story, and cc&#39;ing (or bcc&#39;ing) the reporter in question.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect.</p>
<p>The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZxe-2rtOGo" target="_self">video from &quot;battlebauble&quot; on YouTube</a> looks convincing. We ended up picking out the bones after it had been cooked.</p>
<p>The trout was from the <a href="http://www.springvalleytroutfarm.com/" target="_self">Spring Valley Trout Farm</a> in Dexter, and the boys were there as part of Summers-Knoll summer &quot;Escape Camp&quot;.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-17-twitter-api-changes-cause-obvious-problems-for-developers/">Twitter API changes cause obvious problems for developers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &quot;I&#39;m eating a sandwich&quot;.) Here&#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.</p>
<p>From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &quot;<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes" target="_self">Interpreting some of Twitter&#39;s API changes</a>&quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application. His conclusion is stark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter has left themselves a lot of wiggle-room with the rules. Effectively, Twitter can decide your app is breaking a (potentially vague) rule at any time, or they can add a new rule that your app inadvertently breaks, and revoke your API access at any time. [...]</p>
<p>I sure as hell wouldn’t build a business on Twitter, and I don’t think I’ll even build any nontrivial&#0160;<em>features</em>&#0160;on it anymore.</p>
<p>And if I were in the Twitter-client business, I’d start working on another product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="http://app.net" target="_self">App.net</a> has grand designs to be a Twitter clone, based on three elements: a solid realtime engine for data, a well defined open API, and a subscription supported model (rather than an advertising supported model) for making the whole thing pay. Dalton Caldwell&#39;s manifesto is a worthwhile read, &quot;<a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal" target="_self">Announcing an audacious proposal</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe so deeply in the importance of having a financially sustainable realtime feed API &amp; service that I am going to refocus App.net to become&#0160;<strong>exactly that</strong>. I have the experience, vision, infrastructure and team to do it. Additionally, we already have much of this built: a polished native iOS app, a robust technical infrastructure currently capable of handing ~200MM API calls per day with no code changes, and a developer-facing API provisioning, documentation and analytics system. This isn’t vaporware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/global/" target="_self">alpha.app.net channel</a>&#0160;is full of want to be superstar application developers figuring out how their new idea could work in this new space.</p>
<p>There are two applications that I use that could be affected by this set of changes. One is Pinboard, which is a bookmarking tool that (among other things) reads and archives my Twitter stream. Pinboard&#39;s developer Maciej Ceglowski has a very funny, no holds barred <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard" target="_self">Twitter account for Pinboard</a>, where he among other things promotes his own service by retweeting posts from the accounts of his competitor Delicious. Here&#39;s his take on app.net:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 7" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 7" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;d be sad if my Twitter backups didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The unusual Twitter client that I use which is most likely to run up against the new look-and-feel guidelines of the Twitter API is <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/" target="_self">ttytter</a>, a command line client written in Perl by Cameron Kaiser. It looks nothing like the official Twitter apps of any kind.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 8" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 8" /></a><br />It&#39;s hard enough to insist on API and look-and-feel rules with applications that are user configurable; imagine what it must be like to enforce those rules when the application is delivered as relatively easy to modify source code. How can you make sure people don&#39;t break the rules if they can change their own code?</p>
<p>Twitter has some reasonable reasons to want to narrow the scope of what third parties can do with their service, but it&#39;s not going to come without a fight. Expect a tug of war between innovation and conformity, and it&#39;s safe to say that some of that innovation that comes at a high cost and low value to Twitter will be squashed out. I&#39;ll be particularly interested in the delicate balance between value provided by Twitter to advertisers (who pay directly) and social media marketers (who often ride for free) on the service.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m working on a lot of things, or so it seems, but right now I just want to write.</p>
<p>The working environment at the moment is the Chrome browser, with 6 tabs open. Two are Gmail accounts, one is Twitter, one is the Typepad dashboard from which I&#39;m writing this, and one is a Google Analtyics window set to &quot;real time&quot; view for Arborwiki. A sixth tab is currently on Google search, but it varies from time to time.</p>
<p>There are people who keep hundreds of open tabs, but I&#39;m not one of them - my usual plan for dealing with a surplus of work in progress is either to blog or twitter about it or to pin up a bookmark with Pinboard and then close the window.</p>
<p>Most notably from a productivity perspective is that Facebook doesn&#39;t fit into the picture. My Facebook stream has turned into a political circus, and I don&#39;t like wading through artful graphics making fun of politicians on all sides. It&#39;s tedious, and it makes me think that I could give up on Facebook mostly and not miss it.</p>

<p>BikePlanner was created by&#0160;<a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a>, a nonprofit group based in New York that wants to use technology to improve transportation. The organization also worked on&#0160;<a href="http://cibi.me/">CiBi.me</a>, a trip planner for New York City’s (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/nyregion/new-york-city-tells-little-about-bike-share-delay.html">delayed</a>) bike-sharing&#0160;<a href="http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/">program</a>&#0160;and on a trip planner for&#0160;<a href="http://ride.trimet.org/">the TriMet transit system&#0160;</a>in the Portland, Ore., area.</p>
<p>The bike-trip planners for New York and Washington were built as demonstrations, said Kevin Webb, the Washington-based co-director of transportation at OpenPlans. Much of the technical work was already done for the Portland project, so it wasn’t a huge leap to create the new sites.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>How many people do you need to know before it&#39;s likely that two have the same full name?</p>
<p>The answer is going to depend critically on the pool of people you are sampling from, and whether you count people in multiple generations as Sr., Jr. as &quot;same name&quot;. Similarly, middle initials or middle names will be distinguishing marks. What I&#39;m after is less about collisions within a family and more about two John Jones in your addressbook, otherwise completely unrelated.</p>
<p>I suspect that the number is in the low thousands, just from personal experience.&#0160;</p>
<p>How would you approach this problem?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>After writing about power problems that affected thousands of homes, it&#39;s hard to imagine a problem that would take out 700 million subscribers. But that&#39;s just the problem facing India, which has seen failures of its transmission grid in two days straight - the biggest power outage ever.</p>
<p>Some sources for more information:</p>
<p>The Guardian, UK. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/31/india-blackout-electricity-power-cuts" target="_self">&quot;Power cuts plunge 20 of India&#39;s 28 states into darkness as energy suppliers fail to meet growing demand&quot;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 700 million people in&#0160;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india" title="More from guardian.co.uk on India">India</a>&#0160;have been left without power in the world&#39;s worst modern blackout, prompting fears that protests and even riots could follow if the country&#39;s electricity supply continues to fail to meet growing demand.</p>
<p>Twenty of India&#39;s 28 states were hit by power cuts, along with the capital, New Delhi, when three of the five electricity grids failed at lunchtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Power Grid Corporation of India&#39;s <a href="http://www.powergridindia.com/PGCIL_NEW/news.aspx" target="_self">press release on the subject</a> provides some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A disturbance occurred in the NR, ER and NER electricity grid at 1300 hours today leading to a blackout in these regions except survival of small pockets in Delhi, Kolkata, Narora etc. Supply to affected regions is being extended from Western and Southern Region grids. Presently supply to NR has been extended from Gwalior on Gwalior-Agra line up to Delhi stations. Supply to railway traction and metro has been restored to almost all the points. Hydro Stations in NR have been started and supply has restored up to Punjab and Haryana areas also. Startup supply has been extended to Singrauli, Rihand via Vindhyachal and startup supply to Talchar has been extended from Western Region It is expected that supply to all the major points in affected regions shall be made available in 2 to 3 of hours time.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/07/31/live-blog-power-blackout-in-india-again/" target="_self">live-blogged the blackout</a>&#0160;for the second day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bad day for India, however you look at it. The government was forced to admit not just a serious shortage of power but also of water. These are without question two of India’s biggest long-term challenges.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Microcoworking is independent workers and freelancers working together at the same time in a coffee shop, sharing ideas and conversation. It&#39;s more informal than the coworking facilities that have sprung up all over the country, but it shares with them the idea that just because you&#39;re working on your own you don&#39;t have to be alone.</p>
<p>Today Laura Fisher, Patti Smith and I restarted a microcoworking cell that had been on hiatus for a while, meeting at Zingerman&#39;s Next Door. We did some editing work together, Patti and I, and Laura showed off her stylish <a href="https://www.sensubrush.com/" target="_self">Sensu brush</a> for the iPad. The music started out as a 70s mix which gave us all the appropriate flashbacks in time.</p>
