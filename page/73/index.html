<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>&quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&quot;  (<a href="http://www.bigcontrarian.com/2008/07/21/tacky/">Jack Shedd</a>)</p>
<p>Jack has more in a rant that&#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &quot;cheese food manufacturing&quot; that <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/07/21/blog-pimping">Merlin Mann</a> observes as dominating the world of &quot;pro bloggers&quot;.</p>
<p>In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &quot;pick any two&quot; is the easiest answer.  It&#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system.&#0160;Writing well and with passion and not often gives you an occasional lovely essay but not enough page views to get ads worth anything.  And writing often and with passion generally is all about passion for attention and for the ad-fueled money that goes with it.</p>

<p>It's just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.</p>

<p>There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor.  The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm.  <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/07/dexter-blueberr.html">Last year they charged $1.35 per pound for U-Pick</a>, and it was easy to fill a five pound bucket in a single session.</p>

<p>Note that the Main Street Bridge through Dexter is closed to eastbound traffic, so if you are heading back to Ann Arbor you'll go around downtown Dexter.  See the <a href="http://www.villageofdexter.org/">Village of Dexter web site</a> for details and a construction webcam.</p>

<p>Slightly farther away is <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/The_Blueberry_Patch">The Blueberry Patch</a> in Grass Lake, just east of Jackson.  The berries are organic, and they use nets to keep away the birds.</p>

<p>The other part of the state where I know a bit of detail is in the southwestern corner (known as Michiana) near New Buffalo, MI, Michigan City IN and the surrounding area.  I scanned in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/1225078024/">list of Michiana blueberry picking farms</a> when we were there last year, and that info should still be good.  It's the closest Michigan berrypicking you'll get if you're coming from Chicagoland.</p>

<p>Leduc Blueberries near Kalamazoo has <a href="http://www.leducblueberries.com/extra.iml">a collection of eight years worth of annual blueberry recipes</a> (PDF), which include the usual bakes, crumbles, pies and the like plus a series of dinner salads like a <a href="http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&controller=article&category_id=157&article=18460">blueberry lemon chicken salad</a>.</p>

<p>Other blueberry crop news:</p>

<p>A report from Hammonton, New Jersey predicts an <a href="http://www.thehammontonnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/LIFESTYLE/806250307/1024/NEWS17">average New Jersey blueberry crop for 2008</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
"The hot weather that we've been having has had some effects on the ripening and harvesting of our products, though the cooler-than-normal ground temperatures and, until recently, cool overnight temperatures have helped to somewhat mitigate the day heat," said William Walker of the New Jersey Department Agriculture's Jersey Fresh program. "The season was slow to begin, but we're now on a normal production schedule."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>DeGrandchamp Farms predicts a good 2008 season:<br />
<blockquote><br />
As I write this article, the 2008 blueberry crop looks like it has the potential to be an excellent one. I believe a lot has to do with the excellent growing season last summer which produced good growth and bud set. </p>

<p>Wholesale prices for the fresh market were strong last year and should continue for the 2008 season. Demand for blueberries is strong for the processing market as more manufacturers are using blueberries in their product lines. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CropValuSu/CropValuSu-02-14-2008.txt">USDA crop price report</a> for the last three years for blueberries:<br/>
2005: $1.44/lb<br />
2006: $1.76/lb        <br />
2007: $1.83/lb </p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/ready-to-pick-michigan-blueberries/">Absolute Michigan has a Ready To Pick feature on blueberries</a> with recipes and crop and grower info.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for in comments:</p>

<p>Have you gone blueberry picking recently, and how was it?<br />
Where do you go wild (not cultivated) berry picking - if not precisely where, then at least the township?<br />
What do you know about mechanical blueberry harvesters?<br />
Have you ever used a blueberry rake, and is it easy to make one out of ordinary materials by hand?<br />
What are your favorite blueberry recipes?<br />
How do you preserve blueberries for February in Michigan when it's gray all the time?<br />
What varieties of blueberry are good for growing in your yard, and what soil do you need?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while, you run across something so wonderful you have to share.</p>

<p>I have been tracking hits to the Google search <a href="http://google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders">Michigan spiders</a>, ever since an odd combination of page text about automated web browsing tools unearthed a bunch of folks trying to identify the spiders crawling across their day lilies.</p>

<p>Today's search logs turned up this amazing resource, the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">The Backyard Arthropod Project<br />
A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>.  The author writes:<br />
<blockquote><br />
This started out as a typical ranting blog over on Livejournal, but it turns out that, overall, I’m a happy sort of guy and don’t really have that many things to rant about. As of February 2007, it has instead turned into a project to document every arthropod that I can find on our property (about 9 acres on the north slope of Old Mill Hill in the Keeweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan). This includes insects, spiders, other arachnids, crustaceans, and pretty much anything I find with an exoskeleton. There should be at least one new arthropod every week, for as long as the variety holds out (which could be years). I’ll also randomly inject whatever thoughts happen to occur to me at the time, although I’ll try to stick with at least some connection to the topic at hand. When I run out of arthropods, maybe I’ll start in on the plants.</p>

<p>While I have always been interested in insects and other arthropods, I unfortunately have zero formal training in entomology (I am an extractive metallurgist by profession), so I’m basically trying to learn arthropod taxonomy as I go. I will doubtless make many mistakes, please don’t hesitate to correct me when I am wrong.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Go, look.  There are pictures, there are bugs - arachnids, isopods, diptera, cutworm moths, crickets, katydids.  There are tags: <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-house/">found in house</a> and <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-yard/">found in yard</a> stand in equal prominence.  9 acres in the UP yields plenty of bugs, in season, and season is year-round, as the presence of the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/2008/01/19/snow-fly/">snow fly - Chionea valga</a> will attest.</p>

<p>This is why people live in the UP!  Bugs, all with Latin names!</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-26-kilowatts-per-t/">kilowatts per terabyte, or terabytes per kilowatt: a measure of storage energy efficiency</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A measure of the efficiency of data storage; the equivalent would be W/GB (watts per gigabyte).</p>

<p>The range measured below is 0.4 TB/KW (RAM) to 500 TB/KW (Blu-ray disks), with a corresponding range in access speed and update times.</p>

<p>Some estimates or measures:</p>

<p>If you are using solid state memory (no disk; just memory, configured as disk) from <a href="http://www.superssd.com/products/tera-ramsan/">Texas Memory Systems</a>, expect to have 2.5 KW/TB, or 0.4 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The Tera-RamSan incorporates specially designed 4-Gbit Fibre Channel or 4x InfiniBand interfaces that include performance-enhancing hardware to reduce I/O latency to under 14 microseconds. With I/O requests being served so quickly, an order-of-magnitude more requests per second are executed by a single Tera-RamSan interface as compared to other Fibre Channel interfaces. By scaling SSD modules up to 8 units (8 Fibre Channel links per unit or 4 InfiniBand links per unit), the Tera-RamSan is the ultimate storage solution for high-performance applications in total IOPS and total bandwidth. Also, because the Tera-RamSan is DDRRAM based, there is NO penalty for RANDOM accesses. Data requests need not be tuned for performance. User access time is not compromised, even if tens of thousands of users access the system simultaneously. Extreme performance is the key feature of the Tera-RamSan.  <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html">From 2005, Pierre Devries: including cooling</a> about 1 KW/TB, or 1 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Working off Barroso, Dean and Hölzle’s paper on the Google cluster architecture, I infer that the energy consumption for storage is approximately 1W/GB: a dual 1.4-GHz Intel Pentium III server with a two 80GB drives draws 120W per server. Adding Google’s estimate of about 40% for cooling, gives 165 W per 160 GB, or 1 W/GB (watt/gigabyte). <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>in the <a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html?showComment=1120610880000#c112061093215420698">comments to that post</a>, using the archive.org architecture: 50W/TB, or 20 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Capricorn tech clains that their Petabox storage, which they built for archive.org, runs as little as 50W/TB. I don't think that number includes the power consumption of the required air conditioning.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>updating <a href="http://www.capricorn-tech.com/products.php">Capricorn's Petabox to the current (2008) web site</a>, we see 27W/TB, or 37 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The PetaBox is completely scalable, from individual terabyte nodes to petabyte clusters. A single 19-inch rack can support up to 120TB of raw disk space. This density is achieved through an economy of design that consumes as little as 27 watts per terabyte.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/03/23/222467/solving-storage-power-and-cooling-concerns.htm">Computer Weekly in 2007</a> talks about metrics but doesn't actually measure:<br />
<blockquote><br />
An individual drive uses 5W to 15W of power depending on its capacity, rotation speed, form factor and operating state, but "you can't just multiply the number of drives in an array by some average power rating to get a total," says Mark Greenlaw, senior director with storage marketing at EMC. The power consumption of the array is more than the sum of the power used by the individual drives. Controllers and other components consume power. Copan Systems proposes two metrics for archival data storage: storage density measured in terabytes per square foot and terabytes per kilowatt.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.copansystems.com/news/press_releases.php?press_id=64">A COPAN Systems press release from 2007</a>; naturally, take press releases for what they are worth.  The range from 4 TB/KW (Fibre Channel), 17 TB/KW (SATA), and 100 TB/KW (COPAN's sooper stuffs):<br />
<blockquote><br />
COPAN Systems has taken a "revolutionary" approach in how it has engineered its products over the past 4 years to deal with power and cooling issues in the data center. The low power requirements of COPAN's enhanced MAID architecture integrated with the extremely large storage density delivers in excess of an impressive 100 terabyte (TB) per kilowatt, the highest in the industry. This compares to an average power density for Fibre Channel disk products of approximately 4 TB per kilowatt and an average rate for standard SATA disk products of 17 TB per kilowatt. The savings are significant with estimates for power and cooling savings between $5.7 million and $7.8 million over a four year time period.<br />

MAID, or "massive array of idle disks", if you don't know it, is an architecture where the drives are usually powered down; you wouldn't use it for active hot storage, but for mostly offline stuff it's a possible solution.</p>

      <p>via the <a href="http://www.sovlit.com/bios/mayakovsky.html">V. V. Mayakovsky bio in the Encyclopedia of Soviet Authors</a>:</p>

<p>In 1925 Mayakovsky also made one of his few forays into the sphere of utopian science fiction with his poem Letaiushchi Proletarii ("The Flying Proletarian"). As described by Victor Tarras in his biography of Mayakovsky, The Flying Proletarian was:</p>

<blockquote>...set in the year 2125 and features a giant air battle, with death rays and such, between the Soviet proletarian and the American bourgeois air forces. The latter prevails until an uprising of New York workers against their government turns the tide. Mayakovsky's communist future is all comfort and electric ease: electric razors, electric toothbrushes, everybody with his own private airplane (Moscow no longer has any streets, just airports). Labor is wholly mechanized, so that a worker merely operates a keyboard. Altogether, Mayakovsky's utopia is written from the viewpoint of a laborer who is tired of backbreaking, dirty work. . . . There are no kitchens, no housework. People eat in aerocafeterias and amuse themselves with cosmic cinemas, cosmic dances, and such--all nonalcoholic (alcohol is served by prescription only). The sport of the future is avio-polo--football has long since been abandoned as crude and boring.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-24-mechanical-blue/">mechanical blueberry harvesters</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If you're serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation.  Here's an example of a <a href="http://www.dbe.ca/blueberryharvester.htm">blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia</a></p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels. This rotation is at a speed in ratio to the forward motion of the tractor. As the comb type-picking bars rake the blueberries from the plants they are carried around the reel and deposited in a conveyor. This conveyor delivers them to another longer conveyor, which carries them to the rear three-point-hitch mounted loading platform. As the berries fall from the conveyor a blower cleans them.
</blockquote>

<p>The harvester was invented by <a href="http://www.nsac.ns.ca/halloffame/citations/bragg_douglas.htm">R. Douglas Bragg</a> (1930-1996):</p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg always maintained a strong interest in the blueberry industry. Not only was he a manufacturer of the patented wild blueberry harvester and a blueberry producer himself, but he was an active member of the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia. From 1979 to 1981 he served as a Director and was an active member of the Research Committee from the time of its inception until the fall of 1996. He was a Founding Director of the Nova Scotia Blueberry Institute and was instrumental in the early days of its development and building of the research field station at Debert. In 1995 Doug received the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia Award of Recognition.
</blockquote>

<p>There's a set of patents on blueberry harvesters.  Here's what US Patent <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5375403/description.html">5365403, Lowbush berry harvester</a> has to say about the Bragg patented harvester:</p>

<blockquote>
A later development is reported in Canadian Pat. No. 1,249,727 of Bragg Lumber Company. According to the patent, this harvester mounts a picking head, almost identical to the Chisholm-Ryder head, on the side of a farm tractor, but in such a manner that the picking head is "towed " by the tractor. The arrangement ostensibly accommodates variations in the ground by allowing for pitch and roll of the head during operation. As with the Chisholm-Ryder head, the tines of the Bragg harvester are controlled by a cam and cam follower arrangement. In the Bragg harvester, as the tines approach top dead centre of the reel they are caused to flap rapidly to dislodge the berries carried thereby for easy deposit on the internal conveyor.
</blockquote>

<p>On my favorite blueberry-picking grounds, there's way too many ferns, jack pines, jack pine cones, bits of lichen and moss to ever make it suited for mechanical harvesting; just as well.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-23-vacuum-microwav/">vacuum microwave dried blueberries, a quality report</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Whenever I come across some topic related to both blueberries and the title of this blog (vacuum), I am compelled to post it.  In this case, we have "vacuum microwave drying" or VMD, a food preservation technique using a vacuum chamber and a microwave energy source instead of a typical hot air or freeze drying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engineer.msu.ac.th/CD_Conference/conference/CD-Conferance/IDS2000/home/pdf/318.pdf">QUALITY OF THE VACUUM MICROWAVE DRIED BLUEBERRIES IN TERMS <br />
OF COLOR, COMPOSITION, AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY <br />
Ziba Vaghri, Christine H. Scaman, David D. Kitts, Timothy D. Durance, and David A.J. <br />
McArthur</a></p>

<blockquote>
Vacuum microwave drying has great potential to produce high quality food products with greater retention of heat and oxygen sensitive bioactive components. Blueberries have recently been noted for their high antioxidant activity.  The components that are likely to be responsible for this activity are the phenolic compounds and vitamin C content.  This study compared the effects of vacuum microwave, air, freeze, and a combination of air/vacuum microwave drying on vitamin C, anthocyanin, phenolic, and antioxidant activity of two blueberry cultivars.  In addition the color characteristics of the berries were assessed. Vacuum microwave dried berries retained higher amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanin, and phenolics than air-dried berries. All blueberry extracts exhibited antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to anthocyanin, total phenolic and vitamin C content. There was no significant difference between the antioxidant activities of vacuum microwave dried and freeze-dried blueberries.

      </h3>
      <p>     <br />
Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br />
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.<br />
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br />
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br />
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br />
Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br />
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br />
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br />
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br />
Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br />
Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br />
We trekked and picked until the cans were full,<br />
Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br />
With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br />
Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br />
With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.</p>

<p>We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br />
But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br />
A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br />
The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br />
The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br />
I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br />
That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br />
Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not. </p>

Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas you no longer need. It's about letting go, abdicating from obligation and guilt, being true to the self you are now. Discardia is the time to get rid of things that no longer add value to your life, shed bad habits, let go of emotional baggage and generally lighten your load. - Dinah Sanders
</blockquote>

<p>Discardia was the theme of today's <a href="http://twitter.com/a2b3">a2b3</a> Thursday lunch.</p>

<p>We talked of family emptying years of accumulation as their inheritances, including removing acres of scrap metal from a farm, organizing two day long estate sales, auctioning old books off by the case, and dealing with the environmental impact of 200 old tires.  Some of that meant quite a bit of money and some family bonding time; others of it was stories of incredible hassles.</p>

<p>Balancing that, of course, was the urge to collect, whether it be <a href="http://potifos.com/fraud/">Nigerian fraud email</a>, <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/349434750/in/pool-fairydoors">fairy door drawing from your kids</a>, <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/superpatron">books you've read or would like to read</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/vielmetti/annarbor">web pages about Ann Arbor</a>, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/05/my_quadrille_no.html">handwritten notebooks</a>, <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/">online notebooks</a>, or any of the things in the physical world.  Physical world stuff - tools, two-by-four remnants, scrap metal, pig-themed trinkets, fish-themed trinkets, books, books, more books, paper (sorted or unsorted) take up a lot more space, but the online things occupy your brain too.</p>

<p>What are you doing for discardia?  We've been emptying kitchen cupboards of unused pans - one piece that's on its way out is a broiling pan (Not Much Use In A Vegetarian Household).</p>

<p>More on day lilies from the <a href="http://www.daylilyclub.net/">Southern Michigan Daylily Society</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Some Daylilies are dormant with their foliage dying back completely,
others are evergreens, there is also a wide range in between referred
to as semi-evergreen.   They have tuberous, somewhat fleshy roots
and strap or grass-like leaves that arch gracefully making clumps
attractive even when not in bloom.</p>

<p>Clusters of blooms appear at the top of a mostly leafless stem, known <br />
as a scape, which grows above the foliage. Sometimes there is <br />
branching on the scape allowing for multiple blooms each day. The <br />
Daylily bloom itself is only open for one day hence the name <br />
Hemerocallis, “beautiful for a day”.<br />

Burned all my notebooks 
What good are notebooks

<p>The <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/faq.html#colophon">colophon</a> is worth quoting in full, though you'll need to go to the original to get all of the hyperlinks.</p>

<p><blockquote>
These notebooks began in September 1994 as a set of key-words for Usenet filtering; I don&rsquo;t remember why I started to elaborate them, but I did, and put them online on 3 October 1994. They quickly became a single huge useless file, which a few people, moved by boredom, misplaced pity or Teutonic thoroughness, were kind enough to read. At their urging, on 13 March 1995 I split it into many more or less conveniently sized files, one per subject, ordered by date. (Those still dated 1994 haven&rsquo;t been significantly changed since before then, or if they have, I&rsquo;ve been too lazy to update their date.) That was the last change in format until March 2004, when I moved them into Blosxom, so they could have an RSS feed and a basic search facility (since I&rsquo;m clearly never going to get around to creating, much less maintaining, a genuine index).</p>

<p>The notebooks have been written in Emacs on, successively, 1992-vintage NeXT workstations, a succession of Sun workstations, a second-hand Powerbook Duo named sloth, a much-missed Powerbook G4 named gluttony and, currently, a new Powerbook named wrath. (Note to hardware manufacturers: those could be the names of your products instead, if you give them to me!) Each notebook is a simple HTML file. (The ones containing mathematical symbols are produced using HTMX.) For the first ten years, that was it. Since I started using Blosxom, it's dynamically generated the displayed pages, so that the pages you read are filtered, prettified versions of the ones I write. Index pages are statically generated (using cron every half hour), so they get served faster, and some fiddling with Apache's URL re-writing engine keeps you from seeing the seams. The complete installation uses the following Blosxom plugins: entries_template, file, find, flavourdir, foreshortened, interpolate_conditional, meta, metadate, SmartyPants, storytitle. Danny Yee kindly provided me with a cascading style sheet, and explained how to use it.<br />

Poor Weather Has Cut Size of Most U.S. Fruit Crops</p>

<p>June 19, 2008 - By Dick Lehnert <br />
Managing Editor</p>

<p>Crummy spring weather coast to coast has reduced the production for most fruit crops. The word “record” was used only once – for blueberries – during the 53rd annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate. </p>

<p>The Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association and attended by more than 150 people from across North America, was held June 18 in Grand Rapids, Mich. </p>

<p>Many of the presenters adjusted their PowerPoint presentations as they were making them, reflecting continuing poor weather. New York has hit by a hail storm of “epic proportions” on June 16, and the June drop, delayed and prolonged by cool weather that slowed crop development, was still taking apples and peaches from trees across the northern states. <br />

<p>The hail that pelted Williams' fruit trees marked the latest episode in a series of nature-related setbacks blamed for damaging the region's cherry crop. This year's harvest is shaping up as the worst since the nearly cherry-less summer of 2002, experts said.<br />

Orchards were damaged last week when temperatures dropped as low as the mid-20s, but farms in the northern half of the county – above the 45th Parallel – weren’t hit quite so hard, said Nikki Rothwell, director of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Resource Station.</p>

<p>“I think there is significant damage out there. We can’t put a number on it but we’ve got poor pollination on top of a freeze event,” she said.</p>

<p>Apples were hit hardest by early morning cold May 28, followed by sweet cherries and then tarts and other crops growing in moderate to poor sites, or in a valley or pocket more susceptible to cold weather, she said.<br />

<p>If you look closely at this personnel record, it's eerily reminscent of the data structure of a LinkedIn record.  Note that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/18/digitalmedia.mediabusiness2">LinkedIn just sold off a 5% slice for $53 million</a>, giving them a nominal valuation of $1 billion; with 23 million membership records, that's about $40 per punchcard.</p>

<p>Kevin Kelly (re)discovered these cards recently and has a nice set with photos in his piece <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/one_dead_media.php">One Dead Media</a>, noticing that nothing of this description was anything he could find anywhere:</p>

<blockquote>
But prescient as it was, and as cool as these cards were, I searched the Net today for any sign of InDecks and was surprised to find no sellers on eBay, no fan sites, no collector sites, no historical web pages, and no evidence that anyone is still using them.  They are gone. Blasted out by the first computers. Bruce Sterling lists them in his Dead Media file, a catalog of defunct media devices and platforms.  They seem to be verifiably extinct.

<p>Believing that nothing really goes extinct, I challenge you to reinvent these in some useful, usable way.</p>

<p>The great pop vs. soda controversy is a project that Alan McConchie did to survey regional use of generic names for soft drinks.  You'll see here clearly that Michigan is a "pop" state; the sharp Wisconsin vs. Upper Peninsula divide of soda vs. pop is notable.  You have to do pretty far south into Indiana to see "coke" as the generic.</p>

<p>Matthew Campbell from East Central University (Oklahoma) took this data set and organized it on county boundaries.  Again Wisconsin vs. UP is clear on the soda/pop scale.  I'll attribute that to a difference in state law: it's "pop" if you have to pay a 10 cent deposit on the can, and "soda" if you don't.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year around this time (June 17) the juneberry trees in the streets of Ann Arbor are ripe. </p>

<p>Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you're from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy.  They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you're walking down the street.   If you have lots and lots of these berries (also called saskatoons), you can make a pie out of them - make a two crust pie, with a filling of 3.5 cups juneberries to 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 Tbs of flour.    Here's a video from <a href="http://wildfoodplants.com/article/113/aunt-marilyns-juneberry-pie">Wild Food Plants</a> about Aunt Marilyn's Juneberry Pie.  You can also dry them and use them like dried blueberries - if you get any of them home, or you can pound them with buffalo meat (from your favorite local supplier of buffalo meat) and make pemmican.  </p>

<p>In addition, if you have surplus juneberries *and* surplus grasshoppers, and a taste for them both, there's a traditional Utah Indian recipe for "grasshopper fruitcake":</p>

<blockquote>
Edwin Bryant15 (circa 1848) provided one of the few assessments of grasshopper palatability by a white. following an encounter with Utah Indians, an occasion when three women appeared, "bringing baskets containing a substance, which, upon examination, we ascertained to be service-berries, crushed to a jam and mixed with pulverized grasshoppers. This composition being dried in the sun until it becomes hard, is what may be called the 'fruitcake' of these poor children of the desert. No doubt these women regarded it as one of the most acceptable offerings they could make to us. We purchased all they brought with them, paying them in darning needles and other small articles, with which they were much pleased. The prejudice against the grasshopper 'fruitcake' was strong at first, but it soon wore off, and none of the delicacy was thrown away or lost .... After being killed, they [the grasshoppers] are baked before the fire or dried in the sun, and then pulverized between smooth stones. Prejudice aside, I have tasted what are called delicacies, less agree able to the palate." 
</blockquote>

<p>The secret to juneberry picking in Ann Arbor is to know that you can have a big pile of delicious berries simply by walking across town in such a way that you hit a series of trees in order, no need to backtrack.  Here's the juneberry tour:</p>

<p>Start at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Zingerman's">Zingerman's Deli</a> on Detroit St.  If you can't find it, ask a native, they'll be glad to direct you there, they're used to it.  The juneberry trees are around the side on Kingsley St.  Stop inside, ask if they have any <a href="http://www.zingermans.com/Search.aspx?kw=juneberry">juneberry jam</a> for sale, furrow your brow disappointedly if they don't, taste something else thoughfully, then head out the front and pick more from a tree on Detroit St.</p>

<p>Keep heading up Detroit St and cross over to <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Farmers_Market">Farmer's Market</a>, open Weds. and Sat.  Look around the stalls, ask the farmers nicely if their juneberry crop is good this year, furrow your brow when they say they won't have any at market, admire the solar panels, pick up from spinach from Shannon, and then walk towards the Ann Arbor Observer on Catherine St.  You'll find more berries on the side of that building, they are a bit shaded so they ripen later.  Pick a small box full, head back to market, put a price tag on it, sell it - PROFIT!</p>

<p>Cross back toward Fifth Avenue, head over Huron St and towards the Bank of Ann Arbor.  With your newfound gains make a deposit, but only after you do your harvest from the trees in front of the bank.</p>

<p>Keep heading south on Fifth heading towards the <a href="http://www.aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a>, but stop before you get there at the Library Lot parking lot and admire the prolific trees there.  Consider whether the <A href="http://arborupdate.com/article/1660/downtown-library-project-discussion">downtown library project</a> plans for that surface lot which call for a structure to be built on that lot preserve the fruiting trees which are so characteristic of historical Ann Arbor.</p>

<p>Head into the library, and start figuring out how you are going to preserve those berries for the winter.  Check the <a href="http://www.aadl.org/sopac/tag/juneberry">juneberry</a> tag in the catalog; if you don't find anything, go to the MEL inter-library loan, <a href="http://elibrary.mel.org/search/X?%28juneberry%29&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&backlink=http://www.aadl.org/cat/seek/search/X?(juneberry)&Da=&Db=&SORT=D&topformsub=1">search for Juneberry</a>, and end up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Juneberry-tree-French-writers-Canada/dp/0887721583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213754418&sr=8-1">Jacque Ferron's</a> "The Juneberry Tree".  Sit and eat your berries until it arrives.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>Theories of networked individualism and forms of urban alienation challenge the continued purpose and relevance of conventional community tools in urban neighbourhood. However, the majority of urban residents surveyed in this research still believe that there are people living in their immediate neighbourhood who may share their interests or who are at least personally compatible, but they do not know them. Web-based community networking systems have the potential to facilitate intra-neighbourhood interaction and support community building efforts. Community networking studies have shown that technical connectivity alone does not ensure community, and that new and weak communities do not benefit from community networking systems as much as existing and strong communities do. This paper builds on these findings to present a methodology combining principles of Participation, Animation and Design (PAD). It is currently being employed and tested in a master-planned inner-city residential development. PAD builds on intrinsic motivation in residents to find out about and meet one another in a private and inobtrusive way. It encourages residents to take social ownership of the community building process and the community network. PAD recognises the network qualities in the communicative ecology of urban residents and supplements collective approaches towards community building with personalised networking strategies.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>I went strawberry picking with the boys on Father's Day at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rowes">Rowe's Produce Farm</a> in <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Rawsonville">Rawsonville</a>, about a mile s. of the Rawsonville Road exit between <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ypsilanti">Ypsilanti</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Belleville</a>Belleville</a>.  It was a hot day with a bright sun, the berries were ripe but not overripe, and we picked an 8 qt tray in no time at all.</p>

<p>Afterwards I washed and picked over the berries (a 3 y/o, no matter how enthusiastic, is not a perfect judge of ripeness or berry quality).  We froze 3 qts whole on a cookie sheet, and the rest were used for strawberry shortcake w/fresh whipping cream delivered from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Calder_Dairy">Calder Dairy</a>.  Mmmm.</p>

<p>Some notes to self for next year:</p>

<p>Bring more water!  Picking in the hot sun is hot, and you get dried out fast.  I should have had a gallon with me.</p>

<p>Make sure you have sunglasses and a good hat!  I felt pretty sun-bleached afterwards.</p>

<p>Go out as early as you can, so it's not so hot and the sun is not so bright.</p>

<p>We made a field trip to the <A href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/otisvillecem.html">Otisville Cemetery</a> south of Belleville, where I have some ancestors buried - there's a story to that settlement that I haven't figured out yet, it's a pleasant but nondescript spot in a rural area with graves from the 1840s-1900s.  Some bits of family history are in the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/histmich/belleville.html">Carpenter-Hope</a> section of a Belleville city history.<br />
<blockquote><br />
CARPENTER-HOPE <br />
<b>John and Lucy Carpenter</b>, one of Van Buren's pioneering family raised a family of four girls one their farm land on Martinsville Road. Their daughter, Angeline M. married to Richard Hope and moved into a home located at 187 Main Street in Belleville. Daughter, Matilda, married Jenx Pullen and moved into a home located on Martinsville Road. <b>Mary Jane</b> married <b>Woodbury Clark</b>, and lived in one of the Clark residences. Lucy married George Quirk. A descendant of the Hope family , named Margaret later wrote that the property located at 187 Main Street, was the site of the 1886 Soldiers and Sailors Encampment. <br />
Margaret Hope was born April 9, 1876, the daughter of Richard and Angeline (Carpenter) Hope. Her father, Richard was born in Detroit in 1844 and came to Belleville with his parents, John and Joanne (Winkleman) Hope, sometime in the 1850's. John Hope served as Treasurer in 1859 and Justice of the Peace in 1868. By 1875 he had changed his occupation from blacksmith to cobbling boots and shoes. <br />
Richard Hope built his home at 187 Main Street about 1880. He and his wife, Angeline had previously resided in a backhouse behind the home of William Warren. Richard worked as a drover, a livestock buyer, and was the proprietor of a meat market. He later owned a second farm on Sumpter Road and served as Belleville's Drain Commissioner in 1894/95. <br />
Richard Hope died on November 19, 1901 at that age of 57, killed at the Wabash RailRoad crossing on Sumpter Road, as he traveled to his farm. He and his wife had, had 2 children, Louis, who later moved to Texas and married, where he had a son named, Stewart. When Louis passed away, his son, Stewart came back to Belleville and was raised by Margaret Hope. <br />
Margaret, moved with her parents to their home at 374 Main Street when she was 4 years old. She worked in many local community occupations such as teacher and secretary for Henry Van Schoick Harness, Carriage, and Hardware business. She also worked at the Peoples Bank of Belleville. She also had a lifelong committment to the Belleville Grange, a local farmers group, where she worked as its secretary from 1906 to 1955. Margaret passed away in September of 1955.<br />

At a previous employer's previous location, my office was on a street (Depot St) regularly used to speed through town.  Every day people would zoom to and from the hospital, and every day the AAPD would stop some fraction of them to give them tickets.  I was glad for it too - to cross Depot when cars are barreling along at 45 in a 30 zone was not fun.  Slow down already.<br />
