<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-01-laptop-backpack/">Laptop backpacks - summary of recommendations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I recently sent out an email query to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> mailing list about backpacks suitable for laptops.&nbsp; In the interests of not keeping useful information in my inbox, here's a summary of sorts.</p>

<p>The list, in no particular order, with some amount of incomplete information:</p>

<p>Land's End: the pack I have has a label, don't know the name of it in their catalog.&nbsp; It's nice.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.landsend.com/outfits/backpacks/index.html">Land's End backpack page</a> has more.</p>

<p>North Face: the Yavapai, &quot;carries not only my laptop but a change of clothes when I get to work by bike.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Industries: &quot;really like it. However, when I graduated from a MacBook to a Pro, the notebook was a bit too large, so definitely try inserting the notebook before purchasing.&quot;</p>

<p>Patagonia: Lightwire backpack &quot;a great deal&quot; right now at least <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/product/product_focus.jsp?OPTION=PRODUCT_FOCUS_DISPLAY_HANDLER&amp;style_color=48860-683&amp;ws=true&amp;catcode=WS.WEB_SPECIALS&amp;refferer=WSL">on sale now</a></p>

<p>Tom Bihn: &quot;As someone who has carried my laptop in it everywhere for the last 10 years, I highly recommend&quot; the <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0104">Brain Bag</a>.</p>

<p>Spire USA: &quot;I've been carrying a messenger vert bag from <a href="http://spireusa.com">Spire USA</a> for 9 years.&nbsp; Others in my family use the backpacks and love them as much as I love my bag.&nbsp; Their bags have had good attention to detail for people connected to their laptops.&quot;</p>

<p>Office Depot / Staples: &quot;For the budget minded I found the laptop backpacks at Office Depot/Staples to be very sufficient&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbpbags.com/hamptons_collection.html">BBP:</a> &quot;It's innovative, big, and while it's always in backpack mode - it still kinda looks like a messenger bag - which to my way of thinking makes it a 1/2 step more acceptable in the rare more formal meeting.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timbuk2.com">Timbuk 2</a>: &quot;I am using a Timbuk2 Messenger Bag that I got from Bivouac a few years ago.&nbsp; Great bag, and I think it will outlive ME!&quot;</p>

<p>Timbuk2 again: I have the Timbuk2 Underground. It's incredible spacious - I carry my MBP, DSLR + 2 lenses, several books in the main compartment. And then there are the 2 side pockets that carry numerous other gadgets, GPS, power cord, etc.</p>

<p>Franklin Covey: <a href="http://shopping.franklincovey.com/shopping/catalog/productaccessories.jsp?navAction=push&amp;navCount=0&amp;crc=cat129&amp;id=prod1710026&amp;skuid=32361">Victorinox</a>: &quot;This spring I finally found a backpack I am happy with.&nbsp; It is the world's greatest compter backpack.&nbsp; It can easily allow you to travel with two computers and accessories, or with just one computer and all your travel needs for a night or two.&nbsp; It shows no signs of wear after four months, but whenever it does fall apart, it will be the first time I ever happily buy the same model twice in a row.&nbsp; Oh, and did I mention that it costs less than $80?&quot;</p>

<p>Deuter: &quot;I have a Deuter that I bought at Bivouac several years ago. I bought the one that was called something like &quot;mega office&quot; or &quot;giga office&quot;. It's less daypack-y and more laptop-and-pens-n-stuff-hold-y than most of what Bivouac sells. It's been great - nice features, has aged well.&quot;</p>

<p>LL Bean: &quot;I love my LL Bean backpack. My mom got it for me when I was a senior in college (1993-94). It<br />
lived through that year, law school, marriage, our honeymoon (it was my carry-on), teacher certification classes, two teaching jobs, and it is still happy to ride on my back when I ride my bike. I love that bag&quot;</p>

<p>Brenthaven: &quot;I couldn't be a bigger fan of Brenthaven backpacks. I've had one of
their models for probably 8 years and it still looks brand new and is
amazingly well laid out. They are a bit spendy but I see no signs that
this thing will ever wear out.&quot;</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">management metrics: &#34;queue depth days&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In the manage by numbers world...</p>

<p>One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress.  At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.</p>

<p>If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time.   End the day with 100 unanswered messages 100 days in a row, and your queue-depth-day is 10000 (eek).</p>

<p>There are of course three ways to attack this problem (at least, but bear with me)</p>

<p>1.  Reduce the size of the current queue, so that there's less to deal with right now;<br />
2.  Reduce the influx into the queue, so that there's less to deal with every day;<br />
3.  Increase the speed at which things are removed from the queue, so they don't stay so long.</p>

<p>The inbox zero mantra pulls from all of these, but you really need to understand the impact of all three to attack this.  One time heroic measures to empty the inbox are necessary, because you can't create a bunch of lasting improvement if there's a big overhang of undone work nagging at you.  Slowing down flows inbound helps reduce the rate of queue depth growth, but doesn't clear the queue.  And working faster to acknowledge email just creates more email!</p>

<p>Classic solutions to this whole system is to move communications out of queued systems into either real time systems (IM, chat, voice) or into asynchronous multiplayer games (blogs, wikis).  The hard core communications people completely shut down their email system and go entirely to the other extremes; the other hard core communications people treat their email inbox AS IF IT WERE IM and always answer and file everything instantly.</p>

<p>The queue depth could be anything, really; it could be outstanding phone calls to make, emails to answer, people standing in line in your retail operation, customers waiting impatiently for a call back to solve their time critical problem, or forms needing to be filled out.  Just know that in any system where you can get stuff coming in faster than you can get rid of it queues will form, and at worst they back up to the point where other people can see that you're not on top of everything.</p>

<blockquote><br />
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).<br />

<blockquote><br />
We've all been there, that sickening feeling as you reach for your back pocket, only to find your wallet gone. A frantic search turns up nothing. You feel sad. But you wouldn't feel that sad if you had photocopied the contents of your wallet. Then you would have a legal copy of your license to use until it got replaced, and all your account numbers and the phone numbers you need to call for replacements. So take a second this weekend to pop your wallet into the photocopy or scanner and keep the paper in a safe place. You might be very glad some day that you did.<br />

<p><a href="http://blog.iliumsoft.com/?p=75">Photocopy your wallet - no?</a> (Ellen Craw, Ilium Software)<br />
<blockquote><br />
I really hate it when people suggest photocopying your wallet contents for extra safety. Call me crazy (many people do) and paranoid (there’s some truth to that as well), but a photocopier is nothing but a scanner plus a printer. There’s no guarantee that your info is cleared out as soon as the pages are printed. If it’s your own copier in your own home office, fine, but if you take your wallet to Kinkos or CopyMax or any commercial place, keep in mind that what you’re doing is using their scanner to scan all the numbers you’re carefully protecting other places.<br />

<blockquote><br />
1) Make a backup. Years ago, someone suggested that I put a scan of my critical documents up on the Internet where I could always access them from anywhere. So I scanned my passport, driver's license, and birth certificate in a password-protected file that I mailed to a supplemental Yahoo account. It was easy to just download and print it to have all of the information and documentation that the embassy required.<br />

Real quick, David Linthicum has a cool post on the move in the market from human-oriented SaaS (Software as a Service) to systems oriented SaaS--perhaps better named "Service as a Service". The naming is a little nerdy, but David is right on about this being an ultimate goal of the SaaS market, as well as of cloud computing in general.<br />

<p>chase that reference to this <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/03/when_saas_means.html">Intelligent Enterprise article on When SaaS Means 'Services as a Service' </a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
StrikeIron is the one that comes to mind. StrikeIron is not a SaaS provider, but a SaaS provider with the first S being 'Services' vs. 'Software.' They offer a variety of services, such as SMS text messaging, tax rate calculations, address validation, etc. The objective being not to provide the holistic application, but simple components that can be abstracted into enterprise and SaaS applications, as needed, for a small monthly subscription fee. Thus, you don't write it, you don't test it, you don't host it, you just leverage its functionality at a fraction of the cost if you developed the same service in-house.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>hm, perhaps a little bit too "granular" (oh I love to hate that word; coarse, Demera, what are you talking, sugar?).  Another try goes down the manufacturing route - envisioning cheap frictionless production of one-off quantities of things, in this case printed letters sent through the mail.  The <a href="http://blog.postful.com/2007/10/29/manufacturing-as-a-service-maas/">Postful blog on Manufacturing as a Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The modern service cloud ushers in a fundamental shift in our accounting of economic costs. The endemic overhead in even the most basic of deals and transactions is perhaps the key factor in determining the structure of our economic systems at all scales. The service cloud can reduce those transaction costs to negligible levels.
</blockquote>

<p>and finally perhaps this one from <a href="http://jrsays.com/2007/09/software-as-service-objectification-of.html">JR Says on the objectification of business processes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I know the term “Service-as-a-service” sounds like an idiotic reference to nothing, but my point is that business services can finally be delivered in a way which is easily acquirable by customers, as true services, with:
- clear, non-obtrusive contracts (the business kind… you know, ToS you feel no obligation to read ;)
- clear communication contracts (the implementation kind… “you give us A , we give you B”)
- pay as you go – with clear pricing
- strong support (imagine that)
</blockquote>

<p>I went to Cuil (gaelic for "fail") for the last word; it's a good one.  Via <a href="http://www.cubiccompass.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,794ab498-c692-4eb4-b3c7-b02c9e0917e2.aspx">Cubic Compass</a>, quoting <a href="http://www.tcg-advisors.com/who/lay.htm">Philip Lay</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"What is likely to no longer work is the conventional time and materials model of expensive "manual" services, now seen to be highly inefficient unless enabled by increasing use of automation.  What must be made to work is to have virtually every service substantially automated and deliverable online once the service in question has been transformed from a custom, never-done-before, thing to a repeatable and relatively routine activity."

      </h3>
      <p>I've typed some things about bug camp, but haven't blogged about it.</p>

<p>The name of the place is not really bug camp; it's the <a href="http://www.pagecenter.org/">Page Center</a> in Little Lake, MI:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Our peaceful, natural setting on Little Lake is the perfect place for your next retreat, reunion, wedding, reception or workshop. Located 3 miles East of M-35/553, approximately 24 miles south of Marquette.<br />
</blockquote><br />
It's a nice spot, a former church camp, with a lovely main house, a dining hall and kitchen, and eight bunk cabins.  We had 25 there for a family reunion and everything worked out well.</p>

<p>There are bugs there - quite a few dragon flies, one alder beetle that had a nickname ("Mango"), and a bunch of little non-biting flies that swarmed the night time lights.  As bugs go very tame, no ticks, no black flies, no deer flies, no horse flies, no sand flies (I could go on and on with biting insects that weren't there).  The woods had blueberries (not yet ripe) and wintergreen.</p>

<p>Little Lake is just outside of Gwinn, and we were there for the 4th of July (amazing parade).  I went into town with my older son one afternoon and we hung out at the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2007/01/forsyth_townshi.html">Forsyth Township Public Library</a> for a while and shopped at the Gwinn St. Vincent de Paul store (easily the biggest store in town).</p>

<p>I owe a certain special someone a night in a swanky hotel in exchange for all of the bugs - but it really was nice.</p>

<p>(There is another "bug camp" - the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs/">U of Michigan Bio Station in Pellston</a> has the same nickname and some of the same bugs and general camp architecture.)</p>

<p>(Here's the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/a_field_guide_t.html">2003 blueberry picking report</a> with several locations near the Page Center mentioned.)</p>

<p>There's lots of pictures, and lots of comments on the pictures, including this one from "jrgoflo":</p>

I loved these pictures. There's really nothing better than Wild Michigan blueberries. My favorite place to pick them is at the Shelldrake Dam State Forest Campground NW of Paradise in the U.P. or the Betsy Lake area of Tahquamenon Falls State Park. I've just planted 10 lowbush blueberry shrubs at my house. Can't wait!!

<blockquote>
The book <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/2908575">Plenty</a> is about a young Vancouver couple, Alisa Smith and J.B. Mackinnon. The two decide to live on locally grown foods for a year. I've just read to the section on blueberries where they find a patch of beautiful, fat juicy ones only to discover that they are being grown for a local Buddhist temple and are not for sale. I don't know, yet, if they talk their way into a sale. Given how personable the couple is, my guess is probably. Putting the book down to attend to chores, I've realized that Smith and Mackinnon have convinced me to seriously consider following their eat-local example.
</blockquote>

<p>I'll note that the LibraryThing tag cloud for this book includes the tag "read and returned" (!)</p>

<p>Here's a recipe from that article:</p>

<h3>Buddha's Blueberry Bread Pudding</h3>

<p>4 cups of just about any kind (maybe not dark rye) of bread chunks, an inch or two in size, mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter or canola oil</p>

<p>2-3 cups of blueberries (You can decide how much you can bear to cook as opposed to eat raw.)</p>

<p>3 eggs</p>

<p>2 tsp. of ground cinnamon</p>

<p>1 1/2 cups of almost hot water</p>

<p>1 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk (The condensed part matters.)</p>

<p>1/4 cup of melted butter or oil</p>

<p>3 teaspoons of vanilla</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the bread chunks into a greased, 9-inch baking pan. Square works best, but whatever you have will probably work. Sometimes I use two bread baking pans. Sprinkle the berries over the bread.</p>

<p>In a big bowl, stir up the eggs, then add all the other remaining ingredients. Stir for a minute or two and then pour the mixture over the bread and blueberries. Bake about 45 minutes or until a knife stuck into the center comes out clean or mostly clean.</p>

<p>Try not to eat the pudding straight out of the oven because it will burn the top of your mouth. If you do anyway, your mouth will feel much better by tomorrow.</p>

      <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS</p>

<p>By John Clark</p>

<p>My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I raked blueberries for several years, never getting particularly skillful at it, but earning enough to buy my school clothes and supplies every fall. Along the way, I discovered the itchy and painful bite of brown field spiders and that not all hornets nest in trees. I even watched, bemused as a dozen teenagers ran whooping and hollering after a curious bear that had followed our truck down a woods road from a remote blueberry field.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's fruit season (or nearly so) and so it's time to start thinking about what we're going to do for making holiday gifts.  One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy.</p>

<p>We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it.</p>

<p>Some minimal collection of things to help for this year, one fruit at a time; not exhaustive, but maybe it will help jump start next year.  Ordered in rough order of appearance of the fruit here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strawberry liqueur.  <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=750">Irene's Strawberry liqueur</a> from The Cottage Smallholder; noting that "There’s nothing like the distraction of homemade grog when times are getting tough."
<li>Juneberry liqueur.  <a href="http://forums.farm-garden.com/viewtopic.php?id=1056">Saskatoons go with gin</a>, says contributor "prairiemaid" from Manitoba.
<li>Gooseberry liqueur.  In the 1930s, <a href="http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/GuidesToCollections/MeltisofBedford.aspx">Meltis of Bedford</a> introduced a gooseberry liqueur sweet to the UK market which was a big success, so they say.    Read Anton Chekov's <a href="http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html">Gooseberries</a>.  I don't have a recipe.
<li>Currants.  Make cassis; here's a <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/labruscagrape/2005-June/000296.html">cassis recipe</a>, from " The Cook and the Gardener" by Amanda Hesser, A Year of Recipes and Writings from the French Countryside.
<li>Blueberries.  Freeze the berries first, then make <a href="http://www.guntheranderson.com/liqueurs/blueber0.htm">blueberry liqueur.</a>.  Ex-Michigander <a href="http://culinariaeugenius.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/my-staples-summer-blueberry-liqueur/">Culinaria Eugenius</a> has a photo of the red-purple liquid that results.

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://onewebday.org/">One Web Day is September 22</a>; University of Michigan Law professor <a href="http://scrawford.net/blog/">Susan Crawford</a> is organizing it, with events and participation from around the world.  It's "Earth Day for the Internet".</p>

<blockquote>
Around the world, we're focusing attention on the importance of the internet to political participation -
that's this year's theme.  We're also encouraging people to talk about (and do something about) internet issues they're worried about - censorship, the digital divide, inadequate connectivity generally.  The idea behind OneWebDay is to create a platform for a global constituency that cares about the future of the internet. 
</blockquote>

<p>The piece of this that I have an abiding interest in is access to the Internet in public places; the development of business practices, community efforts, and municipal and library systems that provide some level of public computing and communications infrastructure that is not tied to a monthly fee from an Internet service provider.</p>

<p>There's a large number of businesses, usually cafes and restaurants but also laundromats, supermarkets, and ice cream shops, where the proprietors can see a narrow self-interest in providing free network access to anyone who brings a computer and buys their daily aliquot of caffeine or sugar.   This is an essential part of civic information infrastructure, because rather than being planned centrally by some committee, it just happens.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, the free access comes with strings, most notably in my experience the existence of badly designed or configured firewalls that block access to perfectly reasonable web sites or tools.  This failure is a market failure if there are enough alternatives - you walk down the street to the next cafe if it bugs you enough - but you can only route around censorship if you have an alternative.   If the web access is really bad, I just don't go back.</p>

<p>Centrally planned civic internets have been a failure around Ann Arbor; the much-ballyhooed Wireless Washtenaw has never developed either enough critical mass or enough ubiquity of coverage to justify its fees for service.  Despite an advisory board that included every township supervisor who wanted to be part of it, it's not part of the answer to universal free web access.  In contrast, the privately funded Wireless Ypsi, which uses Meraki hardware in a mesh configuration, has hit enough of the business districts of Ypsilanti to make internet ubiquitous there, without the need for anything more than some effort and coordinating about how it's done.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>If you have enough density of people online, networks start to get used for political participation and political action.  Ann Arbor has been online in one form or another since Bob Parnes's CONFER and Marcus Watts's Picospan of the 1970s, so we have some experience with this, and elected officials who have been on the net as long as there has been a net to be on.</p>

<p>If all politics is local, then there is nothing more political than the local neighborhood mailing list, the group of 15-50 individuals in close proximity who all hear the same loud construction noise or see the same contractor getting hassled by the city and can mobilize in a density and coordination of action that gets attention and results.  Here the universal access level that gets things done depends on older, lower tech, pre web coordination tools - the individual who has that email list and who can write the call to action to get attention or get things done.  In all cases I've seen that work people reuse and repurpose existing free or ad-supported tools to manage these.</p>

<p>Every so often, issues leave the neighborhood level and appear in public.  If you are lucky, you have a great newspaper, but great newspapers are hard to come by.  Even without a great print newspaper, it's entirely possible to have a really good civic news site, one which is resourceful enough to post city council meeting agendas and to get city council members to post under their own names, or one that sustains a distinctive perspective on town long enough to generate meetings which are offline and not just online.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>With this context in place, I see the digital divide as an opportunity.</p>

<p>Calling it a digital divide simply emphasizes that there is a divide - that the neighborhood of West Willow is different from the village of Manchester, and that there may not be much reason for those two groups of people to work together for collective action without some external impetus that seeks to weave them together.</p>

<p>In every community and economy there are holes, opportunities unrealized because people just don't know that what they are looking for is there.  The analog divide is even larger than the digital divide, and maybe (just maybe) when we realize that we can start to build practices that address that.</p>

<p>It's just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.</p>

<p>There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor.  The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm.  <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/07/dexter-blueberr.html">Last year they charged $1.35 per pound for U-Pick</a>, and it was easy to fill a five pound bucket in a single session.</p>

<p>Note that the Main Street Bridge through Dexter is closed to eastbound traffic, so if you are heading back to Ann Arbor you'll go around downtown Dexter.  See the <a href="http://www.villageofdexter.org/">Village of Dexter web site</a> for details and a construction webcam.</p>

<p>Slightly farther away is <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/The_Blueberry_Patch">The Blueberry Patch</a> in Grass Lake, just east of Jackson.  The berries are organic, and they use nets to keep away the birds.</p>

<p>The other part of the state where I know a bit of detail is in the southwestern corner (known as Michiana) near New Buffalo, MI, Michigan City IN and the surrounding area.  I scanned in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/1225078024/">list of Michiana blueberry picking farms</a> when we were there last year, and that info should still be good.  It's the closest Michigan berrypicking you'll get if you're coming from Chicagoland.</p>

<p>Leduc Blueberries near Kalamazoo has <a href="http://www.leducblueberries.com/extra.iml">a collection of eight years worth of annual blueberry recipes</a> (PDF), which include the usual bakes, crumbles, pies and the like plus a series of dinner salads like a <a href="http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&controller=article&category_id=157&article=18460">blueberry lemon chicken salad</a>.</p>

<p>Other blueberry crop news:</p>

<p>A report from Hammonton, New Jersey predicts an <a href="http://www.thehammontonnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/LIFESTYLE/806250307/1024/NEWS17">average New Jersey blueberry crop for 2008</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
"The hot weather that we've been having has had some effects on the ripening and harvesting of our products, though the cooler-than-normal ground temperatures and, until recently, cool overnight temperatures have helped to somewhat mitigate the day heat," said William Walker of the New Jersey Department Agriculture's Jersey Fresh program. "The season was slow to begin, but we're now on a normal production schedule."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>DeGrandchamp Farms predicts a good 2008 season:<br />
<blockquote><br />
As I write this article, the 2008 blueberry crop looks like it has the potential to be an excellent one. I believe a lot has to do with the excellent growing season last summer which produced good growth and bud set. </p>

<p>Wholesale prices for the fresh market were strong last year and should continue for the 2008 season. Demand for blueberries is strong for the processing market as more manufacturers are using blueberries in their product lines. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CropValuSu/CropValuSu-02-14-2008.txt">USDA crop price report</a> for the last three years for blueberries:<br/>
2005: $1.44/lb<br />
2006: $1.76/lb        <br />
2007: $1.83/lb </p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/ready-to-pick-michigan-blueberries/">Absolute Michigan has a Ready To Pick feature on blueberries</a> with recipes and crop and grower info.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for in comments:</p>

<p>Have you gone blueberry picking recently, and how was it?<br />
Where do you go wild (not cultivated) berry picking - if not precisely where, then at least the township?<br />
What do you know about mechanical blueberry harvesters?<br />
Have you ever used a blueberry rake, and is it easy to make one out of ordinary materials by hand?<br />
What are your favorite blueberry recipes?<br />
How do you preserve blueberries for February in Michigan when it's gray all the time?<br />
What varieties of blueberry are good for growing in your yard, and what soil do you need?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while, you run across something so wonderful you have to share.</p>

<p>I have been tracking hits to the Google search <a href="http://google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders">Michigan spiders</a>, ever since an odd combination of page text about automated web browsing tools unearthed a bunch of folks trying to identify the spiders crawling across their day lilies.</p>

<p>Today's search logs turned up this amazing resource, the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">The Backyard Arthropod Project<br />
A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>.  The author writes:<br />
<blockquote><br />
This started out as a typical ranting blog over on Livejournal, but it turns out that, overall, I’m a happy sort of guy and don’t really have that many things to rant about. As of February 2007, it has instead turned into a project to document every arthropod that I can find on our property (about 9 acres on the north slope of Old Mill Hill in the Keeweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan). This includes insects, spiders, other arachnids, crustaceans, and pretty much anything I find with an exoskeleton. There should be at least one new arthropod every week, for as long as the variety holds out (which could be years). I’ll also randomly inject whatever thoughts happen to occur to me at the time, although I’ll try to stick with at least some connection to the topic at hand. When I run out of arthropods, maybe I’ll start in on the plants.</p>

<p>While I have always been interested in insects and other arthropods, I unfortunately have zero formal training in entomology (I am an extractive metallurgist by profession), so I’m basically trying to learn arthropod taxonomy as I go. I will doubtless make many mistakes, please don’t hesitate to correct me when I am wrong.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Go, look.  There are pictures, there are bugs - arachnids, isopods, diptera, cutworm moths, crickets, katydids.  There are tags: <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-house/">found in house</a> and <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-yard/">found in yard</a> stand in equal prominence.  9 acres in the UP yields plenty of bugs, in season, and season is year-round, as the presence of the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/2008/01/19/snow-fly/">snow fly - Chionea valga</a> will attest.</p>

<p>This is why people live in the UP!  Bugs, all with Latin names!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-26-kilowatts-per-t/">kilowatts per terabyte, or terabytes per kilowatt: a measure of storage energy efficiency</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A measure of the efficiency of data storage; the equivalent would be W/GB (watts per gigabyte).</p>

<p>The range measured below is 0.4 TB/KW (RAM) to 500 TB/KW (Blu-ray disks), with a corresponding range in access speed and update times.</p>

<p>Some estimates or measures:</p>

<p>If you are using solid state memory (no disk; just memory, configured as disk) from <a href="http://www.superssd.com/products/tera-ramsan/">Texas Memory Systems</a>, expect to have 2.5 KW/TB, or 0.4 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The Tera-RamSan incorporates specially designed 4-Gbit Fibre Channel or 4x InfiniBand interfaces that include performance-enhancing hardware to reduce I/O latency to under 14 microseconds. With I/O requests being served so quickly, an order-of-magnitude more requests per second are executed by a single Tera-RamSan interface as compared to other Fibre Channel interfaces. By scaling SSD modules up to 8 units (8 Fibre Channel links per unit or 4 InfiniBand links per unit), the Tera-RamSan is the ultimate storage solution for high-performance applications in total IOPS and total bandwidth. Also, because the Tera-RamSan is DDRRAM based, there is NO penalty for RANDOM accesses. Data requests need not be tuned for performance. User access time is not compromised, even if tens of thousands of users access the system simultaneously. Extreme performance is the key feature of the Tera-RamSan.  <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html">From 2005, Pierre Devries: including cooling</a> about 1 KW/TB, or 1 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Working off Barroso, Dean and Hölzle’s paper on the Google cluster architecture, I infer that the energy consumption for storage is approximately 1W/GB: a dual 1.4-GHz Intel Pentium III server with a two 80GB drives draws 120W per server. Adding Google’s estimate of about 40% for cooling, gives 165 W per 160 GB, or 1 W/GB (watt/gigabyte). <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>in the <a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html?showComment=1120610880000#c112061093215420698">comments to that post</a>, using the archive.org architecture: 50W/TB, or 20 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Capricorn tech clains that their Petabox storage, which they built for archive.org, runs as little as 50W/TB. I don't think that number includes the power consumption of the required air conditioning.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>updating <a href="http://www.capricorn-tech.com/products.php">Capricorn's Petabox to the current (2008) web site</a>, we see 27W/TB, or 37 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The PetaBox is completely scalable, from individual terabyte nodes to petabyte clusters. A single 19-inch rack can support up to 120TB of raw disk space. This density is achieved through an economy of design that consumes as little as 27 watts per terabyte.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/03/23/222467/solving-storage-power-and-cooling-concerns.htm">Computer Weekly in 2007</a> talks about metrics but doesn't actually measure:<br />
<blockquote><br />
An individual drive uses 5W to 15W of power depending on its capacity, rotation speed, form factor and operating state, but "you can't just multiply the number of drives in an array by some average power rating to get a total," says Mark Greenlaw, senior director with storage marketing at EMC. The power consumption of the array is more than the sum of the power used by the individual drives. Controllers and other components consume power. Copan Systems proposes two metrics for archival data storage: storage density measured in terabytes per square foot and terabytes per kilowatt.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.copansystems.com/news/press_releases.php?press_id=64">A COPAN Systems press release from 2007</a>; naturally, take press releases for what they are worth.  The range from 4 TB/KW (Fibre Channel), 17 TB/KW (SATA), and 100 TB/KW (COPAN's sooper stuffs):<br />
<blockquote><br />
COPAN Systems has taken a "revolutionary" approach in how it has engineered its products over the past 4 years to deal with power and cooling issues in the data center. The low power requirements of COPAN's enhanced MAID architecture integrated with the extremely large storage density delivers in excess of an impressive 100 terabyte (TB) per kilowatt, the highest in the industry. This compares to an average power density for Fibre Channel disk products of approximately 4 TB per kilowatt and an average rate for standard SATA disk products of 17 TB per kilowatt. The savings are significant with estimates for power and cooling savings between $5.7 million and $7.8 million over a four year time period.<br />
</blockquote><br />
MAID, or "massive array of idle disks", if you don't know it, is an architecture where the drives are usually powered down; you wouldn't use it for active hot storage, but for mostly offline stuff it's a possible solution.</p>

<p>For the weird, here's a read-mostly solution: a <a href="http://powerfile.com/">Powerfile</a> array of Blu-ray optical drives, at 500 TB/KW.<br />
<blockquote><br />

      <p>via the <a href="http://www.sovlit.com/bios/mayakovsky.html">V. V. Mayakovsky bio in the Encyclopedia of Soviet Authors</a>:</p>

<p>In 1925 Mayakovsky also made one of his few forays into the sphere of utopian science fiction with his poem Letaiushchi Proletarii ("The Flying Proletarian"). As described by Victor Tarras in his biography of Mayakovsky, The Flying Proletarian was:</p>

<blockquote>...set in the year 2125 and features a giant air battle, with death rays and such, between the Soviet proletarian and the American bourgeois air forces. The latter prevails until an uprising of New York workers against their government turns the tide. Mayakovsky's communist future is all comfort and electric ease: electric razors, electric toothbrushes, everybody with his own private airplane (Moscow no longer has any streets, just airports). Labor is wholly mechanized, so that a worker merely operates a keyboard. Altogether, Mayakovsky's utopia is written from the viewpoint of a laborer who is tired of backbreaking, dirty work. . . . There are no kitchens, no housework. People eat in aerocafeterias and amuse themselves with cosmic cinemas, cosmic dances, and such--all nonalcoholic (alcohol is served by prescription only). The sport of the future is avio-polo--football has long since been abandoned as crude and boring.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-24-mechanical-blue/">mechanical blueberry harvesters</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If you're serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation.  Here's an example of a <a href="http://www.dbe.ca/blueberryharvester.htm">blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia</a></p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels. This rotation is at a speed in ratio to the forward motion of the tractor. As the comb type-picking bars rake the blueberries from the plants they are carried around the reel and deposited in a conveyor. This conveyor delivers them to another longer conveyor, which carries them to the rear three-point-hitch mounted loading platform. As the berries fall from the conveyor a blower cleans them.
</blockquote>

<p>The harvester was invented by <a href="http://www.nsac.ns.ca/halloffame/citations/bragg_douglas.htm">R. Douglas Bragg</a> (1930-1996):</p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg always maintained a strong interest in the blueberry industry. Not only was he a manufacturer of the patented wild blueberry harvester and a blueberry producer himself, but he was an active member of the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia. From 1979 to 1981 he served as a Director and was an active member of the Research Committee from the time of its inception until the fall of 1996. He was a Founding Director of the Nova Scotia Blueberry Institute and was instrumental in the early days of its development and building of the research field station at Debert. In 1995 Doug received the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia Award of Recognition.
</blockquote>

<p>There's a set of patents on blueberry harvesters.  Here's what US Patent <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5375403/description.html">5365403, Lowbush berry harvester</a> has to say about the Bragg patented harvester:</p>

<blockquote>
A later development is reported in Canadian Pat. No. 1,249,727 of Bragg Lumber Company. According to the patent, this harvester mounts a picking head, almost identical to the Chisholm-Ryder head, on the side of a farm tractor, but in such a manner that the picking head is "towed " by the tractor. The arrangement ostensibly accommodates variations in the ground by allowing for pitch and roll of the head during operation. As with the Chisholm-Ryder head, the tines of the Bragg harvester are controlled by a cam and cam follower arrangement. In the Bragg harvester, as the tines approach top dead centre of the reel they are caused to flap rapidly to dislodge the berries carried thereby for easy deposit on the internal conveyor.
</blockquote>

<p>On my favorite blueberry-picking grounds, there's way too many ferns, jack pines, jack pine cones, bits of lichen and moss to ever make it suited for mechanical harvesting; just as well.</p>
