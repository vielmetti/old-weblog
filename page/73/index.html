        <p>In the manage by numbers world...
One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress. At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.
If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">&raquo;</a></p>

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily.

The time is the future, but the near future, within reach - perhaps 2012. The hero has some kind of cognitive deficit that's progressive, so that they are slowly losing their ability to reason. (Think Flowers for Algernon, for instance.)
The twist is that the nature of the loss of thinking is that they are fine in person and in everything they normally do, but that they are unable to effectively use search engines any more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-25-noe-web-disease/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS
By John Clark
My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-blueberry-summe/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It's fruit season (or nearly so) and so it's time to start thinking about what we're going to do for making holiday gifts. One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy.
We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Around the world, we're focusing attention on the importance of the internet to political participation - that's this year's theme. We're also encouraging people to talk about (and do something about) internet issues they're worried about - censorship, the digital divide, inadequate connectivity generally. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-one-web-day-is/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>&quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&quot; (Jack Shedd)
Jack has more in a rant that&#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &quot;cheese food manufacturing&quot; that Merlin Mann observes as dominating the world of &quot;pro bloggers&quot;.
In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &quot;pick any two&quot; is the easiest answer. It&#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

It's just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.
There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor. The Dexter Blueberry Farm is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-09-2008-michigan-b/">&raquo;</a></p>
