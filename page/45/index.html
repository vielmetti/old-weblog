<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I can't help myself to think of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle when considering the new Google+ system and how it organizes people into circles. The circle, properly constructed, is a "karass", the people who you are following around and around. The pivot of the karass is a "wampeter", the thing which draws you together - "a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail".</p>
<p>I go back to Seb Paquet's <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/2002/10/09.html#a426" target="_self">essay on ridiculously easy group formation</a>&nbsp;as a sense for how the Internet used to be if you wanted to start a collective enterprise. Most of the tasks at that time were relatively heavyweight, in that you had to begin something and set up the software infrastructure before you started to use it. Now, with most social networks, group formation is as easy as settling on a name for what you are doing, making that name prominent within your communications (e.g. using it as a hash tag), and then just doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at Google+ for pivots, you find people, but not ideas. Energy clusters around individual activity, and though it's possible to nominally describe a circle of people as being interested in football or ice hockey, you can't guarantee that those people will reciprocate by only writing about football or ice hockey. One thing you do all have in common, though is Google+ - and thus the wampeter that draws you all in is the system itself.</p>
<p>Following Vonnegut again there are two wampeters for each karass, one waxing, one waning. Fortunately we do have the other one named here already; an animal. Specifically a cat.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-10-nine-circles-of-googleplus/">Nine circles of</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of the fun of <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_self">Google+</a>&#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &quot;circles&quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&#39;s private groups). It&#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard.</p>
<p>If Google knew who I went to high school with, it would be inviting me to make a &quot;high school friends&quot; circle, and it would be planning a reunion. But it&#39;s Facebook where that activity is going on, and Facebook where that particular circle of friends and former friends lives. It lives there not because I carefully and laboriously put it there but because Facebook has a group structure (however imperfect) that allows for shared group building, shared tagging of photos, shared lots of things.<br /><br />On Google+ I have no visibility into what other people&#39;s groupings for me are. If you think about just that, it&#39;s remarkable - no one would add me to a mailing list and start sending me things without me knowing it, and no one adds me to a named Facebook community or even a Twitter list without that being at least nominally visible. Yet only Google knows what other people categorize me as, and as more random names show up in my &quot;you were just added to a circle by...&quot; list, the more that particular information asymmetry seems to be visible.</p>
<p>It has been wearying to try to make sense of circles. If you engage in the system, you are expected to classify and categorize all of your correspondents into some kind of bucket that describes them. Alas, real people are many faceted, and don&#39;t fit into any single oversimplified category or stay narrowly focused on one topic. More to the point, I can&#39;t stay on topic myself unless I have a separate place narrowly defined where I&#39;m exploring a topic rather than just vacuuming up something interesting.</p>
<p>Google+ circles have cut into my sleep, and that&#39;s why you see circles under my eyes. I&#39;m better off resting up and spending the time creating things rather than figuring out which tiny bucket to sort them into.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-newsroom-vs-newsroom/">Newsroom vs. newsroom: listening, or not listening, to the scanner</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.</p>
<p>In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in. They may have more context of the local situation, more access to people in positions of leadership, or more ability to get someone on the street to see something interesting, but they are not there first on the scene with exclusive coverage.</p>
<p>Last night, over ten thousand people listened in live and in real time as a hostage situation in Grand Rapids, Michigan came to a violent end over the police scanner. Everyone listening heard it first hand, before the news media had a chance to interpret it for them.</p>
<p>The best account of listening to the scanner is Mark W. Smith&#39;s Detroit Free Press piece, &quot;<a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110708/NEWS06/110708030/Mark-W-Smith-Online-police-scanner-an-eerie-window-into-gunman-s-standoff" target="_self">Online police scanner an eerie window into gunman&#39;s standoff</a>&quot;, which paints a vivid picture of what it was like to be in a newsroom listening to scanner traffic from hundreds of miles away. In contrast, Nathan Bomey&#39;s piece &quot;<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/grand-rapids-murders-terrorize-but-jennifer-granholm-tweeting-about-her-new-chevy-volt/" target="_self">Grand Rapids murders terrorize, but Jennifer Granholm tweeting about her new Chevy Volt</a>&quot; is noteworthy primarily for not sounding like it was written with the scanner going in the background - because if you were paying attention to what was happening in Grand Rapids while it was happening, you&#39;d never even have noticed that some people weren&#39;t yet tuned in yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-recyclebank/">Recyclebank Ann Arbor reports released; coupon redemption rates are low, but people recycle anyway</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the City of Ann Arbor has released reports showing the participation rate of Ann Arbor households in the <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/" target="_self">Recyclebank</a> program, which rewards citizens for putting out their recycling. The reports were provided in graphical format, so all numbers here are approximated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20May%202011%20Report.pdf" target="_self">summary report of program performance</a> provided in response to the request shows that about 40% of eligible citizens (about 9500 of 24000) have signed up for the program. These citizens accumulate points which can be exchanged for coupons that offer discounts to participating merchants. In the most recent month reported, May 2011, citizens earned about 1.5 million points and cashed in about 10% of them, resulting in about 1600 rewards ordered.</p>
<p>The Recyclebank contract costs the City of Ann Arbor about $200,000 per year. At current reward redemption rates, citizens will cash in on the order of 20,000 reward coupons, or less than one per eligible household, at an estimated program cost of approximately $10 per delivered coupon. This number could be $15 per coupon at the low monthly participation rate, and $7 per coupon at the high monthly rate; participation varies with the seasons, and a complete year of data is not yet in.</p>
<p>The reports provided do not address the question of whether rewards are increasing participation in the recycling program. If it did, this <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20Route%20by%20Route%20Report%20May%202011.pdf" target="_self">detail report showing recycling rates per route</a> would also include a Recyclebank participation rate per route, and you&#39;d be able to see at a glance whether routes with a high degree of Recyclebank participation correlate with increased recycling performance.</p>
<p>Are incentives driving increased recycling use? The reports provided do not make a compelling case. Redemption rates are so low that most people don&#39;t appear to bother cashing in their rewards. Even with this low redemption rate, almost 90% of people put their recycle cart out at least once a month, suggesting that people in Ann Arbor are already recycling at a high rate independent of external rewards.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>U-Pick Strawberry season in the Ann Arbor area is over; it ended June 29 at Rowe&#39;s, and June 26 at Whittaker&#39;s.</p>
<p>Juneberries are still on the trees, but they are overripe and best left for the birds.</p>
<p>Mulberries are out in full force on the trees and on the sidewalks. Look down for black blotches, then look up for ripe berries.</p>
<p>Blackberries and black raspberries can be found in parks or in the yards of helpful neighbors.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://wasemfruitfarm.com/" target="_self">Wasem&#39;s</a> has&#0160;U-pick&#0160;red and green gooseberries, red and black currants, and tart (sour) cherries, starting July 7. Not everything is always available depending on ripening, call ahead for details.</p>
<p><a href="http://dexterblueberry.com/" target="_self">Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> is expecting to open July 20, according to their email; the web site says July 25.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.realtimefarms.com" target="_self">Real Time Farms</a> for more details on local produce. If you have any spare berries, let me know.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was away from my computer for a few days, but still near my Blackberry - a not-so-smart smartphone with a rudimentary web browser that is reminiscent of the finer parts of web browsing circa 1995. It&#39;s even better than 1995 in that the browser is so portable that it can go with you everywhere, and thus can be reasonably expected to be a mobile companion on social network outings.</p>
<p>Twitter is completely usable on this device, and the brief updates that people provide are ideal. The mobile Twitter web interface doesn&#39;t do a lot to support lists, but searches work great, and it&#39;s easily possible to follow along with what is going on and participate. It&#39;s an excellent companion in the car, especially when you&#39;re not driving. (Don&#39;t text and drive.)</p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s mobile web interface is rudimentary, but it does have access to almost all of the parts of the system that might make a difference. My phone is not smart enough to let me upload a photo directly into Facebook, but it did allow me to drop in a pleasantry or two, enough to satisfy the minimum social obligation.</p>
<p>Gmail on this device is slow, but fully functional. I wasn&#39;t able to keep up with my inbox, but it wasn&#39;t like I was really trying to, and it was incredibly handy to be able to search my email archives when I needed to.</p>
<p>Google+ is new, and it used to have support for my miserable browser when it launched; but that disappeared soon after launch. I was unattached to G+ throughout its holiday launch weekend.</p>
<p>I am sure that if I had a more capable device, my preferences would be more towards the fancier, newer systems with richer user interfaces and more shiny attractive access. That said, I don&#39;t know if more access is actually better when I&#39;m on the move. All three systems accumulate a social debt that has to be repaid in some way, in that mentions should be reciprocated, messages should be returned, and plans should be acknowledged. Unless you&#39;re willing to be transmit-only when you&#39;re on the move, none of the systems had enough bandwidth on my slightly-smart phone to really keep up with accumulated social network debris.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I have just now gotten access to Google+, so this review is a reflection of other reviews, some personal experience, and a weary view of novelty.</p>
<p>Google+ is out in very limited test. Some small number of well connected people now have access to a new piece of social software from Google, and initial reviews have been generally positive.</p>
<p>How do you assess whether the initial reviews of a system designed for communications are accurate for when the system eventually gets rolled out to a wider audience? Consider that the first people into the system were hand picked, that they generally like getting access to new systems, and that they are relatively experienced and gregarious online experts. Certainly they will like something new that only they have access to - quite independent of the set of features - because it gives them a chance to reconnect to old online friends and make some new ones.</p>
<p>When a communications system becomes available to the general public, the system dynamics change greatly. The initial group of participants can all be presumed to be interesting to each other, so talking to any random individual is likely to be someone relatively near you in social circumstance. As the population explodes, the random person gets less and less interesting, to the limit of when the random person is likely to be a spammer.</p>
<p>Google+ is at the invention stage. Much like Facebook seeded its early use poll with Ivy League students, Google+ is doing its shakedown cruise with fans and friends and family in the first batch. Who wouldn&#39;t like to try out a new, expensive, mostly empty system and establish yourself in it? I&#39;m waiting for the next round of invites, and hoping to enjoy it while it&#39;s in early growth stages and not when it&#39;s in long-in-the-tooth maintenance mode.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I walked a lot more today than I normally would have walked, thanks to my new game <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game.html" target="_self">Walking Around</a>. Here&#39;s some of the bonus points I scored that I wouldn&#39;t have scored in my previous quest, Sitting Around Typing.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Path (+1). It&#39;s always good to find a way to get from here to there that&#39;s not on any map. The pedestrian path I found connects Needham Road to Amelia Place. I&#39;ve added that little segment to <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_self">Open Street Map</a> so that I can find it again, and so that I can cut through one more neighborhood with confidence. My son and I took this route to his summer camp today, and he suggested one more point for Unfamiliar Route (+1).</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838031970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 3" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Unexpected Lunch Companions (+2). If you wait for the bus at a bus stop near a restaurant, and if someone you know happens to be driving to that restaurant, then not only can you have an unexpectedly pleasant lunch but you can also get a ride downtown. Thanks to the Toziers for the happy coincidence and for a beginning of a discussion of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Annexation" target="_self">annexation and township islands</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 4" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f8384ee970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 4" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Urban Foraging (+1). Juneberries are in season, which means that a carefully selected path will take you past some delicious snacks, right out there in the open, where thousands of people walk each day but none notice except the birds and a few brave souls who appreciate <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org/city/Juneberries" target="_self">Amalanchier</a>. For more berrypicking ideas, I follow Linda Diane Feldt&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/wildcrafting" target="_self">@wildcrafting</a> Twitter account. For lots more detail on Amalanchier, the 1946 <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24609952M/American_species_of_Amelanchier" target="_self">American Species of Amalachier</a> has ranges and keys for native species.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 5" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f838a8b970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 5" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Park Benches (+2). If, at the end of your trek, you stop to wait for the bus - then it&#39;s useful to note that sometimes the bus stop is close to a park which has a park bench in the shade. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Douglas_Park" target="_self">Douglas Park</a>&#0160;is a nice place to wait for the #4, especially if you have <a href="http://mobile.theride.org/" target="_self">RideTrak</a> running on your cell phone to tell you when to get up and walk to the stop 1/2 block south of the park. My walk the next morning circled around all the way back to this park bench.</p>
<p>North Star (+1). A nice night walk on a clear night gives you all of the directions you need when Polaris is visible in the north sky. The drawing is from H. A. Rey&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547132808/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=superpatron-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0547132808">The Stars</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0547132808&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" width="1" />, my all time favorite book about the night sky.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 6" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01543356d221970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 6" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>How do I come up with this bonus point structure? If you walk around enough, something that you see or do is bound to make you happy. Give yourself points for those happy places, and know where they are so that you can revisit them.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-28-walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game/">Walking Around, a new urban walking game</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s played.</p>
<p>First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including <a href="http://walkertracker.com/" target="_self">Walker Tracker</a>, <a href="http://swellnessresearch.wordpress.com/projects/steps/" target="_self">Steps</a>, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily.</p>
<p>Second - and here is what is novel, at least to me - is that there&#39;s a bonus structure in the game designed to award bonuses for when you have accomplished tasks. The first bonus award that I&#39;m awarding myself looks at constructing a walk so that you make an orbit around the biggest possible chunk of territory; that is to say, repeated walks along the same path will get you zero bonus, but going out of your way on a detour will add to your score, and trekking through unfamiliar territory in a big loop is the best.</p>
<p>So far this is a pen and paper game and I haven&#39;t fully worked out the point structure. I have a notion that you capture territory every time you orbit it, so that you might win a park by going all the way around it, and you might win a political ward or precinct by capturing a loop around it. To simplify greatly, since I am trying to keep record of this in a small book, I&#39;m just drawing a graph with destinations rather than tracking every street.</p>
<p>Some idea sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aadl.org/node/18868" target="_self">Riverwalks Ann Arbor</a>&#0160;is a book of walking loops along the Huron River, written by&#0160;Brenda E. Bentley.</p>
<p><a href="http://laketrek.blogspot.com/" target="_self">Lake Trek</a> is the weblog for&#0160;&#0160;<a href="http://laketrek.blogspot.com/search/label/Loreen%20Niewenhuis" rel="tag">Loreen Niewenhuis</a>&#0160;who wrote <a href="http://www.brilliant-books.net/product/1000-mile-walk-beach" target="_self">A 1000-Mile Walk on the Beach</a>&#0160;about her circumnavigation on foot of Lake Michigan. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to beat that top score.</p>
<p>Tom Graham wrote about <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/18/PKG7DG81961.DTL#ixzz0YAiHcOQj" target="_self">Walking The World</a>, and his quest to walk every street in San Francisco, in 2005 for SF Gate; his web site is <a href="http://www.sfwalkingman.com/" target="_self">SF Walking Man</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://play.aadl.org/" target="_self">AADL Summer Reading Game</a>&#0160;has points for reading books and badges for doing various other tasks, and the gamers there know how to make a game that will make you read. There should therefore be points in my Walking Around game every time you complete part of a circuit that connects to a library.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allcitynewyork.com/" target="_self">All City New York</a> is the work of Moses Gates, whose game board includes the challenge of visiting all of the census tracts of New York City. Thanks to Ruth Kraut for the link.&#0160;</p>
<p>In Tacoma, <a href="http://xca2.com" target="_self">Brian Kerr</a> is getting bonus points in his version of the game for elevation.</p>
<p>Now pardon me while I connect some dots in my game map.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.</p>
<p>Some background for context.</p>
<p>The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3149678" target="_self">Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families</a> (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Top of page&quot; shows up in the news and design business as &quot;above the fold&quot;; see this Boxes and Arrows design article, <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/blasting-the-myth-of" target="_self">Blasting the Myth of the Fold</a>&#0160;(2007).</p>
<p>Facebook&#39;s Top News page comes from their Edgerank algorithm, the details of which change as quickly as and are kept as proprietary as Google&#39;s Pagerank algorithm.&#0160;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/" target="_self">EdgeRank: The Secret Sauce That Makes Facebook’s News Feed Tick</a> (Techcrunch, 2010) gives a simplified explanation of it.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.annarborsummerfestival.org/index.php/events/top_of_the_park/" target="_self">Top of the park</a>&quot; is the music and movies part of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, held on Ingalls Mall.

      </h3>
      <p><em>Steve Crocker, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3" target="_self">Internet Request for Comments 3</a>, from 1969: &quot;There is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.&quot;</em></p>
<p>From time to time, someone reads Vacuum and comments that the writing looks unpolished and incomplete. Why would you publish this kind of work, which obviously isn&#39;t up to the standards that would let you sell it to someone for use in print? Why wouldn&#39;t you hide it in your notebooks?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this weblog as a notebook, and publishing my notes for myself instead of always as a tightly edited, polished, finished work. By exposing this part of a process I hope to be prepared to find some way to make myself understood, even if I don&#39;t completely understand myself immediately as I write through an issue or question. Thoughts go in, get refined as far as they need to be to make them coherent, and then go onto the net and into the world so that there&#39;s room for the next piece to emerge.</p>
<p>The open notebook is going to be messy, but it also means that I have some hope of finding my own half-finished work and revisiting it years later; when I don&#39;t do that, there&#39;s always something lost. Writing this way lets me tune into ideas, spin them around for a bit until I have a clearer focus, and move on. In most cases, I&#39;m not ready to make things shiny and neat, and I&#39;m content to explore facets of an unpolished gem over a series of years.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at <a href="http://www.discardia.com" target="_self">discardia.com</a>. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.</p>
<p>For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. Before you can do a rebuild of a model that you already have, you need to find all of the impossibly tiny scattered pieces that make it up. A multipart storage box container is a great way to occupy a small boy&#39;s hour cleaning and sorting, because only when you have all of the yellow pieces together do you find the tiny Lego-sized firefighters accessories. Once you get down to the level that you can find the tiny black fireman&#39;s axe, the small child is content to build with it rather than agitate to buy more.</p>
<p>Books are my bane of accumulation existence, to the point where deciding what to do with them takes more energy than actually reading them. We have used Paperback Swap to maintain a steady state of inventory and still get new reading materials, and Books By Chance to dispose of surplus. Fortunately, the Lego situation (q.v.) is under control enough that I have reclaimed one bookshelf, which is being carefully curated as best I can to contain the collection that I would keep if it were my only shelf of books. Every decision to add to it means there&#39;s a corresponding decision to remove a book, and that keeps the shelf from accumulating dust and ennui.</p>
<p>The element of my life that absorbs more time than it should is the Internet, especially the Internet of flitting around from site to site trying to decide that someone has written something new worth writing. My self control is weak for shiny new things, but what I have discovered is that I can replace self control with ritual sometimes, and a ritual of writing on a specific topic for a specific person rather than reading aimlessly repays the time. I don&#39;t know yet how to cure a ritual addiction to being online, though Paul Jones&#39;s &quot;no email&quot; project points to one way to discard a portion of the online existence while staying connected.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">Potholes and performance warranties for road construction</a>
      </h3>
      <p>After a rough winter, potholes are <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">ubiquitous</span> on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.</p>
<p>The technology to <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">repair</span> a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. In comparison, preventing a pothole from appearing in the first place means spending a lot more capital on road construction to build a more sturdy roadbed capable of handling heavier loads and less likely to buckle or crumble with frost.</p>
<p>At an extreme, you get the original World War Two era Davison Freeway in Detroit, which was <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">over-engineered</span> so that no highway problems would get in the way of the speedy shipment of materials for the war effort. That roadbed lasted from 1942 to 1997 - beat up and dangerous at the end, but still working 55 years before it was rebuilt.</p>
<p>To spend less on pothole repair, spend more on road construction? Perhaps, though there is no guarantee that new pavement will withstand daily traffic. A possible solution is to <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">give a contract which specifies that the road builder is also the road maintainer</span>, and that the cost of a pothole repair comes out of whatever profits were made by the building of the road. At least in theory, it would allow someone to make a reasonable tradeoff between current capital costs and future operations costs of maintaining a road; in practice, it probably would mean <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">low-ball bidding</span> by bidders who would build insubstantial roads and then under-deliver on the promise of keeping them maintained.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.qxork.com" target="_self">Fred Posner</a> for the prompt to write about this, and to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peggypage" target="_self">Peggy Page</a>&#0160;for post-publication editorial feedback. Previously on potholes: the Ann Arbor&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/a2csr.html" target="_self">Citizen Request System</a>. <a href="http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Casestudy/Davison.htm" target="_self">Archival photos of the Davison Freeway</a> under construction and at its first opening show the impact that freeway building has on a neighborhood. A <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100303-25651.html" target="_self">2010 story</a> describes potholes for sale in eastern Germany, with the purchaser getting a sponsorship message on the repair; a <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/kfc-and-peta-vie-to-fix-potholes/" target="_self">similar stunt in 2009</a> featured road repair by KFC.&#0160;&#0160;The city has a dedicated phone number to report potholes: call 734-99-HOLES.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em>Addendum: After publishing a first draft of this piece, I found this <a href="www.house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/warrant.pdf" target="_self">2001 Michigan House Fiscal Agency report on performance warranties for road construction</a>, which goes into some more of the purchasing process for major roadwork to understand how a road builder might manage a contract that required them to make whole a road that had not lived up to promises. It notes that a &quot;warranty bond&quot; would be required to ensure that if the road builder went out of business that the road would still be maintained - a sizable cost that would limit the number of bidders. A report from a <a href="http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/main.asp?secid=11464" target="_self">performance-based warranty for a rebuild of US 550 in New Mexico</a>&#0160;describes a successful project for a difficult road; the warranty costs are substantial, amounting to 20% of the total bid.&#0160;</em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-prediction-markets/">Prediction markets are too easy to game, so let&#39;s play games instead</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Prediction markets provide a nice, idealized way to use market mechanisms to predict the future. They are a slightly idealized version of an office betting pool and allow small scale bets (real or virtual) on future events. Unlike a real futures market, where you can get guarantees of future performance on things like delivery of gasoline or frozen orange juice, there&#39;s no way that betting on some prospective GOP hopeful will lift your candidate to office.</p>
<p>Market manipulation is the bane of most prediction markets. Consider Intrade, a prediction market in which GOP hopefuls are listed. The media will report that a newcomer is trading well, but won&#39;t necessarily note that the frontrunner&#39;s place is based on less than $500 worth of daily trades. If someone were to want to bump their favorite over the top for at least a little while it would only take pocket money from a proper hidden campaign pocket to game the system in your favor.</p>
<p>Gaming the system is a problem in systems that pretend to be markets, and where some ideal form of market is lionized as a way to gain enlightenment from the invisible hand of Adam Smith. Turning the system into a game to be one sullies the economist&#39;s ideals of a rational allocation of resources based on infinite economic rigor.</p>
<p>Why fight people&#39;s tendencies to want to subvert the intent of the system builder? The new hot trend in online environments is gamification, where gaming the system becomes the whole goal of the system. Unlike markets, which try to come to truth with some single-valued score of value, games have the opportunity to bring the world into a lovely multi-valued focus, with different people winning each at their own version of the game. The introduction of badges, short term competitions, lots of ways to score points and other fun side games overwhelms the narrow trading interests in market-based predicitons.&#0160;</p>
<p>The future of prediction markets lives inside complex predictive games. The game design has to take into account not only the rapid conclusions that you can draw when you have an efficient market for opinions, but also the continuous efforts you have to keep up to maintain people&#39;s attention on a topic for any length of time. The good games reward active participation; the challenge becomes how to draw conclusions from the work of engaged gamers working inside your system.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://xca2.com/" target="_self">Brian Kerr</a> for the idea. Games are on my mind because of the work of the Ann Arbor District Library and Eli Neiburger to <a href="http://play.aadl.org" target="_self">build games into the summer reading program</a> at the library. I tried to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2007/02/predicting_hold.html" target="_self">predict library use</a>&#0160;with a prediction market in 2007, and <a href="http://home.inklingmarkets.com/markets/17016" target="_self">attendance at lunch</a>&#0160;in 2009, using Inkling Markets. The game of choice at the Workantile Exchange is a version of bingo; when I bring my kid to work an alert player may win. The <a href="http://www.intrade.com/v4/markets/contract/?contractId=652757" target="_self">Intrade GOP market</a> shows the book of available trades; at this writing, purchasing about 300 shares of Mitt Romney would push the price up 8% at a cost of less than $1200. <a href="http://www.empireavenue.com/" target="_self">Empire Avenue</a> turns social media friendships into a giant game, with badges and prizes.</em></p>

      </h3>
      <div>
<blockquote>“People writing in a wiki often put important concepts or terms on separate pages in order to refer to them. If the name of such a page is repeatedly used by many to point to an idea described or discussed on it, the page has become a part of the <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">link language</span> of the respective wiki-community.”&#0160;–&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/RadomirDopieralski">RadomirDopieralski</a>&#0160;&amp;&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/MattisManzel">MattisManzel</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004">LinkLanguage2004</a></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004"></a>If you do a lot of writing on one topic, there are recurrent themes and key words and phrases that repeat themselves. The more specialized the topic, the more likely it is that the reader coming in for the first time will want to unpack some of the&#0160;<span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">coded language</span>&#0160;that you are using and look for some background so that they can understand what precisely it is that you are trying to say. The coded language will include some special words that only you yourself understand, and you hope that by repetition in a variety of contexts that someone else will pick up eventually on what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>A test of your ability to participate in a specialized community is your ability to readily understand what is being said when those code words come up and appreciate some bundle of meanings and allusions that they are supposed to&#0160;trigger. &quot;Rosemary for remembrance&quot;, and when rosemary is mentioned in a song you are expected to bring that meaning with you. Close readers of Bible texts with their <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">careful concordances</span> share the same <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">sensitive ear </span>to all of the echoes of where a particular word or phrase is repeated for a specific effect that has been cultivated over the ages.&#0160;</p>
<p>The challenge in wiki is that the links are made explicit, and that they typically resolve to one particular concrete instance of one interpretation of an idea, as collectively edited within that wiki. If your link language is <span style="background-color: #ffdfbf;">perpetually inward focused</span>, you coerce the world you are building to look inward upon itself rather than providing some parallel outward-looking view.</p>
<p>If you back out of that system and consider broader possibilities, think of the problem as similar to constructing a <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">readable&#0160;</span><span style="background-color: #dcd1df;">command language</span>&#0160;in which invoking a particular phrase causes action to happen in the world. The Unix shell language is one particular instance of a command language, with its regular expressions as underpinnings for a system that expresses connections between processing elements as though there were data moving through plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Command languages gain some value because some of the encoding is made explicit. The difference can be readily seen in systems where hyperlinks to corporate names behave differently than hyperlinks to concepts or ideas. A business newswire will generally encode the name of the ticker symbol for a stock into a <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">specific referencable entity</span>, so that you don&#39;t have to interpret or guess what is being mentioned on the wire. Similarly, a link to a person&#39;s name in a news article could readily reference a biographical page or trigger a search for that specific name over a set of contact databases.</p>
<p>An advantage of recognizing this as a command language and not just a syntax for easy linking is that you can avoid the naive assumption that everyone who reads the language interprets it the same way. The language describes links between two parts of an <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">flexibly articulated wordscape</span>, but it&#39;s up to the reader to resolve that link into something concrete. The modern web software fails to live up to the promise of understanding just how many variant interpretations there might be of one specific phrase, trading ease of linking for richness in expression.</p>
<p>Alas, the most prominent of command-based link languages degenerates into something very simple: &quot;buy now&quot;. The corresponding linguistic improvement is almost always &quot;make the buy button bigger&quot;. The language of electronic commerce degenerates into deducing which <span style="color: #ffbfff;">three weird words</span> will make the reader click through a link, guaranteed.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.markdilley.com" target="_self">Mark Dilley</a> for the idea, imperfectly explored here. John Lawler&#39;s <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/routledge/unix.html" target="_self">Unix for Linguists</a>&#0160;gave inspiration, as did the great weird ideas of Pete Kaminski as we were sorting out wiki syntax at Socialtext. At some point along the way, there was a universal wish to avoid needing any syntax in order to make links among related items, but the details as ever are elusive.&#0160;</em></p>

<p>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&#39;s Day at <span style="background-color: #ff80bf;">Rowe&#39;s</span> in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends.</p>
<p>The boys are at the age where they are quick at berry picking and accurate enough not to pick bad berries. They are capable of picking more than they can eat. I&#39;m looking forward to more berrypicking with them!</p>

      </h3>
      <p><blockquote>
<p>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&#39;s, ALS, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">diversity</span> of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>A parallel set of diversity-seeking looks to build connections with people who have diverse ways of perceiving the world. The <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">neurotypical</span> view of the world is best balanced with views from people who don&#39;t have nervous systems and sensory systems that perceive the world or act on those perceptions in the same way.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">Neurodiversity</span> is a word with some specific meaning within a community of people with autism-spectrum disorders, a community which I know only at the edges and can&#39;t count myself a core part of. In some ways I can only hope to approximate that perspective, e.g. in the occasional bits of <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">assisted synesthesia</span>&#0160;that I try to sneak into my writing. If you are living in a neurotypical world, the insight from someone with diverse sensory perception can trigger the <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">great weird ideas</span> that you find when worlds that were once foreign to each other gain a bridge that helps pull good thoughts from one side to the other. Or, perhaps, I&#39;m a&#0160;<span style="background-color: #e6ebd5;">neurodiverse</span> individual in this collection, and you are neurotypical by comparison; it&#39;s so hard to tell sometimes.</p>
