<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Since yesterday, thousands of people have read <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/06/black-forest-fire-near-colorado-springs-colorado-with-map.html" target="_self">my brief account of the Black Forest Fire</a>. I tried to include enough maps that someone far away from the fire (like me) would find some context for it that made sense, and enough detailed links to more local reporting and official sources that someone nearby would be able to get to the resource that had more current and on-the-spot coverage than I could ever do.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written fire-related posts before, including one for the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/duck-lake-fire-north-of-newberry-mi.html" target="_self">Duck Lake Fire near Newberry, MI</a> last year. I make sure to get good detailed maps of that area, because there&#39;s a pattern that burned-over areas provide good morel mushroom hunting the year after and good blueberry picking grounds for years to come.</p>
<p>When fires hit near an urban area, there&#39;s an immediate influx of television and newspaper resources to help local residents keep themselves and their homes safe. Imagery from fires is dramatic. When it&#39;s time to put this information on a map, it&#39;s a real challenge in real-time cartography in an environment where you might not always know exact details.</p>
<p>Writing about fires is thus a way to simultaneously make sense of the news and participate in its creation. You try to not make matters worse by carefully time and date stamping your observations so that it doesn&#39;t become old news that recirculates as new. Twitter is helpful but oh so fragmented, and most of the people I know through that channel are far enough away from any given incident not to care very much. The traffic to my Black Forest Fire page came in overwhelmingly from search, and the most common search term was &quot;black forest fire map&quot; - exactly the first thing that I was looking for when I heard about it. If you can answer &quot;where is this thing happening&quot;, &quot;do I know anyone nearby&quot;, and &quot;who knows more about it than I do&quot;, you can get to a point where your combination of links becomes a resource.</p>

      <p><p>UPDATED Thursday June 13, 6:00 p.m MT with new maps at the top.</p>
<p>The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog. Lots of photos and news are showing up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackForestFire&src=hash">#blackforestfire</a> Twitter tag. Residents can call 719-444-8300 for information on the fire, but no exact information is available on individual homes yet. Official info from <a href="http://www.elpasoco.com/Pages/default.aspx">El Paso County</a> will be <em>more current than this page</em>.</p>

<p>1. What days and times you were mentioned in the Twitter stream, broken into 6 hr intervals.</p>
<p>2. When people followed and unfollowed you, also in 6 hour timeline intervals.</p>
<p>3. Your &quot;best&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;all&quot; tweets, where best and good tweets have more favorites, retweets, or replies.</p>

It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). When you go back to reread what&#39;s been written down, some part of the memories come back. If you&#39;re lucky and captured some particularly salient point, the entire memory - the entire conversation - can return and you&#39;ll be transported back to another time and place.</p>
<p>A weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something that&#39;s not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you again. You&#39;d really rather never have to go through the ordeal again but just in case someone else happens on it you&#39;ll have that capsule of hard-won knowlege written down. You&#39;ll write it down so that you can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you&#39;ll relearn it as from new based on your old notes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating them with new information or with recollections that match the time. Every so often I&#39;ll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn&#39;t want to be something that I want to remember and that isn&#39;t forgotten yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don&#39;t want to be remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that I can&#39;t easily bring myself to completely deleting.</p>
<p>Some blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).</p>

I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&#39;s playing now and who&#39;s playing whom. The front page rotates new songs that if you&#39;re a quick click you can hear more or less in their entirety as they are being broadcast.</p>
<p>A particularly useful part of TuneIn is its &quot;trending&quot; tab, where it gives you real time feedback on which channels have the most activity. When people are listening primarily to music, it&#39;s a slow news day; when the top station is an all-news local channel, there&#39;s breaking news.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&amp;hl=en" target="_self">TuneIn Android app</a> has nearly all of the features of the web site, and it takes advantage of knowing where you are to offer up local stations. In addition there&#39;s a &quot;TuneIn Radio Pro&quot;, which gives you record and rewind for $4.99. There has to be a monetization strategy in there somewhere; they also serve up ads as you connect to some channels.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Screen shot 2013-06-10 at 9.55.51 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Screen shot 2013-06-10 at 9.55.51 PM" /></a>Open up a &quot;New Post&quot; window, start typing.</p>
<p>Look at the categories on the right side of the screen - my screen, not yours. There&#39;s an infinite scrolling list of them, from &quot;Americana&quot; to &quot;zzz Draft Postings&quot;. Somehow, categories became the wrong way to describe what is in this blog; aside from &quot;Ann Arbor&quot;, there&#39;s few of them that have routine postings. But with almost 3000 articles written, it&#39;s had to imagine any coherent way to recategorize them.</p>
<p>The problem with categories, buckets, or really any hierarchical system for putting things in one place or another is that there&#39;s always the new thing that defies categorization and asks for its own category. I&#39;m not willing to have a big &quot;Other&quot; category, but I am willing to have an &quot;Oklahoma&quot; category that only gets a few posts a year (earthquakes, tornados).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used systems that depend heavily on categorization to make them work. You set up some kind of ongoing task depending on how things or (worse) people are sorted into buckets. Suddenly the world needs bright divisions between one kind of thing and another kind of thing, and any ambiguity about status has to collapse into a single value to make the system make sense.</p>
<p>Some tools in my experience have been better than others for recategorization. I&#39;ve written before about Maxthink, a 1980s era MS-DOS &quot;idea processor&quot; (still available in Windows) that has a concept of &quot;binsort&quot;, which is an extraordinarily rapid and keyboard-driven way to shuffle and reshuffle items into a hierarchy. That system never really got enough traction to be copied wholesale by any other system, and so it lives on in the world only through dim memories and hardcore users. </p>
<p>Reshuffling a tree with lots of existing categories is really hard work, because short of wiping out all previous categorization and starting anew you are almost guaranteed to have some vestiges of the old order in place as you&#39;re trying to assert a new set of groupings. Even the infinitely flexible Wikipedia has this problem, as it inherited some parts of its classification system from older encyclopedias like Brittanica.</p>
<p>So I struggle with sorting through the contents and give up more often than not, relying instead on search rather than careful categorization to unearth old things and to draw relationships among nominally related works. It&#39;s the problem that <a href="http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/" target="_self">everything is miscellaneous</a>&#0160;and too many things are interrelated and that my knowledge of the world too often seems a mile wide and an inch deep.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem of miscellany is the tendency of our Internet to rot out from under us, with old sites and old links disappearing as people redesign or move on or give up. There&#39;s hardly any way to refer to something without quoting it nearly in full, for fear that when you want to go back to it there will be nothing there to see.&#0160;</p>
<p>I seem to be rambling, what was the point again? Oh, categories and their utter impossibility of reflecting the current real world and the horrific difficulties of rethinking them half way through your efforts to use them. It so happens that <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/categorization" target="_self">I have a categorization category</a>, which hopefully has some relationship to this brief essay.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.</p>
<p>Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home. Some stayed in Marquette, or came back after college, or moved to even smaller towns nearby.</p>
<p>Ask about their family, and you will find that some of your classmates are grandparents.</p>
<p>Ask about what they are doing. &#0160;I was surprised to find some of my classmates having had 25 or even 30 years of continuous career in the same field or even with the same employer.</p>
<p>I found myself mostly talking to people who I talked to in high school - as my friend Tim put it we found the &quot;geek table&quot; and occupied that. Some things never change, and all we would have needed was a Rubik&#39;s Cube and we could pick up where we left off.</p>
<p>People do change a lot in 30 years. A small handful of folks look remarkably like what they looked like 30 years ago, plus or minus an 80s hairdo. Others changed a lot, not always in a direction I would have expected.</p>
<p>There was a small shrine to the classmates who had died, and it was sad and surprising to see young faces and realize that you wouldn&#39;t be seeing them again, not here and not anywhere.</p>
<p>All in all, it was one of those parties that reminded me of the very few high school parties I went to - lots of people standing around drinking beer, a few people dancing, and the DJ playing the B-52s. I&#39;m looking forward to the next event some 5 or 10 years from now to see how we&#39;re still all holding up.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-08-how-did-i-meet-you-how-do-i-know-you/">How did I meet you? How do I know you?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.</p>
<p>The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. If I can hit each of those three perspectives on a relationship, chances are that it&#39;s easy to start up a new conversation and easy to call someone to mind when it&#39;s time to make a new introduction.</p>
<p>Alas, most personal address book software does a lousy job of keeping tabs on any of this. You can add a &quot;related to&quot; field in some systems, but that&#39;s not something that I&#39;ve seen pulled out and turned into a full featured exploring tool. If you&#39;re lucky you get to enter some free text in some notes field, but even then you might not get the ability to search it on the fly. And heaven help you if you want to tag or group or categorize or classify people (for your own memory purposes) without fighting a system that generally is indifferent to the idea that people might belong to more than one group.</p>
<p>If I can dream, I&#39;d like the simple app - perhaps just a thin front end to my address book - that flashes names in front of me and helps me quickly remember who&#39;s who and how I might know them. This is multiply true right now because I have a lot of dormant connections to people that I&#39;d like to refresh. A smart address book, or a routine way of collecting that information in a dumb address book, should be able to help that process out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It turns out that one of the recent updates to LinkedIn adds a &quot;how did I meet you&quot; question, with the ability to link to a person as the introducer. It&#39;s a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-04-some-notes-from-a-lunchtime-talk-on-social-media/">Some notes from a lunchtime talk on social media</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few highlights, not the whole talk.</p>
<p>My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.</p>
<p>For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;followers&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</p>
<p>Regarding frequency, the notion is that communications media have a natural rhythm, and that you need to be aware of how often you post or comment so that you don&#39;t either overrun the medium or be so quiet as to be unnoticed.</p>
<p>Finally mobility is the observation that more and more people are coming to the net primarily through mobile devices and if you want to serve them you need to have a solution for your web and net presence that looks good on the small screen.</p>
<p>I was greeted with a fair degree of skepticism about the value of social media for business, especially from someone who cancelled his Facebook account and never has been on Twitter. There was good discussion of how hard it is to simultaneously be brand-conscious and be aware of a professional persona vs. sharing details of a personal life. I think it&#39;s harder for people in an agency role whose job it is to make the client look good but who don&#39;t have to have a personal public identity in order to do their work.</p>
<p>Some day when I retire I&#39;ll give up on social media entirely and just send postcards to people - they are novel compared to the communciations that people mostly get, they&#39;re quite portable and mobile, no one expects a frequency of a postcard more than once in a long while, and if you send postcards you&#39;re likely to get postcards in return.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.</p>
<p>I'm going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me.</p>
<p>1. Gmail is getting a new user interface, one that adds tabs and more integration with Google+. (<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">Gmail Blog</a>) "I know we feel the need to comment on everything right away these days, but honestly there isn't much to say about this feature until we've actually used it." (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787063">223 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. "The Drupal.org Security Team and Infrastructure Team has discovered unauthorized access to account information on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org." Users are advised to change their password, not to reuse passwords between sites, and to turn on two-factor authentication. 
(<a href="https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate">drupal.org</a>) 
"Malicious files were placed on association.drupal.org servers via a third-party application used by that site." - and commenters are wondering which third-party app was involved. 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788909">7 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. For $100/node/month, Linode announces a managed IT infrastructure. 
(<a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/05/29/introducing-linode-managed/">Linode</a>) 
"If the remote hands are awesome, this is well worth $100 per node. If they are anything but awesome, this wouldn't be worth it for any amount of money." 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788576">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>4. "The Magazine" has been sold by founder Marco Arment to editor Glenn Fleishman.
(<a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/29/sold-the-magazine">Marco Arment</a>)
Instapaper. Tumblr. and now The Magazine. Sounds like Marco is clearing house a bit.
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787079">57 comments</a>)</p>
<p>5. How to negotiate a job offer. "If you’re not currently working, and you don’t have competing offers, you’re pretty much out of luck."
(<a href="http://blog.upstart.com/2013/05/how-to-negotiate-job-offer.html">Upstart</a>)
"The "Pre-Reqs" piece is not right. You really don't need to have another job offer or a current job to negotiate. "
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787759">44 comments</a>)</p>
<p>6. Bill Gates is going to India because it has the grand challenge of extreme poverty and also the resources to attack that problem. He's also going to pick up some dance moves from a Bollywood star.
(<a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Topics/Development/Why-Im-Going-to-India">The Gates Notes</a>)
"Have you seen real poverty? Just take a trip to Mumbai and visit the slums there."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788874">25 comments</a>)</p>
<p>7. Amazon announces "Login with Amazon" as a single sign-on function for web sites.
(<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1824961&highlight=">Amazon PR</a>)
"I think this is a great idea. I don't love the Facebook OAuth flow and the amount of access most apps ask for."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5786554">69 comments</a>)</p>

      <p><p>A late evening version of Hacker News for Tuesday 28 May 2013. I&#39;ve added links to the comments for each entry, and try to pull out a useful quote from the comments if there are any that are easy to find. Of interest: Pixar raytracing, Liberty Reserve money laundering, and Harvard email snooping.</p>
<p>1. A breakdown of github pull requests by acceptance rate, for a variety of languages and projects. If you want to get your pull request accepted, don&#39;t write C++, write Scala; and contribute to projects like Akka&#0160;and&#0160;backbone-fundamentals that take 80+% of pull requests.

<p>3. &quot;Liberty Reserve, which was incorporated in 2006, was a &quot;bank of choice for the criminal underworld,&quot; according to the indictment, which said the operation allegedly laundered the money through 55 million transactions before it was shut down earlier this month.&quot; $6 billion was allegedly laundered.

      </h3>
      <p>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini. This comes together in a hurry - you can cook the whole thing up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Two or three cloves of garlic</li>
<li>Asparagus, about a pound</li>
<li>Button mushrooms, about a pound</li>
<li>Basil, dried or fresh</li>
<li>White wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<p>Boil water for pasta. When it&#39;s hot, cook the pasta. There should be time to drain it after you&#39;ve done the cooking of the asparagus.</p>
<p>Wash the asparagus, snap the tough ends, and slice on the bias into 1.5&quot; pieces. Clean the mushrooms and cut each one in half.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large frying pan on high. Fry the garlic until it&#39;s light brown and smells great.</p>
<p>Add the asparagus to the frying pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the asparagus is bright green. Add the mushrooms and keep stirring. When the mushrooms are hot, add the white wine, stir, and cover.</p>
<p>The recipe called for basil, but I didn&#39;t put it in because I was hurrying to get everything together.</p>
<p>The wine will deglaze the pan and make a nice sauce. Serve with pasta and white wine.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-28-kale-with-corn-and-green-onions/">Recipe: Kale with corn and green onions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>oil for frying</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>1 bag kale</li>
<li>corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better</li>
<li>green onions - chopped</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Wash and spin-dry the kale, being careful to get dirt out of the center rib. We had a very nice bag of small kale from market that didn&#39;t require much more than this, but if you have older, tougher kales, trim them of their tough bits and cut them into pieces.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large pot on medium high to high. Chop some garlic into big pieces. Fry the garlic until light brown and it smells good.</p>
<p>Add the kale and cook, stirring frequently, until the kale has cooked down to a fraction of its original size. Add some corn and the chopped green onions; stir. Cook until the corn is warmed through, then add some soy sauce and cover and turn down the heat to low.</p>
<p>One bag of kale served the family, with one person not eating it; there were a few leftovers. This recipe would multiply quite nicely.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">Yesterbox: answer yesterday&#39;s email, today</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://yesterbox.com" target="_self">Yesterbox</a> is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. In contrast, &quot;yesterbox&quot; gives you a finite number of messages to work through from yesterday, and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. There&#39;s no need to feel guilty, no need to feel like you&#39;re procrastinating, and no need to obsessively check today&#39;s messages. They can all be dealt with tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hseih estimates that it takes him three hours to plow through a day&#39;s messages, and he puts that time on his calendar in the morning to handle the previous day&#39;s correspondence. That&#39;s the world of a busy and successful CEO - you might well have a different time chunk that you&#39;d need to commit to, probably a lot less.</p>
<p>Emptying the inbox is a Sisyphean task. Yesterbox tries to make it a finite problem to handle. As a bonus, every conversation becomes a slow conversation, and there&#39;s a lot of routine unimportant detail in everyone&#39;s inbox that can be ignored once a day has gone past.</p>

See also &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/03/meaningless-indicators-of-progress.html" target="_self">Meaningless indicators of progress</a>&quot;. I wonder how long it would take to process a day&#39;s worth of Twitter sent to you on one-day delay. In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was condemned to empty his email inbox each day, only to find it full the next day. &#0160;See Doug Mann,&#0160;<a href="http://www.adjunctnation.com/2006/09/01/54-the-electronic-myth-of-sisyphus/" target="_self">The Electronic Myth of Sisyphus</a>, 2006.)</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-on-summarization/">On summarization</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.</p>
<p>Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough. You might have to stitch together bits of several sentences to get one that describes the whole thing.</p>
<p>Summarization is active reading, and it improves recall. There&#39;s nothing quite like looking through a piece of text for its inner core to give you a real sense for what it&#39;s all about, and if you have to synthesize something new you recall that better than if you just hit the &quot;like&quot; button.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m skeptical of automated summarization, mostly because there seem to be enough people in the world interested in doing it by hand to make machine-aided cognition superfluous at least for popular articles. Machine reading works I suppose if you have so few eyes on the text that you have to crunch on it to make sense of it, but if there&#39;s an internet crowd to do that work the machine can simply tally human efforts instead of doing complicated automated text processing.</p>
<p>Hacker News is a challenging news stream to summarize because it turns over so quickly. In 12 hours or less, the top of the front page is fully new, and it&#39;s time to summarize again. I&#39;ve been doing it daily rather than 2x daily because the yield of interestingness just isn&#39;t there to call for more. There are other tech newsfeeds and newswires that are worth digesting, but not all of them are sufficiently different from Hacker News to provide a divergent task. For example, the top &quot;popular&quot; links on Pinboard overlap substantially with Hacker News, as does the front page of TechMeme.</p>
<p>Pinboard looks like it has the right kind of infrastructure to support summarization as a part of a workflow. The path would be to identify an interesting article, clip the good bit, hit &quot;pin&quot;, paste in the good bit, add a few tags, and save. To extract the useful stuff out you&#39;d run a report on the tag that you used that was unique to the category you were summarizing.</p>
<p>Summarization lends itself to pointless numbered bullshit (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2009/07/seven-things-i-want-to-remember-to-tell-you-about-blogging.html" target="_self">cf. #4 on this list</a>). Lots of articles are written with teaser headlines (5 best ways to do x) and can be unpacked by undoing the tease (The 5 best ways to do x are a, b, c, d, and e). You might take as your goal producing a summary that either dispenses with the need to read the original or that points the reader towards the best of what you have gone through and digested for them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.</p>
<p>I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. A useful bit of code would monitor the site, send off a batch of 10 articles to be summarized, and then wait checking periodically until those 10 have all fallen from favor to send out a new batch of 10.</p>
<p>1. Google has plans to outfit high-altitue blimps with telecommunications gear to serve Africa. &quot;Small-scale trials&#0160;<a href="http://google-africa.blogspot.se/2013/03/announcing-new-tv-white-spaces-trial-in.html">are underway</a>&#0160;in Cape Town, South Africa,&quot; using TV &quot;white spaces&quot; between channels as frequencies.

<p>2. Matt writes a love letter to Wordpress after 10 years of working on it. (<a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/" target="_self">Matt Mullenweg</a>)</p>
<p>3. &quot;When not even a Stanford or MIT engineering degree is good enough to keep an engineer employed at 60, there is genuinely no market for engineers that age. Plan accordingly.&quot; (<a href="http://lionoftheblogosphere.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/sucks-to-be-an-old-engineer/" target="_self">Lion of the Blogosphere</a>)</p>
<p>4. Haxe 3.0 is out. Haxe is a multi-platform, strictly typed modern language for cross-system and mobile development. (<a href="http://haxe.org/download" target="_self">Haxe</a>)</p>
<p>5. &quot;The hottest tech start-ups are solving all the problems of being twenty years old, with cash on hand, because that’s who thinks them up.&quot; (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_packer" target="_self">George Packer</a>, New Yorker) Not so fast; &quot;many of the hottest tech start-ups are solving the problems of being a business, because that’s where all the money is.&quot; (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/27/is-silicon-valley-only-interested-in-the-problems-of-twentysomethings/" target="_self">Ezra Klein</a>, Washington Post)</p>
<p>6. &quot;Unless you put time and effort into reading about and implementing exploits, your home-grown cryptography based security mechanisms don&#39;t stand much of a chance against real-world attacks.&quot; You are dangerously bad at cryptography; some examples follow.

<p>7. If you&#39;re looking for open source clones of your favorite games, you&#39;ve found it here. (<a href="http://osgameclones.com/" target="_self">Open Source Game Clones</a>)&#0160;</p>
<p>8. Some silly new annotations for you if you are written Java code, from the Google Annotations Gallery. (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/gag/" target="_self">GAG</a>) Start with @Noop and end with @Palindrome.</p>
<p>9. &quot;It&#39;s nuts that to make a new laptop relatively unthreatening and accessible for an enthusiastic 90-something requires going across a dozen System Preferences panes and sub-panes, and simply having to accept certain things as inevitably confusing.&quot; Setting up a Mac for Grandma is an exercise in appreciating the accessibility problems of the Internet.

<p>10. An explanation of SQL joins in Venn diagrams from 2007. (<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html" target="_self">Jeff Atwood</a>) Inspired by a previous post (<a href="http://www.khankennels.com/blog/index.php/archives/2007/04/20/getting-joins/" target="_self">Ligaya Turmelle</a>). Stack Overflow takes on the more complicated questions where the relationships don&#39;t fit into Venn diagrams so neatly.
