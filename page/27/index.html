<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

At the moment I&#39;m&#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!</p>
<p>The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.</p>
<p>Using his own cutting-edge research as a professor at Wharton Business School, Adam Grant shows how helping others can lead to greater personal success. He demonstrates how smart givers avoid becoming doormats, and why this kind of success has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organisations and communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m particularly intrigued by the notion that there&#39;s a distinction that creates &quot;smart givers&quot; that win some unspecified game through a generous strategy that pays off for them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/06/15/council-mulls-speaking-rule-changes/" target="_self">As reported in the Ann Arbor Chronicle:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn. The two councilmember speaking turns per question are proposed to be reduced from five to three minutes, and from three to two minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The revisions will be considered by the full council at its June 17 meeting, as agenda item&#0160;<a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1446404&amp;GUID=55CB03CF-7941-4008-B527-110AD78F2BC2&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">13-0767</a>. [<a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Council-Rules-2013-draft-changes.pdf">.pdf of marked up rules for June 17, 2013 council meeting</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two obvious reasons why this might come up on the council rules agenda. One the presence of an individual (<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Thomas_Partridge" target="_self">Tom Partridge</a>) who generally uses every single public comment time available to him to speak his piece; in a single meeting, Partridge might account for 20+ minutes of public comment time. A second reason is the very effective &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Citizens_filibuster" target="_self">citizens filibuster</a>&quot; that several organized opposition groups have used to talk Council into the wee hours of the morning during public hearings. A well-organized group can bring forty or fifty people to the dais, accounting for two hours plus of a public hearing.</p>
<p>Reducing public comment time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes will slow down the frequent commenter, and additional rules to restrict individuals from commenting at successive sessions will further cut into their time and leave room for others to speak. Capping citizens participation time to 2 minutes during public hearings is less likely to have an impact on total meeting times, however. A group that&#39;s capable of corralling 45 citizens to speak out will just have to get 68 in front of the cameras to make the same point. Never underestimate the number of issues where the irate citizenry will work as hard as they can to make an impact on their elected decisionmakers.</p>
Having a robust public process can be mighty inconvenient at times.<br /><ol>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a fickle relationship with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems/" target="_self">reminder systems</a>. Usually the drill is to discover something new, vigorously dump everything I can possibly think into it, and then slowly but surely get disillusioned with it as time goes on. The smell of a new system is seductive, and when something new comes along there&#39;s a tendency to look at its good side and to focus on the bad parts of whatever you were using before.</p>
<p>Thus my latest desire is to stop using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">Github as an issue tracking system</a> for personal reminders, and to start using Evernote. I&#39;ve written about Github before; the truth of it is that it&#39;s not a bad system, but it&#39;s set up enough for multi-person use that some of the easy affordances of single person use go to the wayside. Besides, my own use of it has tapered off and that&#39;s a sign that something new needs to take its place.</p>
<p>Evernote hasn&#39;t been written about much here, but there&#39;s a lot that I am starting to like about it. The <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/06/06/evernote-reminders-arrive-on-android/?utm_source=vacuum" target="_self">Android</a> support for reminders is new. Android support in general it lags a bit behind iOS. The level that I&#39;m currently using it it&#39;s still free. Their reminder system is new, but still looks at least minimally functional enough to get the work done. Since it fits in my phone pretty well it seems as though I should be able to make the transition and not be pinned down in front of my computer screen when it&#39;s time to brainstorm what to do next.</p>
<p>Basically it&#39;s what every new system is, the new system smell, while it&#39;s still revolutionary and not the politburo. Enjoy the new system before you figure out how to routinize it into distraction.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Since yesterday, thousands of people have read <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/06/black-forest-fire-near-colorado-springs-colorado-with-map.html" target="_self">my brief account of the Black Forest Fire</a>. I tried to include enough maps that someone far away from the fire (like me) would find some context for it that made sense, and enough detailed links to more local reporting and official sources that someone nearby would be able to get to the resource that had more current and on-the-spot coverage than I could ever do.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written fire-related posts before, including one for the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/duck-lake-fire-north-of-newberry-mi.html" target="_self">Duck Lake Fire near Newberry, MI</a> last year. I make sure to get good detailed maps of that area, because there&#39;s a pattern that burned-over areas provide good morel mushroom hunting the year after and good blueberry picking grounds for years to come.</p>
<p>When fires hit near an urban area, there&#39;s an immediate influx of television and newspaper resources to help local residents keep themselves and their homes safe. Imagery from fires is dramatic. When it&#39;s time to put this information on a map, it&#39;s a real challenge in real-time cartography in an environment where you might not always know exact details.</p>
<p>Writing about fires is thus a way to simultaneously make sense of the news and participate in its creation. You try to not make matters worse by carefully time and date stamping your observations so that it doesn&#39;t become old news that recirculates as new. Twitter is helpful but oh so fragmented, and most of the people I know through that channel are far enough away from any given incident not to care very much. The traffic to my Black Forest Fire page came in overwhelmingly from search, and the most common search term was &quot;black forest fire map&quot; - exactly the first thing that I was looking for when I heard about it. If you can answer &quot;where is this thing happening&quot;, &quot;do I know anyone nearby&quot;, and &quot;who knows more about it than I do&quot;, you can get to a point where your combination of links becomes a resource.</p>

<p>The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog. Lots of photos and news are showing up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackForestFire&src=hash">#blackforestfire</a> Twitter tag. Residents can call 719-444-8300 for information on the fire, but no exact information is available on individual homes yet. Official info from <a href="http://www.elpasoco.com/Pages/default.aspx">El Paso County</a> will be <em>more current than this page</em>.</p>

<p>The data, which matches up to the screen shot below:</p>
<p>1. What days and times you were mentioned in the Twitter stream, broken into 6 hr intervals.</p>
<p>2. When people followed and unfollowed you, also in 6 hour timeline intervals.</p>

It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). When you go back to reread what&#39;s been written down, some part of the memories come back. If you&#39;re lucky and captured some particularly salient point, the entire memory - the entire conversation - can return and you&#39;ll be transported back to another time and place.</p>
<p>A weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something that&#39;s not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you again. You&#39;d really rather never have to go through the ordeal again but just in case someone else happens on it you&#39;ll have that capsule of hard-won knowlege written down. You&#39;ll write it down so that you can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you&#39;ll relearn it as from new based on your old notes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating them with new information or with recollections that match the time. Every so often I&#39;ll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn&#39;t want to be something that I want to remember and that isn&#39;t forgotten yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don&#39;t want to be remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that I can&#39;t easily bring myself to completely deleting.</p>
<p>Some blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).</p>

I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&#39;s playing now and who&#39;s playing whom. The front page rotates new songs that if you&#39;re a quick click you can hear more or less in their entirety as they are being broadcast.</p>
<p>A particularly useful part of TuneIn is its &quot;trending&quot; tab, where it gives you real time feedback on which channels have the most activity. When people are listening primarily to music, it&#39;s a slow news day; when the top station is an all-news local channel, there&#39;s breaking news.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&amp;hl=en" target="_self">TuneIn Android app</a> has nearly all of the features of the web site, and it takes advantage of knowing where you are to offer up local stations. In addition there&#39;s a &quot;TuneIn Radio Pro&quot;, which gives you record and rewind for $4.99. There has to be a monetization strategy in there somewhere; they also serve up ads as you connect to some channels.</p>
<p>Recommended. For public safety scanner monitoring, <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/" target="_self">Broadcastify</a> is a good complement.</p>

<p>Look at the categories on the right side of the screen - my screen, not yours. There&#39;s an infinite scrolling list of them, from &quot;Americana&quot; to &quot;zzz Draft Postings&quot;. Somehow, categories became the wrong way to describe what is in this blog; aside from &quot;Ann Arbor&quot;, there&#39;s few of them that have routine postings. But with almost 3000 articles written, it&#39;s had to imagine any coherent way to recategorize them.</p>
<p>The problem with categories, buckets, or really any hierarchical system for putting things in one place or another is that there&#39;s always the new thing that defies categorization and asks for its own category. I&#39;m not willing to have a big &quot;Other&quot; category, but I am willing to have an &quot;Oklahoma&quot; category that only gets a few posts a year (earthquakes, tornados).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used systems that depend heavily on categorization to make them work. You set up some kind of ongoing task depending on how things or (worse) people are sorted into buckets. Suddenly the world needs bright divisions between one kind of thing and another kind of thing, and any ambiguity about status has to collapse into a single value to make the system make sense.</p>
<p>Some tools in my experience have been better than others for recategorization. I&#39;ve written before about Maxthink, a 1980s era MS-DOS &quot;idea processor&quot; (still available in Windows) that has a concept of &quot;binsort&quot;, which is an extraordinarily rapid and keyboard-driven way to shuffle and reshuffle items into a hierarchy. That system never really got enough traction to be copied wholesale by any other system, and so it lives on in the world only through dim memories and hardcore users. </p>
<p>Reshuffling a tree with lots of existing categories is really hard work, because short of wiping out all previous categorization and starting anew you are almost guaranteed to have some vestiges of the old order in place as you&#39;re trying to assert a new set of groupings. Even the infinitely flexible Wikipedia has this problem, as it inherited some parts of its classification system from older encyclopedias like Brittanica.</p>
<p>So I struggle with sorting through the contents and give up more often than not, relying instead on search rather than careful categorization to unearth old things and to draw relationships among nominally related works. It&#39;s the problem that <a href="http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/" target="_self">everything is miscellaneous</a>&#0160;and too many things are interrelated and that my knowledge of the world too often seems a mile wide and an inch deep.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem of miscellany is the tendency of our Internet to rot out from under us, with old sites and old links disappearing as people redesign or move on or give up. There&#39;s hardly any way to refer to something without quoting it nearly in full, for fear that when you want to go back to it there will be nothing there to see.&#0160;</p>
<p>I seem to be rambling, what was the point again? Oh, categories and their utter impossibility of reflecting the current real world and the horrific difficulties of rethinking them half way through your efforts to use them. It so happens that <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/categorization" target="_self">I have a categorization category</a>, which hopefully has some relationship to this brief essay.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.</p>
<p>Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home. Some stayed in Marquette, or came back after college, or moved to even smaller towns nearby.</p>
<p>Ask about their family, and you will find that some of your classmates are grandparents.</p>
<p>Ask about what they are doing. &#0160;I was surprised to find some of my classmates having had 25 or even 30 years of continuous career in the same field or even with the same employer.</p>
<p>I found myself mostly talking to people who I talked to in high school - as my friend Tim put it we found the &quot;geek table&quot; and occupied that. Some things never change, and all we would have needed was a Rubik&#39;s Cube and we could pick up where we left off.</p>
<p>People do change a lot in 30 years. A small handful of folks look remarkably like what they looked like 30 years ago, plus or minus an 80s hairdo. Others changed a lot, not always in a direction I would have expected.</p>
<p>There was a small shrine to the classmates who had died, and it was sad and surprising to see young faces and realize that you wouldn&#39;t be seeing them again, not here and not anywhere.</p>
<p>All in all, it was one of those parties that reminded me of the very few high school parties I went to - lots of people standing around drinking beer, a few people dancing, and the DJ playing the B-52s. I&#39;m looking forward to the next event some 5 or 10 years from now to see how we&#39;re still all holding up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.</p>
<p>The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. If I can hit each of those three perspectives on a relationship, chances are that it&#39;s easy to start up a new conversation and easy to call someone to mind when it&#39;s time to make a new introduction.</p>
<p>Alas, most personal address book software does a lousy job of keeping tabs on any of this. You can add a &quot;related to&quot; field in some systems, but that&#39;s not something that I&#39;ve seen pulled out and turned into a full featured exploring tool. If you&#39;re lucky you get to enter some free text in some notes field, but even then you might not get the ability to search it on the fly. And heaven help you if you want to tag or group or categorize or classify people (for your own memory purposes) without fighting a system that generally is indifferent to the idea that people might belong to more than one group.</p>
<p>If I can dream, I&#39;d like the simple app - perhaps just a thin front end to my address book - that flashes names in front of me and helps me quickly remember who&#39;s who and how I might know them. This is multiply true right now because I have a lot of dormant connections to people that I&#39;d like to refresh. A smart address book, or a routine way of collecting that information in a dumb address book, should be able to help that process out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It turns out that one of the recent updates to LinkedIn adds a &quot;how did I meet you&quot; question, with the ability to link to a person as the introducer. It&#39;s a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-04-some-notes-from-a-lunchtime-talk-on-social-media/">Some notes from a lunchtime talk on social media</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few highlights, not the whole talk.</p>
<p>My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.</p>
<p>For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;followers&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</p>
<p>Regarding frequency, the notion is that communications media have a natural rhythm, and that you need to be aware of how often you post or comment so that you don&#39;t either overrun the medium or be so quiet as to be unnoticed.</p>
<p>Finally mobility is the observation that more and more people are coming to the net primarily through mobile devices and if you want to serve them you need to have a solution for your web and net presence that looks good on the small screen.</p>
<p>I was greeted with a fair degree of skepticism about the value of social media for business, especially from someone who cancelled his Facebook account and never has been on Twitter. There was good discussion of how hard it is to simultaneously be brand-conscious and be aware of a professional persona vs. sharing details of a personal life. I think it&#39;s harder for people in an agency role whose job it is to make the client look good but who don&#39;t have to have a personal public identity in order to do their work.</p>
<p>Some day when I retire I&#39;ll give up on social media entirely and just send postcards to people - they are novel compared to the communciations that people mostly get, they&#39;re quite portable and mobile, no one expects a frequency of a postcard more than once in a long while, and if you send postcards you&#39;re likely to get postcards in return.</p>

      <p>A sample screen grab from tonight&#39;s W8UM net on 145.23. Please note that the radio I&#39;m using looks like it&#39;s out of tune a little bit, since I&#39;m actually listening here on 145.217.</p>
