                <div class="delicious-extended">Cowell doesn’t mention that the advertising is the most important part of the financial equation in paying for journalism, not the cover price. It has been so for as long as he’s been a journalist. The word “Advertise” appears three times on this Web page (and “Advertisements” once), but not in Cowell’s column.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Froomkin acknowledges the drop but told me much of it can be blamed on a change in format and poor promotion. He said that shifting White House Watch from a column to a blog when Obama took office was disruptive to his audience and &quot;dramatically reduced the number of page views per reader.” He also said poor promotion, especially through links from the home page, had caused traffic to dip. “I felt that with adequate promotion, page views would have been much higher,” he said.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Here, I should disclose an interest. I worked at Reuters for almost a decade. To my knowledge I was the last - or, as journalists prefer to say, one of the last - Reuters correspondents to file a dispatch by carrier pigeon. That was some years ago (or, as journalists prefer not to say, many years ago) and the birds that flew my dispatches in Zimbabwe&#039;s Matabeleland revived the means of pretechnological communication first used by Reuters in the mid-19th century.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">If this sounds highfalutin’, let me offer a personal counterpoint. As the last Reuters correspondent known to have to sent dispatches by carrier pigeon many years ago from Matabeleland, I thought, until events in Iran, that twittering was, quite literally, for the birds (birds other than my cooing messengers, of course).</div>

In the general case there may be software engineering advantages to working with rich languages like JAVA. However, in the specific case of a Naive Bayes classifier for discrete data, it is interesting to test if less is indeed more.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">In a phone conversation this morning, Kramer described the project as “an effort to move beyond banner ads,” which have proven lucrative for the site, but also limited. MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota. (That’s one reason the CPM is so good.) As a result, the site had several weeks this spring when marketers’ demand for advertising space exceeded the site’s supply of local readership.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">would rather the journalists who work for me walk the dog and talk to their neighbors or hit their neighborhood coffee house, or head straight to court/city hall to see what&#039;s happening rather than come in and cruise the wires and local newspapers.
The great thing is technology allows us to have a virtual meeting online. Arm journalists with laptops, webcams and phones and call the editorial meeting wherever and whenever they are. Too long have journalists been removed from the people they serve. (If not in reality, at least in the minds and attitudes of our community members.)</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">But the point, I hope, is clear.
The old means of control don’t work.
The old categories don’t work.
The old ways of thinking won’t work.
We all need to come to terms with that.

<p>Fundamentally, the old media won’t control news dissemination in the future. And organisations can’t control access using old forms of accreditation any more.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Encountered last week-end in Venice, Los Angeles. Still about press, I am fascinated by foreign press available as these A3 sheets of papers sold straight from the printer. Far from the complex e-paper technology, these very low-cost one-sided magazines show an interesting trend about the importance of physical artifacts. Besides, the name of this service (”paper direct”) is conspicuously relevant in these times of frenetic digitalization. Given that it’s printed locally, it’s an up-to-date instantiation (that prevent you from waiting two or three days to have the same newspaper coming from the guts of an Airbus/Boeing Cargo flight).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a story plays out across the Network, as new information is uncovered, the inputs are routed through the mixing board of the writer’s keyboard. A writer must now listen to how the whole jam is sounding— the writer is a player down in the groove with other players. As we learn to write through a real-time medium, we’ll need to look to the values, standards and practices of live performance. But these performances aren’t necessarily the traditional one-to-many events unfolding within a proscenium. We’ll need to dig into the performance theories of Richard Schechner and the Happenings of Allan Kaprow; revive the thoughts of Michael Kirby and The Art of Time, and the work of Fluxus. The journey from text on a page to hypertext on the Network is not a small adjustment to a business model; it’s a transvaluation of all values.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Localism ain’t it, unless it undergoes a total transformation of focus away from trying to sell real estate.  The Local ain’t it, unless it too undergoes a transformation and embraces the community on which it is reporting — and in fact, actually does some, you know, reporting.  The answer may be in social media, like MaplewoodOnline and Baristanet, as more and more journalists leave the newspaper business (by choice or not) and end up having to learn whole new skills in web-based, local, community-powered media.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Crisis communications used to be the handled exclusively through official channels like press releases, spokespeople and media relations. But today, through the power of socially distributed problem-solving, a first draft of history more nuanced and accurate than ever before is emerging from social media, and increasingly, people are turning to unofficial sources first, particularly in times of crisis.

<p>In this episode, social media crisis communications researcher at the ConnectivIT Lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder Leysia Palen shares what she has learned about social media usage during a crisis, assessing the credibility of citizen journalism and user generated media during a crisis, and how organizations might align with unofficial back channels in the future.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Although he had had to borrow money to buy the Gazette, his outside earnings soon freed him of any responsibility to Emporia&#039;s wealthy for the Gazette&#039;s editorial position. For the rest of his lifetime, he carried out the following editorial creed: &quot;What we want, and what we shall have is the royal American privilege of living and dying in a country town, running a country newspaper, saying what we please when we please, how we please and to whom we please.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Once people could no longer pick up the local gazette and find out who was visiting from California and when Helen Carter was going to sell her famous peach pies, the papers became less relevant to their lives.</p>

<p>Without that relevancy, society and democracy suffered. People became not only less informed, but less involved in their communities.</p>

<p>Consider that 57 percent of Americans say that if their local newspaper went away, both online and in print, they wouldn&#039;t miss it and it wouldn&#039;t hurt the civic life of their towns. The numbers are just as dismal when the question is isolated just to regular newspaper readers. This is in keeping with an earlier Harris poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans say their local newspaper doesn&#039;t serve its community well.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">For more than a decade, we expected to build online news organizations that could support a super structure of the modern newspaper newsroom -- with the all the reporters and editors and big story packages (look at all the emphasis we put on big Flash multimedia productions) and that we could keep doing journalism just the way we always did it.</p>

<p>While we bemoaned shovelware (taking the same exact print story and repurposing it for the Web), we took little time to really examine what might might be different about online publishing that should change the way news is gathered and presented.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">I’ve been asking Mark Josephson that question for months, and now he has an answer: Josephson, the CEO of local news platform Outside.in, figures the local, online-only newspaper of tomorrow,  for a decent-sized city, will have a staff of 20 people. That’s 20 people, period. Perhaps 6 of them will be “news gatherers.”</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Editor &amp; Publisher recently remarked about the difficulty in maintaining and moderating user comments:

<p>    ..traffic volume has made it difficult for any but the wealthiest media operations to monitor user comments as diligently as they do letters to the editor or “talk backs” to news directors. The combination of virtually open access and limited oversight has turned these public squares into mosh pits, without the latter&#039;s youthful exuberance or bonhomie.</p>

<p>Trying to adhere to policies that work to keep rules in place without disrupting or silencing the passionate voices of their readers have challenged media operators. Yet, many news media have taken steps in striking a balance between quality and quantity.</div><br />

      <p>Of course it isn&#39;t Wednesday yet, but I&#39;ll be a day early.</p><p>One of the things I&#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&#39;t exist yet.&#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen.</p><p>Every so often people do edit this page - but often they don&#39;t.&#0160; </p><p>A reasonable goal is to try to minimize the number of times people get frustrated, so one way to track that is to look at the fraction of pages over time where people hit a blank page and try to minimize that.&#0160; Looking at it over the last 3 months it appears that 3.2% of page views go to a page that doesn&#39;t exist yet - if you do a &quot;Top Content&quot; report, and then filter for the string &quot;redlink&quot;, you&#39;ll get what you want.<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 5" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-800wi" title="Picture 5" /></a> </p><p>One way to do continuous improvement, then, is to run a simple report for the pages on any given day, and look through them for ones where people clicked and didn&#39;t find anything.&#0160; Go to those wanted pages and search until you can put in something at least minimal for them.</p><p>Today&#39;s crop of such pages includes the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann%20Arbor%20Wine%20Club">Ann Arbor Wine Club</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Edward%20Burger">Edward Burger</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michael%20R.%20Reid">Michael R.

                <div class="delicious-extended">For a lot of products, such as alarm clocks, you’re only going to write a review if you have a negative experience. How does Amazon get people to write reviews? Most people don’t leave reviews. About 0.7% of people who buy something leave a review. But because Amazon has such a huge amount of customers, that equates to quite a lot. So the next time someone says, &quot;we should have reviews; that works really well for Amazon,&quot; you can respond with &quot;sure, we should have customers too; that works really well for Amazon.&quot;</div>

The book describes the “sugaring off” parties in Vermont, where people hosted neighborhood celebrations as they finished off the annual tapping of sap from trees for maple syrup. It describes the making of persimmon beer among Mississippi African-Americans. In and around Darlington, South Carolina, people would host outdoor gatherings and serve “chicken bog,” a distinctive chicken-and-rice dish. Nebraskans loved buffalo barbeque and Wisconsin folks enjoyed sour-dough pancakes.</div>

The commenter Robert Knilands (aka Wenalway) may seem your run-of-the-mill troll, but he expresses a virulent form of prejudice too frequently directed towards online and young journalists by some - and I stress, only some - print journalists. Robert Knilands says:

<p>    It can’t survive, though, as long as young journos are getting opportunities they are unqualified for and posting ignorant blog entries. All that does is destroy the present and the future.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.</p>
<p>It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all.</p>

Multi-Purpose Room
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Bring your camera and explore Ann Arbor! Photowalk is a fun way to
capture photos of the beauty of Ann Arbor and then post them online
for all to see. Our first Photowalk is held in conjunction with the
Library’s summer reading program, Local Motion - which encourages the
use of local neighborhoods, gyms, recreational facilities and outdoor
areas to explore Ann Arbor and get fit. We will begin with
presentations by several local photography experts, including: Myra
Klarman, professional photographer specializing in studio and
lifestyle portraits, Michael C. Myers, local photographer and a
founding member of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and Leisa
Thompson, Ann Arbor News Staff Photographer. Following the lecture, at
11:30 am, we will go out in small groups to photograph Ann Arbor. The
results will be an online exhibit of your photos in the aadl.org
pictureAnnArbor collection.

                <div class="delicious-extended">Newspapers have more important things to do than worry about comments—like, say, report the stories that blogs so desperately need in their 24-7 quest for content! After all, blogs are often not equipped to regularly break the news, and we need content to chew on.

<p>As Arthur Sulzberger&#039;s relation Benjamin Dolnick lamented in the comments section of Carr&#039;s NYT story (noticed by Choire Sicha at Radar): &quot;If you ever want to lose faith in humanity, read any comments section on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. Also, nobody wants to hear the tired old &quot;free speech&quot; argument as a defense of comments. We&#039;ve had free speech in this country for well over two hundred years, long before it was ever an option to comment on newspaper websites and blogs.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Brown agreed that reader comments are a &quot;really significant&quot; development in online journalism.</p>

<p>&quot;You could have a situation where you put up a story … and this amazing thing happens where people start taking your story apart, going through the facts — doing all sorts of background and fact-checking — better than any editor can do, because you&#039;ve got this crowd-source effort to go through every line of it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;At worst, it can be like YouTube&#039;s comment section where it&#039;s sort of like a bathroom in a subway station with all sorts of comments on the wall. Everybody&#039;s completely anonymous. No one has any sense of their reputation within that community, everyone&#039;s a troll.&quot;</div><br />

not too hot and could be a little warmer,&quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who
with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &quot;But
the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket
for the plants.&quot;<br /><br />Pick-your-own strawberries will be $1.20 a
pound at DeGroot&#39;s this year. Whittaker&#39;s strawberries sell for $1.25 a
pound. And at Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Ypsilanti, the cost is $1.46 per
pound, up 3 cents from last year.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45470">From mlive.com again via FreshPlaza</a> on the season in mid-Michigan:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Geri R.

      <p>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.</p><p>The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.</p><p>UPDATE: Two Ann Arbor News stories by Judy McGovern:</p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/some_question_appropriateness.html">Some question appropriateness of mocking e-mail banter during Ann Arbor City Council meetings</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Sent from city e-mail accounts, the messages were released by the city
in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Great Lakes
Environmental Law Center.
</div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The Detroit-based law center was seeking communication about the
city&#39;s planned underground parking structure on Fifth Avenue. What it
got, in addition, were a series of live e-mail exchanges among council
members during three meetings in February and March.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Some
of the messages discuss business on the council&#39;s agenda - such as
whether a vote will be postponed - but more often they spoofed the
proceedings.
<br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/not_all_ann_arbor_city_council.html">Not all Ann Arbor City Council meeting e-mails were horseplay</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition to quietly poking fun at individuals and groups before

e-mail accounts during meetings to discreetly discuss city business.<br /></div><p>I don&#39;t know who all has sent in FOIA requests yet, or what will be printed - the best guess I have at this point is that something will show up in the Sunday paper.&#0160; I&#39;ve seen copies of what is evidently a very selectively edited set of messages from one meeting, in which one member of council sends email to most but not all members of council, awarding a &quot;golden vomit award&quot; to a council member not included on the email.&#0160; Is that teasing, ridicule, or an effort to influence future voting?&#0160; Hard to say.</p><p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act is not clear on the status of email communications as meetings.&#0160; An article in the <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/michigan/open-meetings-laws-michigan">Citizen Media Law Project</a> site says</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
Governmental bodies may hold meetings by by written, telephonic,
electronic, wireless, or other virtual means. However, an electronic
meeting is still subject to the notice requirements and must be held at
a designated place and time. While the law is not certain on this
point, it appears that email communications between members of a
governmental body may constitute a meeting if they involve deliberation
on public business.
</p><p>There&#39;s Open Meetings Act litigation underway in Texas, where the questions of balancing First Amendment rights to speech threaten to change laws across the country.&#0160; I don&#39;t understand all the repercussions, but here&#39;s the story from the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/05/17/0517speech.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> paper:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">It started as a minor prosecution of two Alpine City Council members
accused of discussing city business in private e-mails and not, as
Texas law requires, in a public forum. </p> 
		
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, with a recent U.S. appeals court ruling, the 2004 incident is
mushrooming into a national issue — bringing denunciations from
open-government advocates who fear the decision will cripple laws that
ban elected officials from conducting public business behind closed
doors. </p> 
		
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The controversy surrounds a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
that the Texas Open Meetings Act compromised the Alpine council
members&#39; free speech rights and may have to be overturned or rewritten. </p><p><a href="http://www.bigbendsentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1714&amp;Itemid=1">The Big Bend Sentinel, the local paper for Alpine, TX, notes that this case may reach the Supreme Court</a> based on the intervention of attorney generals from multiple states.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">ALPINE – The recent federal appeals court ruling
in an Alpine Texas Open Meetings Act case that a public official’s
right to free speech is the same as a private citizens may eventually
find its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, an attorney in
the matter said this week.<br /><br />
“Nineteen states have weighed in saying it (the ruling) could change
their open meetings laws,” Alpine attorney Rod Ponton said. “That makes
it a national issue that would need to be decided by the Supreme Court.”<br /> <br />
On April 24, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, Louisiana, reversed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Rob Junell, who initially heard the civil lawsuit
brought by former Alpine City Council members Dr. Avinash Rangra and
Anna Monclova.</p><p>As I noted I expect more on this issue in the Sunday June 7 2009 news.</p>

Davis, executive director of the Freedom of Information Center at the University of Missouri.

<p>“There are many instances out there where public officials are using personal e-mail for public business, mixing and mingling their e-mails with private and public business and using three-way and four-way e-mail conversations to hold quasi-public meetings,” Davis said.</div><br />

Now you can read what they say in private when they should have been listening to public comments and their colleagues conducting council business.  These City Council e-mails were obtained by the Freedom of Information Act.  Read all about it here.</div><br />

The telegrams were sent via the Western Union Telegraph Company, written in code.  The two simply took a number of key words and replaced them with random words, so that the communications would not be made public. They were trying to keep as much of a lid on the strike as they possibly could by doing this.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">California has especially tough rules barring companies from restricting their employees&#039; job hunting. Many companies across the country require employees to sign so-called noncompete agreements, in which the worker agrees not to be hired by a competitor within a certain period of time. But California law generally regards such pacts as unenforceable, said Bob Taylor, a Palo Alto attorney who specializes in antitrust law, among other areas.

<p>As a result, Taylor said, California &quot;is one of, if not the most, difficult states for employers to prevent employees from taking jobs with competitors.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a result, with the success of the Lille line, optical telegraph lines were built over the entirety of France over the next twenty years or so. Napoleon loved the system, having his own portable station built which he carried with him on campaign. He also poured money into building more of the network. It wasn&#039;t cheap, because each station had to be manned by a highly-trained person, who observed the signal from other towers and knew how to pass it on. But the French system of fast communication was one of the key ingredients in France&#039;s success during the Napoleonic War, and so they hung onto it as long as they could. Claude Chappe himself remained in his position as the head of the system for over 30 years, until there was an administration change.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">CLAUDE CHAPPE (1763-1805), French engineer, was born at Brulon (Sarthe) in 1763. He was the inventor of an optical telegraph which was widely used in France until it was superseded by the electric telegraph. His device consisted of an upright post, on the top of which was fastened a transverse bar, while at the ends of the latter two smaller arms moved on pivots. The position of these bars represented words or letters; and by means of machines placed at intervals such that each was distinctly visible from the next, messages could be conveyed through 50 leagues in a quarter of an hour. The machine was adopted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792, and in the following year Chappe was appointed ingenieur-telegraphe; but the originality of his invention was so much questioned that he was seized with melancholia and (it is said) committed suicide at Paris in 1805.   (	(50 leagues) per (quarter hour) = 690 mph</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Buell&#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">The codes did not appear out of nowhere. Their immediate tributaries were nautical and coastal signal systems (typically involving flaghoist combinations), and visual telegraphs such as the Chappé optical telegraph system that operated across France from the mid-1790s well into the 1840s. With all of these systems, each sign or combination of signs represented a word or phrase in a code dictionary.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">It turned out that what I had instead was a commercial telegraphic code. From the 19th through the mid-20th centuries, telegrams were integral to business and personal communications. Telegraph codes proliferated as a way to correspond economically and privately. Readily available code books such as the ABC Universal Commercial Electric Telegraph Code, not to mention many others, were published, with many businesses creating in-house codes. According to telegraphy historian-enthusiast John McVey, “Thousands of codes were published or issued privately, but they are largely forgotten now. They present a finely-grained window into their respective domains and their time. And they provide instances of sometimes stunning visual, technical, lexicographic and unwitting poetic achievement.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Logan&#039;s alternative is nimbly and seductively argued. He shows a map in which the distribution of early settled societies throughout the temperate zone appears exactly to coincide with the geographical spread of the 400-odd species of oak. He cites many cultures - in north America, ancient Mesopotamia, the highlands of Mexico - where a style of living midway between nomadic gathering and rooted agriculture was evident long before the advent of cereal farming. You could, I suppose, call it fixed foraging, the communal exploitation of a long-lived local resource. The resource was the oak tree, always there in one form or another - just above the waterline, if you were fisher-people, just below the uplands if you were hunters. And its first and most fundamental gift was the acorn, prolific, nutritious (you just needed to leach out the tannin with water), storable, cookable.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">To get the tannic acid out of acorns, you need to leech them, that is stick them in boiling water for a few minutes, pour the water out, then repeat repeat repeat perhaps 25 times. Leeching is facilitated if you shell (obviously) the acorns and also chop them into fine pieces. Make sure to cut out any discolored or rotten portions of the nuts, and any grubs (unless you want to eat those too- I can vouch that they aren&#039;t poisonous but I don&#039;t know about the little cells that they build around themselves).</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">The reason I ask this: When I was a child, my grandfather had me pick up a small bucketful of acorns from under our pin oak tree. A day or two later, he asked me to come over to his house and he fed me acorns. The only problem I have is he never told anyone how in the world he prepared them.

<p>Here is some information about eating acorns or rather acorn meal. The tannins have to be removed to avoid the bitterness. I don&#039;t know what your grandfather might have done to remove the tannins in whole acorns unless the type of acorn had less tannins to begin with and could have been removed by soaking the whole acorn.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">It’s a very complicated system. Oaks have “mast” cycles, which means that some years they produce tons of acorns and some years they produce few or none. Our oaks in Michigan do this as well. Mice eat acorns, and not surprisingly, in the New York study mouse numbers are linked to the mast cycles. More acorns, more white-footed mice.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">My friend Katie told me about a recipe she found for making acorn cookies. I’ve been excited to try them and found a recipe and changed it a little last night. The kids and I shaped the acorns, dipped the tops in chocolate, and then rolled them in ground walnuts. I added some finely ground coffee beans in with the walnuts for a coffee/walnut sort of flavor. The kids preferred their cookies just dipped in chocolate. If you have a nut allergy or just don’t like nuts you could try crushed cookies or something similar.</div><br />

      Here's a novel reuse of an old copper mine - the Miner's Revenge bicycle race is using a 1/3 mile long section of the mine no longer in active use as a part of the race course.&nbsp; Bring your own lights - it's dark in there.<br><br><br><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_6Fhs6rvIY4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_6Fhs6rvIY4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="340" width="560"></object>
The race is July 11-12, 2009, with free on-site camping for racers and a bonfire the night before. Greenland is near Ontonagon; the mine is owned by the <a href="http://www.exploringthenorth.com/mine/venture.html">Adventure Mining Company</a> which also does walking tours as well as other more extreme mining adventures that involve rappelling down a mine shaft.

      </h3>
      <p>Kingsley Dennis and John Urry have a new book out, "After The Car".&nbsp; I have a review copy on the way from the publisher; until it arrives, you can see the intro and the index from the Amazon link below.&nbsp; This is an oddly appropriate text to anticipate the week GM went bankrupt.</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Allow me for a brief moment to indulge. I would
like to inform you that my co-authored book titled 'After the Car' has
now been published (finally!), and is currently sitting idly in Amazon.
See - <br>
<iframe marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=superpatron-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0745644228&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<br>Generally
the book is 'academic-ish' and I'm not expecting any of you to buy!
Although concerned with the car the book is also about the 'future' and
addresses issues of a post peak-oil society. If you should feel so
inclined, or know of anyone who might be mildly interested, I would be
happy that you pass on the news. Below is the blurb:<br></div>

<br><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Product Description</strong><br> It is difficult to imagine a world
without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out
to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car
are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car
system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next
few decades. Specifically, the book examines how several major
processes are shaping the future of how we travel, including:<br>• Global warming and its many global consequences<br>• Peaking of oil supplies<br>• Increased digitisation of many aspects of economic and social life<br>• Massive global population increases<br>

The
authors look at changes in technology, policy, economy and society, and
make a convincing argument for a future where, by necessity, the
present car system will be re–designed and re–engineered. Yet the
book also suggests that there are some hugely bleak dilemmas facing the
twenty first century. The authors lay out what they consider to be
possible ‘post–car’ future scenarios. These they describe as ‘local
sustainability’, ‘regional warlordism’ and ‘digital networks of
control’. <br><em>After The Car</em> will be of great interest to
planners, policy makers, social scientists, futurologists, those
working in industry, as well as general readers.<br>Some have
described the 20th Century as the century of the car. Now that century
has come to a close – and things are about to change. <br></div>

      <p>We haven&#39;t scheduled our visit yet to <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/">Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, MI</a>, but as a public service you should know that they are open.&#0160; From the mailing they sent out:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font color="#ff0000"><span class="il">STRAWBERRY</span> SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!!
</font></strong><br /><br />
The first day of the 2009 <span class="il">strawberry</span> season will be Wednesday June 3rd.
<br /><br />
As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&#0160;
ready to pick. If you are looking to pick massive amounts to freeze or
make jam it would be better to wait until they are more plentiful. With
the cool temperatures predicted the berries may not ripen that quickly.
It is advisable to call the farm before you come out to make sure we
are not closed to let them ripen up.
<br /><br />
The price of the berries is $1.46 per pound and we furnish the
containers for free.
<br /><br />
We are open 7 am to 8 pm daily (weather permitting).
<br /><br /></div><p>How did I find out about this, you ask?&#0160; &quot;The List&quot;</p><p class="UpickText blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We at Rowes have been compiling lists of customer
addresses over the years and been sending postcards to our customers
when the strawberry and raspberry seasons are at their peak. Our
strawberry list has over 12,000 addresses and the raspberry list has
over 4,500. Due to rising costs of printing and postage we are no
longer taking addresses for our lists. Instead we have started an email
list. You can sign up for &quot;The List&quot; by sending us an email via the <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/contact.html">Contact Us</a>
page. Once you send us an email the email address you send from will be
added to our new list. This way instead of getting one notice we are
able to send updated information on picking conditions more often,
better serving our customers. If you are on the &quot;old&quot; postcard list it
would be appreciated if you would sign up for the email list and tell
us your street address so we can remove it from the old list. </p><p>12000 strawberry pickers!&#0160; wow.&#0160; you should get on The List if you want more updates.&#0160; I didn&#39;t see any current info on their web site (other than &quot;get on The List&quot;).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.</p><p>Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in.&#0160; You are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat.&#0160; Each experience is essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less dingy, but it&#39;s all of a piece.</p><p>The result then is that I am transported into a new place with this effort, a place where I can write a postcard, read a long-forgotten book, or work within the confines&#0160;of my laptop without the infinite global distraction of the Internet.&#0160; Frankly, the infinite global distraction of the Internet is not conducive to reasonable thought - it demands attention, reply, responsiveness, and engagement, 24/7, whether you want it or not.</p><p>It&#39;s hard, but not impossible, to reconstruct airplane mode in the rest of the day.&#0160; The appropriate cafe can be a part of it, at least for the ritual coffee experience. It helps a lot to have a tool like Freedom (Mac OS X) that enforces a bit of network downtime for you by shutting down all Internet links for a period of time.&#0160; The telephone is&#0160;harder, but almost every call can be made to wait if you plan carefully enough to create a signal for what is actually urgent.</p><p>When I&#39;m offline, I write with different tools, and thus my thinking is different.&#0160; Entering text into &quot;vim&quot;, my old standby favorite text mode editor, triggers different brainwaves that does keying things carefully into a web form.&#0160; Not feeling like I have to hyperlink every third word frees up the brain for internal connections instead of external&#0160;connections.&#0160; There&#39;s rarely a need to hide from flashing distracting advertising or to spend time deleting spam.</p><p>Once upon a time, being online was the exception rather than the rule - some part of my far away brain remembers that and wants to get back to that earlier, simpler day.</p><p>--</p><p>notes afterwards.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/freedom-to-go-o.html">Freedom: previously described here.</a></p><p>a possible answer for using <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/06/use-notepad-vim-or-any-text-editor-with.html">vim as an alternative text editor in firefox</a></p><p>&quot;once upon a time&quot; is roughly the UUCP era, when there was email and netnews but no web and hardly ever any real time communications unless you were all logged into the same machine.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">So with only 5 months until we can harvest fresh rhubarb, we&#039;d better keep eating our canned and frozen rhubarb. I&#039;m going to be taking some of our canned stewed rhubarb to a Michigan Lady Food Bloggers &quot;Summer in January&quot; gathering where we are bringing food that reminds us of summer. However, there are many ways to use rhubarb in savory dishes. Here is a favorite of mine as it combines so many unusual flavors and healthy foods all in one dish! I took it to the last Slow Food book club. There was not much left over, but I was glad to see a little that I could take home to enjoy the next day.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">This is a delicious, unusual and quick brunch that I made for my friend Pat Smith visiting from Ann Arbor, MI. I like the balance between sweet, salt and tart tastes, as did Pat. French toast is something I knew in France as pain perdu or lost bread, I never had it for breakfast until I came to this country. There, it is always served as a dessert and mostly to use  up stale bread. My batter is pretty simple and the secret is in the bread: I use good french sourdough country bread. The duck bacon is of course from d’Artagnan, it’s slight gaminess reveals itself only after the pleasant tartness of the fresh rhubarb. There is no need for extra maple syrup as I sweeten the rhubarb compote with it.</div>

1 1/4 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and a scant 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, mixed together and stir the rhubarb into the mixture. Turn into lined plate, dot with bits of butter, and cover with pastry. Brush the lower edge of paste with water, before putting the upper crust in place, then press the edges together firmly, and brush over again with water. Bake
in a moderate oven until the pastry is well browned.</div>

The crop became so  important that in the late 1940s and early 1950s, an annual Rhubarb Festival was held in Utica, complete with a queen  and her court.  A headline in the Utica Sentinel in October 1953 proclaimed Utica the “Rhubarb Center of the World.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Here&#039;s my recipe for rhubarb pie. Make it with a lattice top, because for some reason, that is what rhubarb pies always have. If you are pie crust phobic, a lattice top is very forgiving. All you need to do is cut your top crust into slices, and lay a row of slices on top of your pie. My favorite trick is to lay the center cross lattice first, weaving over and under. Then place the outboard cross lattices from that center stripe, weaving them opposite of the one next to it.</div>

Consider other sour foods such as lemons, vinegar, sorrel, and sour cream. They make wonderful sweet and sour combinations: lemonade, chutneys, pickles, sweet and sour spareribs, Chinese hot and sour soup. Try substituting rhubarb, either raw, cooked, or as strained juice, in some of these dishes. Why not rhubarbade or rhubarb chutney?</div>

      <p>Herein a recipe for producing what looks like some kind of careful long term reasonable insight into a question, but what is really a coping strategy for the complete inability to be attentive to anything for very long.</p><p>Be distracted away from the thing you are supposed to be doing; that part is pretty easy.&#0160; Wander off randomly into the wilderness of recent changes to the Internet or a random page in your personal knowledge management heap or some long-dusty book in Google Books.&#0160; Note some small fragment of something that isn&#39;t at all relevant to what everyone else seems to be looking at right now but that somehow temporarily holds your interest long enough to compose a few paragraphs with a few links.&#0160; Write about it here; try with desperation to find a category it should already belong to so that it has some illusion of continuity with what you have been doing all along.&#0160; Hit &quot;save&quot;, hit &quot;publish&quot;, and return to the task at hand.</p><p>Scatter your attention all over the Internet to a range of places where recent changes seem to be more predominant.&#0160; Post to Twitter, or Facebook, or your favorite online newspaper&#39;s best reader comments section, or to some seasonally or topically appropriate blog where you know that the author welcomes your readership.&#0160; Be outwardly visible and pay attention to someone else, something else, some place other than yourself.&#0160; Make the rounds of the usual places and hit a few new ones.&#0160; Stop before everyone is asleep.</p><p>Gather up things you have written on a topic, things captured during previous distractions or scattered to the four winds.&#0160; If there is a search engine, search for your own long-forgotten commentary on something, and collect it back to somewhere central.&#0160; If all you have is paper, leaf through it steadily and methodically until inevitably that journal yields a relevant fragment.&#0160;&#0160; Pile up the fragments, enumerate them, list them out carefully as though they were bits of papyrus needing careful reassembly.&#0160; See what you might have known in the past and re-know it, relearn it.</p><p>Then, when all of the distract-scatter-gather process has all been put into motion, can you focus on that one thing you have been getting ready to do all this time.&#0160; Come back to what you have gathered up and re-assess the work as a whole.&#0160; Allow yourself to work methodically through the work you have gathered together, to pull it apart, to see what the whole set looks like and not just little bits of it.&#0160;&#0160; Pull through everything that is relevant and stitch it all together into something new, something that lasts longer than a simple short distraction but that hold and sustain a concentrated narrative with examples and ideas and themes and notions pulled out from a long time.</p><p>The whole process should run on some cycle appropriate for the task or the season.&#0160; As I write, I think about the quarterly holiday of Discardia, where you celebrate letting go, and of all of the distracted and scattered thinking I have about that event that culminates in an every three months deliberate effort to tidy things up.&#0160; The collected effort of pulling things together means not only that you have everything in mind but also that you can free yourself of the distractions that eventually got you here - and that you get, periodically, a chance to edit out some randomness and make it look like you are more organized and orderly than your easily-distracted nature would allow.</p><p>This season&#39;s Discardia holiday is coming up on June 20-22, 2009.</p>

      <p>Today is a Twitter conference, so Twitter is full of good stuff people have been saving up.&#0160; Here&#39;s one: a &quot;conversation prism&quot; in bright happy colors showing a set of categories of tools, and how each one of them is occupied by some set of applications.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mapping of each of them onto the set of tools that I am using to keep a2b3 loosely connected.&#0160;
Sorry no links, didn&#39;t have time to hyperlink everything <a href="http://theconversationprism.com" title="The Conversation Prism by Brian Solis and Jesse Thomas"><img src="http://theconversationprism.com/convoprismembed.jpg" style="border: 0px solid #666666;" /></a></p><p>The Conversation Prism by <a href="http://briansolis.com">Brian Solis</a> and <a href="http://jess3.com">Jesse Thomas</a></p>
<br /><p><br />Forums: Yahoo Groups</p><p>This is the biggest single tool I use for group continuity; it perhaps reflects my elderly nature that email is the first system rather than web-based forums or modern social networks.&#0160; All I can say in my defense is that Usenet would have been better but it&#39;s really not available, and that I have 10 years of continuous use into Yahoo Groups and they haven&#39;t ruined it (yet).</p><p>Social networks: Facebook (intermittently)</p><p>Facebook will show up here frequently, if only because it&#39;s ubiquitous and because Ann Arbor is full of people who use it.&#0160; My sense is that its group tools are way weaker than its personal tools and so it&#39;s best used as an adjunct to the main Yahoo group just so you can attach names to faces and so you can promote events.</p><p>&quot;Interest and curated networks&quot; (?): LinkedIn</p><p>I&#39;m not sure about the category, but LinkedIn certainly qualifies as one ongoing conversation starting and continuing tool.&#0160; Like Facebook, groups are second class objects in LinkedIn, and thus it&#39;s weak at building cohesion.&#0160; On the plus side you don&#39;t have to pretend to be someone&#39;s pal to look up their resume.</p><p>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</p><p>There are a bunch of national scale review sites, but nothing beats asking a good sized group of your peers for recommendations on everything from programming language libraries to pest control.&#0160; To whatever extent possible, Arborwiki becomes the public long term storage for what would otherwise be something ephemeral and hard to retrieve through the Yahoo Groups search interface.</p><p>Location: none; I gave up on Plaxo when it creeped me out</p><p>Location-based mobile services are supposed to be the future of the social mobile web, but I lived through having my location visible on Plaxo and decided against living that way when people who knew where I was without me telling them didn&#39;t have the social clues not to be obvious that they were watching me.&#0160;&#0160; If I want to tell you where I am I&#39;ll be explicit about it on Twitter, or you can just wonder.</p><p>Video: whatever people use</p><p>There are a couple of filmmakers in the group, and I respect their judgement what to use for video.&#0160; None of the video tools have strong group membership characteristics - or even particularly weak ones - so I treat them all pretty much interchangably as dumb hosting.&#0160; (And no, I don&#39;t particular care if any given short video clip goes viral.)</p><p>Customer Service: Get Satisfaction, but it&#39;s not quite right</p><p>If a2b3 was a business it might need customer support, but it&#39;s not, and Get Satisfaction is just extra baggage.&#0160; Tried it, it seemed to be functional, but not for the problem at hand.</p><p>Documents/Content: SlideShare seems to be a favorite</p><p>Those people who are giving presentations seem to have settled on SlideShare as a common denominator for hosting.&#0160; The weekly lunches don&#39;t feature presentations so there&#39;s no natural synchronization around it as a tool, but it works as advertised.</p><p>Events: upcoming, Facebook events, in-person lunch w/announcements</p><p>Events are perhaps the hardest nut to crack, the thing that would make you spend all week promoting other people&#39;s work and the like.&#0160; I have been telling people who don&#39;t have URLs for events to post them to upcoming; Facebook will tell you about more parties than you can manage to go to; and there&#39;s nothing like someone telling you about something around the table.&#0160; The only way to really lick the events question is to have someone full time collecting them.</p><p>Music: One each of everything; I&#39;m fond of how blip.fm twitters out songs</p><p>blip.fm is the closest thing to Napster that&#39;s out there; do a Twitter search for your favorite artist plus the word &quot;blip&quot; and you may be lucky enough to find a fellow fan and a track you can listen to.&#0160;&#0160; YouTube is also really good for songs - my 4 y/o calls it &quot;picture music&quot;.</p><p>Wiki: Arborwiki, plus my own private Socialtext space</p><p>Arborwiki is the designated spot for dropping in information that deserves to live in a wiki; the &quot;Birthday Deals&quot; page there is the one universal attraction point around which much of the rest lives.&#0160; I keep a Socialtext private wiki for my own personal memory augmentation tool, in part because it works awesomely on my Blackberry.</p><p>Livecasting video: haven&#39;t done it yet, not appropriate for lunch</p><p>If you want to join in to lunch, you don&#39;t want to watch it remotely; the space isn&#39;t set up for that.&#0160; If and when I get to a place where regular live video streaming makes sense I&#39;ll use whatever the cool kids are using then.</p><p>Pictures: Flickr, Facebook photos</p><p>Once upon a time Flickr was a dynamic photo community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly creative people who you really wanted to share pictures with.&#0160; Then everything grew up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and my camera died.&#0160; Now if I want to share a photo I&#39;m more likely to put it on Facebook.&#0160; I miss the old Flickr.</p><p>Social bookmarks: Delicious, plus whatever Les is working on</p><p>Once upon a time Delicious was a dynamic bookmark community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly smart people who you really wanted to share bookmarks with.&#0160; Then everything group up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and Twitter came along.&#0160; Now if I want to share a link I think twice and either twitter it out or work it into a longer blog post.&#0160; I just hope my 10,000 bookmarks stick around for a long time.</p><p>Comment and reputation: plenty of that around the lunch table</p><p>There&#39;s enough people who I care to converse with that I know by face and name that the level of comment-tracking promoted by blog tools seems irrelevant, for the most part, or at least too much work.</p><p>Crowdsourced content: arborwiki, a2geeks</p><p>Both arborwiki and a2geeks have enough of a wiki platform running for general and for technical info that if you need to crowdsource something there&#39;s a place to point people toward to edit things.</p><p>Collaboration: Google Spreadsheets (for football parking info)</p><p>If I need to collect a bunch of numbers from a bunch of people, Google Spreadsheets seems to do pretty well.&#0160; I love wiki for private collaboration, but you have to be collaborating with people who love it too.&#0160; Otherwise, printing things out and letting someone else wrestle with tracking changes in Microsoft Word is about as good as I get.</p><p>Blog platforms: Typepad</p><p>Someone else worries about it and I just hit &quot;post&quot;.</p><p>Blogs/conversations: Google Blog Search is the best of a bad lot</p><p>It&#39;s hard to track conversations in blogs, in part because the blog vs comment distinction is weird.&#0160; It&#39;s just as easy to do regular Google searches and put in teh word &quot;blog&quot; as an added qualifier.</p><p>Blog communities: mybloglog</p><p>I&#39;m using this mostly for stats and to detect one-day spikes that mean that some seasonal post is current again or to notice when something is on fire.</p><p>Micromedia: Twitter</p><p>twitter, duh.&#0160; </p><p>Twitter ecosystems: trying out Cotweet</p><p>I have a beta account; it&#39;s working pretty well to do future scheduled postings and to better track responses.&#0160; Not sure yet if and how to open up the @a2b3 account to multiple posters but that&#39;s the next obvious thing.</p><p>SMS/Voice: Google Voice</p><p>It converts voice mail to text so that I don&#39;t have to listen to all of my voice mail.&#0160; Still in closed beta.</p><p>Lifestreams: get a life!&#0160; need some privacy sometime</p><p>Part of living a life is deciding what to broadcast to the Internet and what to keep quiet.&#0160; I&#39;m just as happy to be offline as online, and the idea that you should soulcast every last mood swing seems to be as unproductive as it gets</p><p>----</p><p>After working my way through this, I realize what it&#39;s missing - all of these apps I write about are apps that work on a big screen.&#0160; The real conversation prism also includes a parallel set of augmented reality supported by mobile devices, and that very well may include entirely new categories than above.</p>

      <p>The Capital Press is an agricultural journal for the Western US.&#0160; I search it from time to time to get blueberry crop information.&#0160; Here&#39;s a latest <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/main.asp?SectionID=67&amp;SubSectionID=619&amp;ArticleID=51520&amp;TM=84492.1"><strong>Oregon blueberry assessment cap altered downward</strong></a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="mailto:mlies@capitalpress.com"><span color="#000000" size="1;" style="font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF"><strong>Mitch Lies</strong></span></a><br /><span color="#000000" size="1;" style="font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF"><strong>Capital Press</strong></span><br /><br /><font color="#000000" face="ARIAL, SANS SERIF" size="2">SALEM

said Carlos Garcia Salazar, a small fruit specialist for <a href="http://web1.msue.msu.edu/fruit/bluberry.htm">Michigan State
Extension Service</a>&#39;s Ottawa County office. That&#39;s about double the
normal amount for this time of year.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="more"></a></div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Fresh blueberry prices were above $2 per pound in
2007 and 2008, but this year they will be closer to $1.30 a pound. A
pound of processed blueberries could drop from $1.63 to below $1.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We had bonanza for three or four years,&quot; Salazar said. &quot;But that&#39;s over.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We believe that given our holdings and storage some are estimating prices similar to five or six years ago.&quot;</p><p>One possible direction for this surplus of blueberries is increased use as a dried fruit, in addition to fresh and frozen.&#0160; <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/05/graceland_fruit_is_a_dried_and.html">The Kalamazoo Gazette writes about Graceland Fruit</a>, which has innovated in creating cherry and blueberry &quot;raisins&quot;</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We&#39;re starting to see a very significant increase in dried
blueberries,&quot; said Frank Bragg, chief executive of <a href="http://www.blueberries.com/">MBG Marketing</a>, a
multi-state blueberry cooperative based in Grand Junction, near South
Haven.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Today, 10 to 15 percent of processed blueberries are dried. That&#39;s up from about 5 percent two years ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">A quarter of North America&#39;s blueberry crop comes from a four-county

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a thought experiment for you.&#0160; (See what people are saying: google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vielmetti+mobile+identity">mobile identity</a> , twitter search <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=mobile+identity">mobile identity</a> )</p><p>You&#39;re waiting to meet someone who you don&#39;t know very well, and you have a few minutes with your cell phone to do a little bit of searching or browsing to see what might be useful to know.&#0160; If you have one social mobile site to look at, which would it be?&#0160; And when the meeting is over, where do you jot down that note to self to remind you for the next visit?</p><p>Some possibilities:</p><p><a href="http://m.facebook.com">Mobile facebook.</a>&#0160; If you&#39;re frends already, this works pretty well, as long as your correspondent is keeping up appearances.&#0160; This is pretty much an all or nothing question.</p><p>Mobile Google search.&#0160; This works pretty well if the person you&#39;re talking to has a distinguished name, but not everyone does.&#0160; The results are an absolute mixed bag and vary wildly depending on how much personal SEO someone does and how lucky you are with Google mobile-izing the results.</p><p><a href="http://m.linkedin.com">Mobile LinkedIn</a>.&#0160; Dry as dust, this won&#39;t even get you someone&#39;s picture so that you know you have the right person; suitable for background employment history, so I guess if you&#39;re doing impromptu interviews it might be a good part of your mobile arsenal.</p><p><a href="http://m.twitter.com">Mobile Twitter.</a>&#0160; That person you&#39;re about to meet, did they have a peanut butter sandwich for dinner last night, so you can avoid suggesting one again?&#0160; This is perhaps the most open ended resource to tap into if someone is on Twitter, since it&#39;s plausible to believe that you might be able to get a message through that they&#39;d see.</p><p>Mobile Gmail search.&#0160; If you have had a bunch of correspondence with someone and you use Gmail, one plausible tactic is simply to plow through your old inbox and unearth some conversation from the past to bring up again.&#0160; Results may vary but it&#39;s a much more personal search than any of the others.</p><p>Mobile Flickr.&#0160; Is your friend a photographer?&#0160; Look at their photo stream, it&#39;s like a personal channel into their life.&#0160; This only works if you know there&#39;s photos to see.</p><p>Mobile wiki.&#0160; If you, like me, are one of the odd people who keeps a personal wiki, then you can search through it and see if there&#39;s some wiki note-to-self that you wrote that triggers a memory or association.&#0160; There&#39;s a variety of similar memory augmentation tools that fill a niche that was once called a &quot;personal information manager&quot;, and the right ones of these offer a jumping off point for reflection or memory or jotting down a few notes.</p><p>Mobile address book.&#0160; If your address book on your mobile phone or web-based call manager has a notes field, you might have written down a few things or a lot of things that you want to remember for that next conversation.&#0160; Most of these that I&#39;ve seen are pathetic fixed-length field plain text databases with no inter-contact linking and very weak group management, but you might have worked around something&#39;s limitations to make it your own.</p><p>The overall complaint I have about all of these is that nothing does an awesome job of being the everything-spot to look up a few notes before an impromptu meeting and to jot down a few notes afterwards.&#0160;&#0160; As a rule, the web-based stuff is weak on being a launching point for phone calls, the phone-based stuff is weak on web services, and the social networks aren&#39;t private enough.&#0160; At some point you just want to carry around a little black address book and write things discreetly in pencil.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On Thursday May 22 I had lunch with the a2b3 group for the 183d time.&#0160; I&#39;m writing that down as though it was a perfectly accurate number, just so that next week I can look it up and say that it will be the 184th time.</p><p>Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.&#0160; This week it felt like Groundhog Day, where I was the Bill Murray character practicing piano lessons over and over again until I really was the person who was good at hosting lunch for 30 instead of someone wondering whether I could pull off hosting lunch more than once.</p><p>It was a quiet week in Ann Arbor, my home town, where Garrison Keillor comes to do his Prairie Home Companion every once in a while at lovely Hill Auditorium, though he didn&#39;t come this week and won&#39;t come next week but he might show up at any moment, making you think that he was just a voice from the radio even though you could see him on stage.&#0160; Ann Arbor is still the third or fourth best city in the nation for any number of things that you could measure, and if anyone wants to put together the convincing statistic that ranks this town in the best in the nation for bi bim bap I am certain that our civic leaders can devise the numerator and demoninator for the metric that proves it.&#0160; And we&#39;re justly proud of our long civic history of providing parking structures for all of the cars of all of the vistors who come to our charming town to experience its pedestrian charms.</p><p>Every week, after I give a short speech, I ask a question.&#0160; Some of them are great questions, and some of them are ordinary questions, and mostly they give the lunch patron a chance to say something about themselves that doesn&#39;t depend on the &quot;what do you do for a living&quot; answer because when you are free for lunch sometimes that is because you are in a career transition and your sense of personal identity that used to be wrapped up in your job is cut adrift.&#0160; No one needs to be put on the spot that way, so the lunch question admits a certain ambiguity about your day job.</p><p>People introduce themselves, say a few words, and hand the microphone on.&#0160; We started using a microphone because the table seats 35 and it&#39;s the entire length of the restaurant.&#0160; The people who come back again and again sometimes get good at describing who they are in a few words that can be repeated faithfully by anyone else who is similarly a regular.&#0160; The question is almost always optional, and people are always free to ask their own question or to ask for assistance from the group from some problem, thorny and pressing or trivial and mundane; generally the specific answers wait until afterwards when people talk among themselves again.</p><p>I try to introduce the whole table by 1 pm so people can move to the next thing they need to do.&#0160; It has been a remarkable crowd for many reasons, not the least of which is the wide variety in ages of the people at the table, ranging this week from just out of high school to nearly retired.&#0160; It&#39;s a special design of no specific purpose that you need to get a diverse crowd - by not having a clear cut agenda, you make it possible to let pretty much any person who shows up be the right person to arrive.</p><p>At the end there is some attempt to organize information about upcoming events, either meetings of other groups that organize regularly, or one time events that someone is planning.&#0160; </p><p>With the routine as established as it is, and with enough people knowing what to expect and how to work within the time boundaries that are the only real fixed limits, it&#39;s been possible for me not to show up and not to announce that the event is happening and have everything go pretty much the same as if I were there.&#0160; </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Google search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=black+river+falls+michigan+fire+map">black river falls michigan fire map</a></p>

<p>Twitter search: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=black%20river%20falls">black river falls</a></p>

<p>As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&nbsp; It's not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there's a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.</p>

<p>When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.&nbsp; I'm hoping to collect some of that same level of detail here.&nbsp; It's always a big concern when forests burn, especially when they burn uncontrolled in land that doesn't have a lot of roads in it.</p>

<p>Here's some details I've been able to figure out so far.</p>

<p>The Yooper Daily blog from Shawn and Brian Malone, commercial photographers, has a post titled simply <a href="http://yooperdaily.blogspot.com/2009/05/wildfires-break-out-in-up.html">Wildfires Break Out In UP.</a> They have an approximate map of the Black River Falls fire which shows it deep in the woods of Ely Township. </p>

<p>A lot of my searches go to another fire called the <a href="http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3321">Black River Falls fire, but in Jackson County Wisconsin;</a> this historical marker describes a 1977 fire, the traces of which are almost gone by now with timber regrowth.</p>

<p>The Remote Sensing Applications Center of the USDA Forest Service has a series of maps, including this <a href="http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/activefiremaps.php?op=maps&rCode=enm">Northern Midwest fire map</a> (Northern Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin).&nbsp; The current one I'm looking at shows the Pinery Fire near L'Anse, MI, but nothing from the Black River Falls fire. The scale on this is fairly large, so it doesn't pin down the precise acreage, just the nearest town.</p>

<p><img  src="file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;<img  src="file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="">For a more detailed map you turn to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr">Michigan DNR</a>, which is preparing maps for active fire fighting. This sample shows the extent of the fire as of last update, though it doesn't have a date on the map, the file date is 20090521 (may 21, 2009).&nbsp; <a style="display: inline;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b image-full " alt="Picture 2" title="Picture 2" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-800wi" border="0"></a> 
</p>

<br><p>I'm stopping here because this is what I started looking for, and you'll want to stay tuned to whatever other news sources you have if you're close to the fire.</p>

<p>On twitter I notice updates from <a href="http://twitter.com/MDNR">@MDNR</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wluctv6">@wluctv6</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/miningjournal">@miningjournal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nortman">@nortman</a> and expect to collect more.&nbsp; It's worth noting that the Mining Journal has extremely terse 60 character headlines on Twitter which means that typical keyword style searches don't find them very well, though once you do find their news stream the writing and reporting is first rate, and they have <a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/527617.html">interviews of people at the Red Cross shelter at Westwood High School</a> which is quite evidently information central for families affected by the blaze. </p>

<blockquote>
ISHPEMING - Sandwiches, coffee, donuts, cots to sleep on - the American Red Cross shelter, set up at the Westwood High School gym, was ready to fill the needs of residents evacuated due to the Black River Falls fire off Marquette County Road 581.

The thing the evacuees were wanting most, however, was news about the fire.

Of the 300 people who passed through the shelter Wednesday, the vast majority wanted news about their homes and neighbors, said Red Cross Executive Director Kayla West.

"They wanted information more than anything," she said.

      </h3>
      <p>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&#39;re better than me.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.westsidefarmersmarket.com/">Westside Farmers Market</a>, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&#0160; </p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ann Arbor&#39;s Westside Farmers&#39; Market is currently &quot;on hold&quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor.</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/zoning_violation_shuts_down_an.html">The Ann Arbor News story by Judy McGovern reads</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The property&#39;s C3 zoning is the most relaxed of the three commercial categories, but it doesn&#39;t allow the kind of &quot;special use&quot; permits that can be issued to properties in the more restrictive C1 and C2 categories.<br /><br />That appears to be an oversight in the regulations, and city officials are working to change the code, said City Council Member Carsten Hohnke, whose 5th Ward includes the property.<br /><br /></div><p>I read through <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Ordinances/Pages/Online%20City%20Code.aspx">city code</a>; it appears that C3 zoning (5:10.23) for the properly in question is preferential to properties where automotive access is the characteristic function:</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="blockquote l0" style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">Intent.</span>&#0160;
			<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">The
design and regulations of this district are set up to provide for
certain types of commercial activities which have characteristics in
common. In this district, the customer usually comes directly to the
particular establishment by automobile, making a separate stop for each
errand. Comparison shopping activity is less than in the central
business district. Since there is little essential interdependence of
activities, establishments can be dispersed over considerable areas
with each establishment having its own automobile parking. Good
automobile accessibility is essential to these districts. The uses
permitted, because of their lack of intense pedestrian activity and
their required contact with auto access, would be incompatible in the
central business district.</span>&#0160;
			</div>
</div><p><br />The get-out-of-jail-free card is this language on special use permits, as described in the C-1 Local Business District language (5.10.15):</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="l1 blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">(h)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;The City Council may, by resolution, designate
certain dates and locations as special events temporary outdoor sales
areas. Said resolution shall include conditions and standards of
conduct to be in force for outdoor sales and displays on private
property. A property owner who wishes to conduct outdoor sales and
displays on his or her private property, as provided for in the council
resolution, shall first apply for and receive a Zoning Compliance
Permit by the date designated in the resolution. The conditions and
standards contained in the resolution shall be conditions of the Zoning
Compliance Permit issued to a property owner. Failure to comply with
the conditions set in the resolution shall be a violation of this
ordinance section and shall be grounds to revoke all permits granted to
the property owner for the duration of the special event identified in
the resolution.</div>
</div><p><br />The question, is appears, is whether the C-1 &quot;special events&quot; language applies to C-3 zoning, or whether there is no permit possible for someone in the automotive, big box, strip mall and huge parking lot district to ever do a temporary outdoor sales area.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>Given that Zingerman&#39;s had a previous permit for this use I suspect there&#39;s some other story not yet being told.&#0160; Your guess is as good as mine what prompted this whole snafu.&#0160; <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/04/development_dirt_dda_drug_stor.html">Zingerman&#39;s has had disputes with the city about their 322 E Kingsley property&#39;s zoning</a> , which have come to council recently.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-crisis-informatics-or-the-study-of-community-emergency-response/">crisis informatics, or the study of community emergency response</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The &quot;<a href="http://google.com/search?q=crisis+informatics">crisis informatics</a>&quot; (Google search) term is new to me, but the research I&#39;ve been able to find under that term is familiar.&#0160; Faced with an unexpected crisis situation that is bigger than what the mainstream media and existing government organizations can easily manage the news flow from, how do communities response in emergency situations with social media and with ad hoc emergency response systems?</p>
<p>Without going into lots of detail I do want to share one recent paper that caught my eye, via Leysia Palen: <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Epalen/Papers/iscram08/BackchannelsISCRAM08.pdf">Backchannels on the Front Lines: Emergent Uses of Social Media in the 2007 Southern California Wildfires.</a></p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Opportunities for participation by members of the public are expanding the information arena of disaster.&#0160; Social media supports “backchannel” communications, allowing for wide-scale interaction that can be collectively resourceful, self-policing, and generative of information that is otherwise hard to obtain. Results from our study of information practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires suggest that community information resources and other backchannel communications activity enabled by social media are gaining prominence in the disaster arena, despite concern by officials about the legitimacy of information shared through such means. We argue that these emergent uses of social media are pre-cursors of broader future changes to the institutional and organizational arrangements of disaster response. </div>
<p><br />The term &quot;crisis informatics&quot; is credited to Christine Hagar (2006).&#0160; If you do a proper retrospective look at the phenomenon without that term, you unearth previous discussion of the use of the net for responses in the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes, hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and various power outages and ice storms.&#0160; A proper retrospective bibliography awaits someone else&#39;s project.</p>
