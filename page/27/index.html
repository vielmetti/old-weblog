<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&#39;m working on upper right.</p>
<p>The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little hurt by making the sidebars full of white space, but not much. My paper notebooks have lots of marginalia, but they are marginalia that change with every page, and a lot of it is sidebar note-to-self rather than publishable anything. Still, the pages load <strong><em>a lot faster</em></strong> when they don&#39;t have quite so much crap on them, and I haven&#39;t even started to explore adding more stuff at the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typepad.com" target="_self">Typepad</a> is particularly good as a place to play with designs, they have a lot of premade ones that look much better than anything I would cobble together on my own (see e.g. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html" target="_self">this early effort</a> which I wrote in vi, which is probably where I&#39;d start from if left to my own devices).</p>
<p>Pages load a lot faster. Zoom! And that alone is worthwhile to do a redesign for.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some will say that you should schedule your posts or tweets for a certain particular time of day, when it&#39;s scientifically proven (by data scientists) that you&#39;ll get the maximum number of page views or retweets or some other measure of progress. (Bitly says <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/05/09/best-time-to-post-on-facebook/" target="_self">Monday between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern is good</a>.)</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#39;s true, but here&#39;s the argument for posting now rather than scheduling into the near future. If you have scheduled posts, you have to perpetually be on the alert for breaking news that will make your pre-planned messaging look inappropriate or off-key. You&#39;re also giving up any chance to engage in a spontaneous one on one conversation with someone who is listening right now.</p>
<p>Do you have something to say? Say it now. There&#39;s always going to be an opportunity to repeat yourself at the optimum time, and if it&#39;s good enough, you can repeat yourself over and over again. (Repetition is the very soul of the net.) Don&#39;t get so hung up on laser-targeted optimization that you miss the essence of the network as an ongoing conversation.</p>

</div>
In Wikipedia, every article is measured against a broad global sense of &quot;notability&quot;. An individual or a topic has to be notable and newsworthy enough to be included, and though the standards vary there is some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTABILITY" target="_self">global consensus to what it means</a>. If an article doesn&#39;t meet the grade, it&#39;s subject to deletion.
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>On a <a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a>, every article is measured against an individual sense of &quot;locality&quot;. An individual or topic has to be relevant to that location that is being covered. Standards vary widely, but the general feeling I get is that if you put the subject&#39;s dot on a map and the dot is too far from the center of gravity of the Localwiki, it will be rejected.</p>
<p>This gives curious and interesting results. It means that the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Great_Shanghai_Restaurant" target="_self">closing of an otherwise un-notable buffet restaurant in a strip mall</a> is notable enough for a Localwiki simply because it&#39;s local, but also that people making worldwide headlines don&#39;t have a place in a Localwiki (unless of course they have some particular and peculiar tie to a single location).&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself wishing that more places had local wikis - the process of editing is much less demanding when you simply need to identify that something is of local interest vs. going up against the global test. And locality is still ambiguous, but not so much as to be impossible to gauge.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-21-runtastic-and-cardiotrainer-for-android-a-brief-review/">Runtastic and Cardiotrainer for Android, a brief review</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Runtastic is a workout tracking program for Android. It lets you keep track of where you have gone on your run, bike ride, or walk (or a bunch of other means of locomotion) and using the GPS in the phone makes some estimate of how far you&#39;ve gone and how much effort you have expended.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also used Cardiotrainer for this purpose, which has a similar reason for being.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really handy to have your device track where you go so that you get a nice map of your journey. Those trips where you&#39;re trying to find your way through an unfamiliar neighborhood generate a trail of breadcrumbs you can follow, and it&#39;s really helpful to have a good sense for how far away a mile is while walking. (For me, it&#39;s a mile to the Michigan Union.)</p>
<p>Both Runtastic and Cardiotrainer have a synthesized voice to give you details of your progress as you go. Runtastic is rather more sparing in its narration, which I find just fine. Both systems allow you to log your progress to a variety of online media like Facebook.</p>
<p>I started out using Cardiotrainer, and it wanted me to log a trip every day and keep track of myself. When I used to wear a pedometer, that was really easy to do, and I could type in a few numbers every few days and feel like I was keeping up with myself. It doesn&#39;t make sense to have any of these running all the time, and so I was fine with Runtastic keeping that detail in the background for me rather than the foreground.</p>
<p>Runtastic also has a feature, as of yet incompletely tested, that lets you know where your friends are right now on the map. That&#39;s actually the feature I want more than any to test out, because it points to the possibility that you could use this for something even a little more like a real time channel for careful coordination of where people are and what they&#39;re doing. I&#39;m imagining getting lost and having this be helpful.</p>

<p>Cardiotrainer:&#0160;<a href="http://www.worksmartlabs.com/cardiotrainer/about.php" target="_self">http://www.worksmartlabs.com/cardiotrainer/about.php</a></p>
<p>Both apps are free, and both have Pro or Paid versions that unlock a few more features.</p>

Microsoft and Nokia don&#39;t appear to know about that path, just illustrating some of the perils of computing walking directions in an urban environment.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From the Bitcointalk forums, 2011: &quot;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=19392.0" target="_self">Bitcoins are peacock tails</a>&quot;</p>
<p><em>A series of studies, &quot;Peacocks, Porsches and Thorstein Veblen: Conspicuous Consumption as a Sexual Signaling System,&quot; was published recently in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&#0160;A peacock&#39;s tail is beautiful: magnificent plumage, iridescent colors. Alas, it is also wasteful. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to develop. Sound like bitcoins?</em></p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the Bitcoin as a signal of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22153687" target="_self">BBC reports, quoting Blockchain</a>, that current Bitcoin miners are consuming $147,000 per day in electricity, and generating $681,000 in profiles from the mining. That doesn&#39;t count any of the investment in hardware for Bitcoin mining rigs, which has its own embedded hardware and energy cost.</p>
<p>That you get a Bitcoin as a result of burning energy and setting up equipment is a perfect signal (for those who are tuned into it) that you have the technical skills and cash resources to create some new token of value. It&#39;s valuable to the extent that it&#39;s difficult to create, and if you don&#39;t have the patience to create it, you can buy them up for cash <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2013/0412/Winklevoss-twins-try-to-buy-up-bitcoin-market" target="_self">like the Winkelvoss twins are said to have done</a>.</p>
<p>Now to quote my favorite cranky Norwegian immigrant economist, <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902veblen00.asp" target="_self">Thorstein Veblen (1902):</a></p>
<p><em>Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer&#39;s good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities. In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.</em></p>
<p>Bitcoins are almost the perfect expression of conspicuous waste, and in a benefit that Veblen might not have guessed at, they are liquid in a peculiar way such that it&#39;s impossible to distinguish between someone who has purchased them vs. someone who has a mining rig going full bore creating them. How peculiar a commodity to have no intrinsic value that&#39;s obvious right now, but that is a perfect signal either that you have consumed a lot of energy or a lot of money to have acquired them. In this sense they look like they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_self">Veblen goods</a>, where they are more in demand depending on them being more expensive.</p>

      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner_battery_problems" target="_self">The Boeing 787 fleet was grounded because of battery problems.</a> The FAA has recently approved engineering fixes to their battery system, and the planes will be back in the air perhaps within weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/20/business/faa-endorses-boeing-remedy-for-787-battery.html?pagewanted=all" target="_self">From the New York Times:</a></p>
<p><em>Boeing’s fixes include better insulation for the batteries’ eight cells, and a stainless steel box designed to encase the batteries and contain fire and vent possible smoke or hazardous gases out of the planes. Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s chief engineer for the 787, said that the tests performed in the last month showed the batteries were now much less likely to overheat.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-boeing-dreamliner-idUSBRE92E02D20130315" target="_self">Reuters</a>:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=BA.N&amp;lc=int_mb_1001">Boeing</a>, which has Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to test its new battery for certification, said Friday it will encase the redesigned power pack in a&#0160;steel&#0160;box, pack it with added insulation, heat-resistant material and spacers, drill drain holes to remove moisture, and vent any gases from overheating directly to the atmosphere outside the aircraft.</em></p>
<p>Note that neither of these accounts describe changes to the battery cells themselves, just the packaging of the cells within the power pack.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year on Earth Day I do a ritual weeding of our back yard garden and pick whatever garlic mustard I can find. We&#39;ve been thinning out the garlic mustard every year for years and so it&#39;s mostly in check but it&#39;s always worth pulling a few more plants.</p>
<p>Aside from putting the garlic mustard in the municipal compost - not your own compost - there&#39;s always a temptation to eat at least some of what gets pulled. The challenge is making sure that you cook the garlic mustard so that the yucky compounds that make it indigestable get cooked out. Even though the leaves are so tender that you don&#39;t really need to cook them very much, it&#39;s recommended to cook garlic mustard in two changes of water to leach out the bad parts.</p>
<p>The Three Foragers have a recipe for &quot;<a href="http://the3foragers.blogspot.com/2012/04/garlic-mustard-recipe-garlic-mustard.html" target="_self">Garlic Mustard Roulade</a>&quot; which looks mighty fancy, but they also have good suggestions for handling this spring green. As they note, &quot;Garlic mustard might not be for everyone, but it is nutritious, highly invasive and easily gathered in&#0160;quantity.&quot;&#0160;</p>

<p> 
Now that the taxes are done, do the other paperwork you’ve been putting off! 
</p>
<p>
National Healthcare Decisions Day highlights the importance of advance healthcare decision-making.  As a participating organization, After Death Home Care is providing information and tools for the public to talk about their wishes with family, friends and healthcare providers, and execute written advance directives in accordance with Michigan laws.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, on April 16, from 6:30 – 8:30 pm, After Death Home Care is welcoming the public with information about advance care planning and advance directive forms. Merilynne Rush, RN, Natural Burial Specialist is joined by Patricia Lyndale, UM Hospital Chaplain, and John Erdevig, Attorney, to answer questions.
</p>
<p> 
National Healthcare Decisions Day encourages people in our community to have thoughtful conversations about their healthcare decisions and to complete reliable advance directives to make their wishes known.  As a result, more people will plan ahead before a health crisis, fewer families and healthcare providers will have to struggle with making difficult decisions when a patient can no longer do so, and more families will be able to honor their loved ones wishes.

<p>April 11, 2013</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues and AAPS Families:
</p>
<p>Last evening, I gave President Deb Mexicotte a letter in which I asked her to 
accept my resignation as Superintendent of Schools of the Ann Arbor Public 
Schools, effective 90 days from yesterday. I shared with her that I plan to 
retire during the summer after 43 years as a professional educator in public 
education. I have been blessed to have truly enjoyed my 43-year career and I 
thanked her and the Board for the opportunity to serve the Ann Arbor 
community during these past two years.
</p>
<p>To all my colleagues in Ann Arbor Public Schools, it has been a privilege to 
work with you and I wish you well as you continue to maintain the highest 
of standards for all of our children in the future. Ann Arbor is truly an 
outstanding school district with so many dedicated staff members who care 
enormously about children. Your commitment and dedication are beyond 
compare! 
</p>
<p>As I retire, I hope to do some reflective writing about my many experiences 
in education, do some traveling, and reconnect with family and friends who I 
have neglected over the years!
</p>
<p>Thank you to you all!
</p>
<p>Patricia P. Green, Ph.D.
</p>
<p>Superintendent of Schools

      <p><p>The book is my&#0160;<a href="https://leanpub.com/michigan-foia" target="_self">No-Nonsense Guide to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a>, which I&#39;m publishing (early) and updating (as its written) <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/writing-and-publishing-early-with-leanpub.html" target="_self">using Leanpub</a>. Here&#39;s what I sent out to subscribers - all four of them! - this morning.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to have a chance to keep working on this, since even the smallest amount of money from new sales covers the direct costs &#0160;of coffee to do the writing.</p>
<p>Release Notes
</p>
<blockquote>April 9, 2013.<br /><br />This release updates the first 7 chapters of the book plus the introduction. Most of the changes are to fill in gaps, small reorganizations of the text, and line edits; there&#39;s not a ton of new original materials. Chapters 8 through to the end are unchanged.<br /><br />One of the things that&#39;s new in the Michigan FOIA world is that Muckrock (Appendix A) now supports FOIA requests to a number of Ann Arbor cities. My first trial with this worked a little bit well, and I&#39;m going to keep trying to improve how that system works so that I get the best writeup of it.<br /><br />A document trove from a recent FOIA request is a log of all FOIA requests to the City of Ann Arbor over the span of two months. Look for a future set of edits to expand the &quot;sample requests&quot; considerably based on that collection, since I&#39;m still digesting them.<br /><br />If anyone has tried the &quot;send to Kindle&quot; feature, let me know how it went.<br /><br />As always, if you have any questions, contact me at&#0160;<a href="mailto:edward.vielmetti@gmail.com" target="_blank">edward.vielmetti@gmail.com</a>&#0160;or&#0160;<a href="tel:%2B1%20734%20330%202465" target="_blank">+1 734 330 2465</a>.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Ed</blockquote></p>

      <p>A lovely day for a foolish parade. We were out and got some choice standing places in the springtime sunshine, and when the parade got to be too much for the youngest of the party, we went out for hot chocolate and a muffin.</p>
<p>This photo gives some idea of the fun. I didn&#39;t get a picture of my favorite puppet, which was a camera complete with &quot;flash&quot;. This was definitely a time to get photos with as much resolution as you can.</p>

      <p>There are lots of Fool Moon photos from 2013 online; I&#39;ll note them here as I find collections. But I thought I&#39;d add my own in to start of this cat/bunny/Peep.</p>

<p><a href="http://relish.myraklarman.com/foolmoon-2013" target="_self">Myra Klarman: FoolMoon 2013</a>. &quot;It was great to see so many veteran and first-time Fools participating in FoolMoon 2013. Their energy was amazing — enthusiastic, creative, welcoming, friendly, and, as always, totally Foolish! Also, the weather more than cooperated, which isn’t something we in Ann Arbor take for granted. &quot;</p>
