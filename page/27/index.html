Here&#39;s the current things that put birthday reminders in front of me every day. The 10,000 lb. gorilla of birthdays is Facebook, which offers a nice simple interface to send a one-line birthday greeting. You could visit Facebook daily just for birthdays and not much more, and be reasonably satisfied with the results. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-08-remembering-that-its-your-happy-birthday/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The&#0160;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is a secretive organization, but it does have a web site. Now Eric Mill (@konklone) is tracking that site&#39;s every change. His first writeup of it describes version one of a tracking system: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, responsible for overseeing the US government&#39;s foreign surveillance activities via FISA, actually does have a&#0160;public website. They seem to have just created it, as it doesn&#39;t have any documents from before June of 2013, and the Wayback Machine&#0160;has no record of it&#0160;prior to that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-07-watch-the-actions-of-the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court-with-fisacourt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777, crash landed at San Francisco Airport on Saturday, July, 2013 with 307 passengers and crew on board.

The plane did not report any problems before landing, and caught fire on the ground.

        <p>Several streets in Ann Arbor have flooded as a result of slow-moving storm cells that passed through the city on the afternoon of Thursday, June 27, 2013. Reports are still filtering in, but here&rsquo;s what I know about right now. The City of Ann Arbor is building a “Citizen Storm Corps” volunteer group to assist in stormwater/flooding data collection. Volunteers will visit Large Event Data Gathering locations after significant rain events, record visual observations about the stormwater&rsquo;s behavior at that location using a LEDG Stormwater/Flooding Reporting Form, and submit the data to the city. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-27-june-27-2013-flooding-in-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>
