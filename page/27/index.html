<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>&nbsp;An <a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/blogofneworleans/archives/2013/08/02/suspect-device-cartoonist-greg-peters-dies" target="_self">obituary for Greg Peters</a> is in Gambit, a New Orleans publication that he contributed political cartoons to. I knew him from high school in Marquette (from debate and High School Bowl) and hadn't stayed in touch for years, so this was a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-600wi" alt="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" /></a><br />Bottom, from left: Tom Baldini (coach), me (alternate), Greg Peters, Joel White, Kerry Johnson, Mike Coyne, David Goldsmith (host). "Nothing you learn is ever wasted."</p>
<p>The obit as published in NOLA.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cartoonist and writer Greg Peters died Friday morning, Aug. 2, after emergency surgery at Ochsner Medical Center. Mr. Peters, who had suffered from a congenital heart condition throughout his life, was 50 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Marquette, Mich., Peters arrived in Louisiana in 1990 to pursue a doctorate in English literature at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He became best known as the creator of “Suspect Device,” a starkly crafted, blackly funny Louisiana-themed political comic strip that made its debut in 1996, in the Times of Acadiana, and ran in New Orleans’&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/">Gambit Weekly</a>&nbsp;from 1999 to 2010. “Suspect Device” famously pulled no punches: In 1998, editor Harris Meyer resigned from the Times of Acadiana, when the paper’s publisher refused to run one of Mr. Peters’ strips.</p>
<p>“Suspect Device” was recognized with awards from the Press Club of New Orleans and the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, and in 2004 was anthologized in “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r18Or31mODcC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=greg+peters+attitude+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ih78UY3HG8iWqQHx7YFw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greg%20peters%20attitude%202&amp;f=false">Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists</a>.” Mr. Peters’ work was displayed in exhibitions in conjunction with the book at New York City’s Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art.</p>
<p>Greg Peters was “one of the few alternative weekly political cartoonists whose mission is to skewer local and state politicians," anthology editor Ted Rall told Gambit’s Scott Jordan in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/unusual-suspect/Content?oid=1243221">a 2004 profile of Mr. Peters</a>. "One would think that there would be such a cartoonist, or several, in every major city, but there just aren't,” he said.</p>
<p>“Coupled with an over-the-top clip-art style and incredibly distinct cartooning personality, Greg's strip is everything that his readers and editors can hope for."</p>
<p>Mr. Peters’ distinctive style involved the use of stock clip art images, arranged and annotated with wry, extensive text to skewer public figures.</p>
<p>"The clip art thing was always a punk staple," Mr. Peters told Jordan. "Like the cut-out letters and clip art that Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols designer, did using Queen Elizabeth with the safety clip through her cheek picture. They're very much out of the DIY ethos. And the attitude simply of baseline mistrust for authority, and the demand that you be shown, not told."</p>
<p>Greg Peters is survived by his parents, Reg and Kay Peters of Lafayette; his partner, Eileen Loh; his former wife, Saundra Scarce; and his two sons, Wilder, 12, and Magnus, 10. Plans for a memorial service in the New Orleans area are pending.&nbsp;</p>

Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SaveThePlainDealer" target="_self">Save the Plain Dealer</a>. A quote from it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;strategy&quot; that Advance Publications is forcing on The Plain Dealer and its other newspapers is poorly conceived, disastrously executed, and is focused solely on profits, not responsible journalism and sound business practice. History will judge it harshly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Facebook page says about 50 reporters were let go, or about a third of the news room.</p>
<p>Remember, the Advance team also owns the New Orleans Times-Picayune and AnnArbor.com, so this kind of newsroom downsizing is part and parcel of standard practice there.</p>

(I also had a beach nearby and a room full of relatives). Here&#39;s some observations from the mobile-only internet.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it&#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass. My online composition is sufficiently slow that I can&#39;t come anywhere near close to keeping up with my thoughts. So long writing is right out. </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t blog during the trip, and I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a bad thing. There were a handful of occasions where I used Twitter, and I took a few photos that are sharable. Again, because it&#39;s so hard to type, it was easy to let the moment go past.</p>
<p>Twitter was too addictive, as a kind of intermittent reinforcement made it possible to repeatedly swipe down the screen, hear a little click, and then hope that the new tweets were interesting enough to make it worthwhile. I followed a few new busy accounts and was treated to inning by inning baseball scores and some random bits of new weather. I&#39;ll have to unfollow most of them now - that is one nice thing about Twitter compared to Facebook in that you can get a temporary enthusiasm and then shed it quickly.</p>
<p>Email was hard - I could keep up with a little bit of it, but it was daunting to try to answer messages that were long. I knew I was going to be back soon so I let it pile up. I&#39;ll have to try a longer experiment with email to see if I could either shift the context of the emails off to voice or direct message or text message so that there wasn&#39;t such a need to follow throug with endless paragraphs.</p>
<p>I could get used to the mobile-only Internet. It was possible to ignore a lot of what landed in my inbox over the span of a vacation, and the few longer or more important messages will be easy enough to answer.</p>

<p>Shred the cabbage using the slicing blade of your food processor. Put the cabbage in a large bowl. Shake some salt on top of the cabbage and mix it in.</p>
<p>Trim the carrots and grate them using the grating blade of your food processor. Add to the cabbage.</p>
<p>The dressing is a mixture of cider vinegar and mayo. Rather than mix them together first and then getting a dish dirty, I simply pour some cider vinegar over the top of the cabbage-carrot mixture, then add some mayo. Mix thoroughly until the cole slaw is lightly coated with the dressing.</p>
<p>Let sit at least an hour before serving. The cabbage and carrots will both lose a little moisture, so you&#39;ll end up with more dressing than you started with.</p>
<p>Paired with pizza and two-buck chuck wine, this recipe will serve twelve.</p>

      <p>It's all over the local news, but it's a national story as well: Detroit has filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/detroit-files-for-bankruptcy.html?hp&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Detroit Files for Bankruptcy</a>, July 18. "Detroit, the cradle of America’s automobile industry and once the nation’s fourth-most-populous city, has filed for bankruptcy, an official said Thursday afternoon, the largest American city ever to take such a course."</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323993804578614144173709204.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTTopStories" target="_self">Detroit Files for Chapter 9 Bankruptcy</a>, July 18. "The Chapter 9 case filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan came after Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager, failed to reach agreements with enough of the bondholders, pension funds and other creditors to restructure Detroit's debt outside of court. The final decision rested with Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who had appointed Mr. Orr as Detroit's overseer in March."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/" target="_self">United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan</a> does not yet have this filing in its "High Profile" cases.</p>

A filing would produce an automatic stay of all pending litigation and would cap a month of intense talks between Orr’s team and creditors, which largely have failed to restructure as much as $20 billion in debt and long-term liabilities."</p>

<blockquote>
I try to keep my posts upbeat and full of bubbles and sparkles, but sometimes, even monsters have rough days.

I had an extremely disappointing first day at the Ann Arbor Art Fair. Almost immediately, State Street Art Fair representatives told me I was not allowed to perform. The police officers that came were extremely nice, and seemed to be siding with me, but they ultimately had to proceed under advisement from their sergeant.

The best way I can put it is that the Art Fair has effectively bought my beloved city of Ann Arbor during these four days, and has complete authority to do as they wish on its public streets and sidewalks. The State Street organization seemed to be concerned with money - since I hadn't paid them for space, they didn't want me there.

Ann Arbor does not require a permit for street performing. I believe that if I am practicing a reasonable code of conduct (which I always do), I have the right to be performing in a public space.

I talked to a few people from the Main Street Association about performing tomorrow, and it seems promising. Thank you all for your continued support, and for sharing this adventure with me. The comments I saw on twitter today were extremely encouraging. It'll take a whole lot more than a rough day to break my spirit. 

Awwwwwwwwwwwoooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!

<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 28, 2013 — On Thursday, June 27, 2013, the Ann Arbor area was deluged with intense rainfall that caused flooding conditions and significantly increased the flow of wastewater to the City of Ann Arbor Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) over a short period of time.&#0160; Plant flows more than tripled within a half hour.&#0160; As a result of this unprecedented increase in plant flow, approximately 10,000 gallons of untreated wastewater was discharged to the Huron River from&#0160;5:20 to 5:30 p.m.&#0160; By comparison, the WWTP fully treated approximately 350,000 gallons of wastewater during the 10-minute period over which this incident occurred.</p>
<p>Fortunately, due to a number of factors, the impact of this incident on human health and the environment is minimal.&#0160; The flow within the Huron River for the 10 minutes over which the discharge occurred was approximately 11,000,000 gallons, consequently the estimated 10,000 gallons of untreated wastewater was diluted by a factor of 1,000.&#0160; Further, mesh filters were already in place over the storm sewer inlets as part of the ongoing major construction project at the plant, which prevented solid material from entering the Huron River.&#0160; There are no communities downstream of the plant that withdraw water from the Huron River for drinking purposes.&#0160; In addition, the fact that the discharges occurred during extreme rain conditions makes it very unlikely that direct human contact would have occurred, particularly with the significant and immediate dilution of the discharge by the relatively high river flow.</p>
<p>&#0160;In accordance with regulatory protocols, the City of Ann Arbor WWTP contacted the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Washtenaw County Health Department to inform them of this unfortunate incident.&#0160; Plant staff is commended for demonstrating clear thinking and fast action under extreme conditions, which prevented this situation from being much worse.&#0160; Additionally, actions to avoid similar circumstances are being evaluated by plant staff.</p>

      <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;<em>perceived</em>&#0160;as two different cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. It would not be hard (except on Football Saturdays) to unsee the University, and it would not be hard to live a life on campus that never saw the city, especially if you are an undergraduate.</p>

      <p><p>I&#39;m <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/14479" target="_self">listening to the Sanford, Florida scanner</a> (via Broadcastify) after the&#0160;George Zimmerman verdict, and watching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Florida_vs._George_Zimmerman" target="_self">Florida v. Zimmerman</a>&#0160;wikipedia page. As of 10:20 p.m. ET, I&#39;m one of 6210 people listening, and there have been a dozen edits in the 20 minutes since the trial concluded. UPDATE: at 11:00 p.m. ET, the count of scanner listeners is 7355, down from a high of over 7600. Other busy scanners on Broadcastify include Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>11:45 p.m. Switched over to the <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/763" target="_self">Chicago scanner</a>&#0160;(via Broadcastify), which has 1274 listeners.</p>
<p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/george-zimmerman-verdict-trayvon-martin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Zimmerman Not Guilty</a>. &quot;But because of Florida’s laws, prosecutors had to persuade jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. A shortage of evidence in the case made that a high hurdle, legal experts said.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami Herald: <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/07/13/3499109/george-zimmerman-not-guilty-in.html" target="_self">Not Guilty</a>. “From a legal perspective, the jury believed that George Zimmerman was justified in using deadly force, that he was in danger of great bodily harm or death in the altercation with Trayvon Martin,’’ said David Edelstein, a Miami criminal defense attorney. “They believed he was simply responding with the force necessary to protect himself. They may also have concluded this was a tragic accident.’’</p>
<p>NBC News: <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/13/19441838-jury-finds-george-zimmerman-not-guilty" target="_self">Jury finds George Zimmerman not guilty</a>. &quot;Well aware of the passions surrounding the case, soon after the jury began deliberations Friday, the Seminole County sheriff appealed for calm whatever the outcome might be. &quot;We will not tolerate anyone who uses this verdict as an excuse to violate the law,” Sheriff Donald Eslinger said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/07/10/george_zimmerman_trial_trayvon_martin_s_shooter_is_probably_going_to_walk.html" target="_self">Slate</a> notes weaknesses in the prosecution, in an article published before the verdict. &#0160;&quot;To convict Zimmerman, the prosecutors have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. That hasn’t happened. And if the prosecution can’t prove its case, then Zimmerman&#0160;<em>should</em>&#0160;walk. Many will see this as an unsatisfying outcome; many will think it shouldn’t be this easy to kill someone, concoct an uncontradictable excuse, and get away with it. But a legally satisfying verdict cannot always be the same as a morally satisfying verdict. It would be unjust if Zimmerman were convicted based not on the strength of the evidence against him, but rather on the public sentiment against him.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html" target="_self">Full text of Anton Chekov&#39;s &quot;Gooseberries&quot; is available at Eldritch Press.</a>&#0160;An excerpt from this short story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted. Nicholai Ivanich laughed with joy and for a minute or two he looked in silence at the gooseberries with tears in his eyes. He could not speak for excitement, then put one into his mouth, glanced at me in triumph, like a child at last being given its favourite toy, and said:</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;How good they are!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;He went on eating greedily, and saying all the while:</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;How good they are! Do try one!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;It was hard and sour, but, as Poushkin said, the illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths. I saw a happy man, one whose dearest dream had come true, who had attained his goal in life, who had got what he wanted, and was pleased with his destiny and with himself....&quot;</p>

      <p>Karl Pohrt died Wednesday, July 10, 2013, after a battle with anaplastic thyroid cancer. He wrote about books and life on his weblog &quot;<a href="http://www.thereisnogap.com/" target="_self">there is no gap</a>&quot;. Karl was the owner of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Shaman_Drum" target="_self">Shaman Drum Bookshop</a>, an independent bookstore on Ann Arbor&#39;s State Street which closed in 2009 after a 29 year run.</p>
<p>Some obituaries from the net:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/58200-obituary-karl-pohrt.html" target="_self">Publisher&#39;s Weekly:&#0160;</a>&#0160;&quot;Karl Pohrt was a true bookman: a bookseller, compulsive reader, and a publisher as well. He had a very strong sense of the material and spiritual value of the reading experience. He was a man with a mission and an unshakeable devotion to the idea that books could transform human beings and the world for the better,&quot; said Bruce Joshua Miller of Miller Trade Marketing in Chicago.&#0160;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=7572" target="_self">Open Letter</a>: &quot;I’ll never forget all of the visits to Shaman Drum in Ann Arbor, which was one of the greatest independent bookstores ever. And Karl was one of the greatest managers ever. He assembled an amazing crew of employees, and did more for literature in Ann Arbor than the massive (also now defunct) competitor down the road . . .&quot; Chad Post</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2037#m20729" target="_self">Shelf Awareness:&#0160;</a>Mary Bisbee-Beek, who knew Karl when she lived in Ann Arbor, remembered: &quot;Karl told great stories and loved really off-beat movies. He loved to travel and he adored his two daughters, Tanya and Tasha. Family meant the world to him and community...if you were in Karl&#39;s world he was unstintingly loyal. If he loved a book, he&#39;d make sure everyone knew about it. I loved to talk to him about books and always felt on top of the world when I presented him with something that he connected with--it was like a good luck charm for the book and the author!&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A memorial service will be held for Pohrt on Sunday, July 14, at 2 p.m. at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation, 3257 Lohr Road, Ann Arbor.

      <p>The <a href="http://detroitwiki.org/Detroit_Sound_Conservancy" target="_self">Detroit Sound Conservancy</a> has a Kickstarter project going to raise $5,000 towards preserving the history of Detroit music through a series of oral history interviews of Detroit area music critics and journalists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no public oral history archive dedicated to Detroit music. We are going to build one. You can help. We are going to start with the &quot;first responders&quot; to the Detroit sound: Detroit music journalists. Detroit music journalists have been key archivists of Detroit sounds that have changed the world, from Motown to techno, blues to jazz, to so much more. They have documented the bands. They have interviewed the musicians. They tell the stories so the music lives. This project is for them. This is the Detroit Sound Conservancy&#39;s first project. You can be a part of making this happen.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130710/p10#a130710p10" target="_self">Google Latitude, a location sharing service, is shutting down</a>. There&#39;s not much of a surprise to this; the system was never very popular, with only (by various accounts) <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/354996088366837762" target="_self">5</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/355003689087401984" target="_self">9</a> or some other very small number of people using it. (I kid, but not by much). The best application for it appeared to be very close groups like families who wanted to keep track of where various family members were at the moment. It never got much of a public workout.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used social location sharing services <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/11/plazes_a_100_da.html" target="_self">since Plazes first came out</a> in 2005 or so, and each of them has their obvious utility and the corresponding creepy factor. I think part of the problem is that people don&#39;t know really how to use the extra sense of knowing where their friends are at the moment. There&#39;s a fine line between awareness of where someone else is and the sense that you&#39;re stalking them, and most systems generate at least one creep-out situation before too long and then you decide to back away from them.</p>
<p>The newest location sharing service I&#39;m using is <a href="http://www.waze.com" target="_self">Waze</a>, which bills itself as a social GPS. It is useful if you&#39;re driving, not if you&#39;re walking, and it&#39;s primarily valuable for having better real-time traffic feedback than most GPS systems including the ability to reroute based on actual current conditions. The social aspect is extremely minimal so far (a few beep-beeps at one friend) but the availability of near real time traffic conditions and commentary from in the car is fascinating enough. It does seem to drain the battery of my Nexus 4 more than most apps.</p>
