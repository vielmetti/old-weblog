Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid.

PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION SEEKS PUBLIC INPUT ON POTENTIAL DOG PARK LOCATIONS
ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 29, 2013 — The City’s Dog Park Subcommittee of the Park Advisory Commission (PAC) is inviting the public to participate in an online survey to gather feedback and opinions on potential dog park locations and features. The survey,&#0160;www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG, is brief and should take about 10 minutes to fill out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-07-wondering-if-other-cities-have-dog-park-subcommittees-that-issue-press-releases/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most complete collection of links about the Bezos transaction.
Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-05-jeff-bezos-buys-the-washington-post/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>TOR is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &quot;onion routers&quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &quot;dark&quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-05-tor-network-anonymity-compromised-by-javascript-exploit/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>&quot;Make the pile smaller&quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-04-make-the-pile-smaller/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The question from a story in the Marquette Mining Journal:
 MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act.
The association is important to plaintiffs in the case because it was created under state law requirements by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which makes it a public body by extension, the plaintiffs contend. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-03-is-the-northern-michigan-geologic-repository-association-a-public-body-under-michigan-foia/">&raquo;</a></p>

First and foremost, it&#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass.

        <p>With 25 days to go, the FOIA Machine kickstarter is almost 2x overfunded. They are looking to build a system for automatically tracking and managing FOIA requests.
I am not clear how this effort differs from the already existing MuckRock News system, but there&#39;s room for innovation in the space because FOIA can be the world&#39;s worst search engine and any help is welcomed.
