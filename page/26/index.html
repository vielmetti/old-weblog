<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>Credit to Salon&#39;s Andrew Leonard for the article &quot;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/17/revenge_ego_and_the_corruption_of_wikipedia/" target="_self">Revenge, ego, and the corruption of Wikipedia</a>&quot;, which unmasks wiki-troll Qworty and his pattern of anonymous mean-spirited edits to settle old grudges. Qworty - his real name is not important to my discussion of him - was a prolific Wikipedian. He routinely sabotaged the biographies of rival writers by doing things like removing lists of literary prizes they had won after they had died. Because Qworty generally played within the rules of the Wikipedia game, even his most egregious efforts had their defenders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/opinion/sunday/wikipedias-sexism-toward-female-novelists.html?_r=0" target="_self">the Filipacchi episode</a>, Qworty did not lack for defenders. Qworty, like many other Wikipedia editors, took seriously his responsibility to root out what he considered self promotion,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Peacock">unjustifiable praise</a>&#0160;or outright&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Puffery">puffery.</a>&#0160;Just the facts, ma’am! He described himself,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Qworty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=552532243">on his own Wikipedia user page,</a>&#0160;as particularly focused on identifying and fixing “articles with potential conflicts of interest.” Wherever he found people manipulating Wikipedia to their own advantage, he would intervene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Leonard caught wind of Qworty&#39;s excesses and decided to investigate further. What he found led to a remarkable revelation: Qworty was playing a game with Wikipedia, a game different from that of neutral points of view and building the knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Qworty&#39;s user page has been blanked, but thanks to Wikipedia&#39;s infinite memory, it lives on in past revisions. Before the page was shut down, it was replaced by a &#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qworty&amp;oldid=556021296" target="_self">postmodernist manifesto</a> of sorts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you ask “Who is Qworty?” be aware of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_fallacy" title="Affective fallacy">affective fallacy</a>&#0160;and the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy" title="Intentional fallacy">intentional fallacy</a>. Be aware that not everybody has reacted to my words in the way that you do (because not everybody is like you), and be aware that anybody who is trying to guess my intentions as a writer is blowing the purest gas.</p>
<p>So who is Qworty? Qworty is one of the creators of text on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And what is Wikipedia? Wikipedia is the great postmodern novel, the book that&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>&#0160;might have written if he had lived long enough and could somehow convert himself into the finite number of monkeys who are writing this postmodern novel that is subtitled “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia is pretty busy telling you what it is not—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>—so the question must be engaged, just what&#0160;<em>is</em>&#0160;Wikipedia, besides a poorly understood post-modern novel in perpetual progress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The postmodern encyclopedia does not like being described as such, and Qworty (after some thrashing about) has been banned from Wikipedia.</p>

      <p>The site loads slowly, the photos are all squished together, and the carefully curated metadata and tags and comments and photo names are de-emphasized. It&#39;s like a weird mix of Pinterest and Tumblr.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping for a <a href="http://classic.flickr.com" target="_self">classic.flickr.com</a> to preserve the old UI, in the same way that old-school Weather Underground users can use <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com" target="_self">classic.wunderground.com</a> to see things the way they were meant to be.</p>
<p>If I had the time, I&#39;d cherry pick the best photos from my Flickr stream and blog about them here.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Yahoo is in talks to acquire Tumblr, with a price tag north of a billion dollars. Who knew that simplifying the blogging interface could be so profitable? I wonder, though, how Yahoo is going to make money off of Tumblr page views without ruining the service. (cf Flickr) (cf <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/10/google-analytics-real-time-vs-mybloglog.html" target="_self">MyBlogLog</a>) (cf GeoCities) etc. &#0160;<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/yahoo" target="_self">See what Tumblr users think of the acquisition</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You know that house your friends got that was the best hang out, watch tv, party you face off, great pot lucks, still clean and comfy to chill in place? Then the landlords were like ugh, yall gotta go, and then the best hang out place was gone?</div>
<p>Yeah, so where is everyone heading now that Yahoo bought this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing like a big messy purple smooch from Yahoo to make users fear for their accumulated friendships on a service that just wants to monetize page views with ads.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-15-internet-2020/">Internet 2020</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Some predictions for what the internet will look like in 2020, covering trends in mobile, laptop, social media like Facebook and Twitter, low-cost computer hardware, high speed networks and corporate evolution. Prepared for the LA2M marketing lunch meeting, 14 May 2013.</p>
<p>1. Mobile. See how far we&#39;ve come in a few short years (Wikipedia):</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d-pi"><img alt="Mobile_phone_evolution" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mobile_phone_evolution" /></a><br />We have a steady stream of innovations for better phones in the same size. Then what happens? The glass rectangle takes over, the keyboard disappears, and the screens start to get bigger. Behold the <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/3426134/will-you-buy-phablet-this-year/" target="_self">phablet</a>:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d-pi"><img alt="Pcadvisor-phablet-Jim_on_large_phone" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Pcadvisor-phablet-Jim_on_large_phone" /></a></p>
<p>What next? A few predictions. Mobile devices get more and more important as Internet devices; the sensible person who is developing a new web site should think first about how it looks on mobile. Devices themselves keep mutating - smaller, bigger, fancier, cheaper - and the rapid purchase cycle on mobile phones ensure that enough people have the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>This is my biggest prediction about the internet of 2020 - for more and more people, the mobile device will be their primary device, and all of the systems that depend on a big screen and a full keyboard will face pressure from the small screen.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Laptops</p>
<p>Back in 1981 - and really, that wasn&#39;t that long ago - the closest thing to laptops looked like this, the luggable 23.5 pound Osborne 1. (Image: Wikipedia)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d-pi"><img alt="Osborne_1_open" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Osborne_1_open" /></a></p>
<p>Thirty-some years later, we&#39;re twenty pounds lighter, with a better keyboard, better screen, six orders of magnitude more memory, and built in high speed communications. (Image: Apple)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b-pi"><img alt="Macbook-air-overview_gallery_everyday" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Macbook-air-overview_gallery_everyday" /></a></p>
<p>What&#39;s left to improve? The only thing left to remove from the weight of the device is to remove the keyboard entirely. Alas, that suggests to me that laptops start to enter a stage of stagnation, where you can&#39;t rely on rapid technological turnover to drive sales, and people keep their devices for three, four, five, six years since they have something that&#39;s perfectly good. That leaves the consumer with free cash to spend on mobile devices (see #1) and time to spend on smaller devices.</p>
<p><br />3. Facebook</p>
<p>Remember the ubiquitous America Online CDs? (Photo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dainbinder/" target="_self">Dain Binder</a>)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b-pi"><img alt="Aol-cds-flickr-dain-binder" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Aol-cds-flickr-dain-binder" /></a><br />I really don&#39;t see how Facebook wins in the long run, to the extent that it&#39;s just like America Online. At some point something new comes along and the kids go there and the old service is just for old people. Old people are inconvenient - they aren&#39;t as much fun to advertise to, they tend to do inconvenient things like get sick and die, and do you really want your Facebook feed to look like an obituary feed?</p>

No. I think it will be less important and heading the way that all closed systems are heading, where the people who are there like it but few new people are joining and key demographics head for greener pastures. They are going to try to move the full-sized, rich, immersive Facebook environment (designed for laptop-sized screens), but the experience of Facebook Home (two star rating in the Google store, and ATT pulling the Facebook Home phone from sale) is that they will have trouble adapting to a mostly-mobile world.</p>

<p>The next step in short messaging services was SMS, which moved the power of the telegraphic communication from the telegraph network to the mobile phone network.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b-pi"><img alt="Mashable-autocorrect-19_32_00_157_file" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mashable-autocorrect-19_32_00_157_file" /></a><br />In that context, how do you view Twitter? Unlike Facebook, which ties individual accounts to individual people and attempts to shape the entirety of the user experience in posting and receiving, Twitter is a relatively more flexible system which allows not just people to post but also has a place for robots and automated machinery to post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make the bold assertion that short status updates are a better place to build a future world of Internet computing than all-encompassing immersive friend-driven environments.</p>
<p>5. Tiny computers and the internet of everything</p>
<p>Here&#39;s why I think the short message is the foundation of future computing.</p>
<p>Once upon a time if you wanted to do home automation - let&#39;s say, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/03/magazine/fast-forward-really-remote-control.html" target="_self">hooking up a temperature probe to your hot tub</a>, so that you coudl be sure that it didn&#39;t freeze in the Michigan winter if your tub heater conked out - you&#39;d set up something like this (a Sun 3/60, photo Wikipedia). It was about $5000 worth of gear used, and if you were the first person to do this (like Paul Haas of Ypsilanti) Esquire Magazine would get word of it and note &#39;Paul&#39;s kind of geeky&#39;.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c-pi"><img alt="Sun3_60_Disk_Tape" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sun3_60_Disk_Tape" /></a><br />Now days, small programmable internet devices are cheap. There&#39;s the bare bones CPU of the Raspberry Pi, easily comparable in power to the $5000 Sun, for $35 (Photo: CNET)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b-pi"><img alt="Cnet-Raspberry_Pi_35332544_05_1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Cnet-Raspberry_Pi_35332544_05_1" /></a><br />and shiny consumer devices like the Nest thermostat take the power of small controllers to the next step of plug-in readiness:</p>

<p>7. Death of the net</p>
<p>&#0160;Finally, it&#39;s worth remembering what has disappeared from the network (and why) to have some sober expectations for the much-beloved services of today that are going to strike out.</p>
<p>Image: <a href="http://www.googleappsforedu.com/google-reader-alternative/" target="_self">GoogleAppsForEdu</a></p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c-pi"><img alt="Googleappsforedu-google-reader" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Googleappsforedu-google-reader" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>One reason that services close is that the organization that runs them no longer has the appetite for them. Google has killed a number of services that it has acquired after pulling from them the good ideas and the people resources that attracted them to it in the first place.</p>
<p>Sometimes services die because there&#39;s better ones available - see the Internet Gopher, which peaked in 1993, 20 years ago, when it was bigger than the World Wide Web. (Image: Brad W. James)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d-pi"><img alt="Bwjames-gopher" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bwjames-gopher" /></a><br />The death of Gopher is either the result of technological determinism (Web pages were prettier) or the result of poor management (U of Minnesota was looking for licensing fees). In either case, what did happen was that a system that many people used disappeared from public view in a few short years</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d-pi"><img alt="Screen shot 2013-05-13 at 3.30.58 PM" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen shot 2013-05-13 at 3.30.58 PM" /></a><br />The Internet turns out to be a cyclical industry, with periods of manic growth interspersed with deep depressions. The dot-com flameout, as expressed in Phil Kaplan&#39;s &quot;F&#39;d Companies&quot;, chronicled the demise of dozens of well-funded but poorly thought out new companies of the dot-com era.</p>
<p>If we look forward far enough in time, it&#39;s almost certain that the Internet will go through some sort of corrective cycle, with startup companies dying faster than they are born. They will run out of money, or some part of the ecosystem that sustains them will fall apart just long enough to wipe them out, or their founders will get hired away by some megacorp and their project/product abandoned in the process.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager.html" target="_self">I wrote an early review of Contactually</a>, and I signed up for their pro service after the trial period expired. I used the system for a couple of months, but have decided to back down from the pro version back to the free version for a while. Here are some reasons for that.</p>

<p>First and perhaps foremost, Contactually is relatively expensive at $20/mo. I looked at what I was spending (or not spending) on other internet services that I use and like. I don&#39;t have a Flickr Pro account, but I used to, and I could get a year of service for less than two months of Contactually. Similarly I could renew another year of Pinboard pro service for less than two months of Contactually. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s expensive in absolute terms, but relative to other things I want to spend money on online, it looks spendy.</p>

<p>Second - and this is as much of a criticism of my habits than of Contactually - I never really managed to get it to systematically unearth new people to contact that had fallen off my radar. Rather than provide an ever-changing set of new folks to prod me to reconnect with, it seemed to recommend the same people over and over. That was useful at first to be mindful of people a second time if I had passed them by the first time, but the net result was that there were fewer people than I expected that Contactually re-introduced me to.</p>

<p>I have an Android phone, and Contactually doesn&#39;t yet have an Android app. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a deal breaker, but I&#39;m hoping that they come out with something that&#39;s awesome - and I&#39;m willing to re-up for pro service again in order to try it out if that&#39;s what it takes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still unhappy overall with the state of Android contact managers. I would have thought that everyone ever designing a contact manager would have an updatable field for &quot;last contact date&quot; that had some kind of easy to view screens to see how you&#39;re doing, and that would be smart about noticing phone calls, emails, text messages, and meetings from your calendar. Hey, you could do that even on paper rolodex cards! Contact management basics need to be better across the board so that your phone can prompt you on who to call next, a sort of predictive dialer for your life.</p>

Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age?</p>
<p>One approach is the &quot;virtual bookplate&quot;, described in <a href="http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/419.full" target="_self">this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida</a>. The catalog is extended to include graphics that honor the donor of the materials, and the search is extended to make it easy to look up all of the works that were donated by a particular individual. The story goes that a donor was so impressed at how easy it was to see a pretty view of what they had given to the library that they wrote a check on the spot to donate more.</p>
<p>Another perspective on this is the &quot;virtual collection of bookplates&quot;. The one of these that I&#39;ve found is the&#0160;<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/exlibris/" target="_self">John Starr Stewart Ex Libris Collection</a>&#0160;at the University of Illinois, with over 1500 plates collected between 1903 and 1906.

If suppressed content automatically goes viral, the Internet&#39;s construction basically guarantees that that content will have a home for the rest of time.

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time there was a Journal of Irreproducable Results, which published science humor. It started in 1955, says Wikipedia, and saw a schism in 1995 that led to the founding of the Annals of Improbable Research. AIR is noted for its awarding of the prestigous Ig Nobel awards, rewarding achievements that&#0160;&quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;.</p>
<p>Now the august journal Nature is getting into the fray, with an entire special issue on <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/index.html" target="_self">Challenges in Irreproducable Research</a>. They describe it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>No research paper can ever be considered to be the final word, and the replication and corroboration of research results is key to the scientific process. In studying complex entities, especially animals and human beings, the complexity of the system and of the techniques can all too easily lead to results that seem robust in the lab, and valid to editors and referees of journals, but which do not stand the test of further studies. Nature has published a series of articles about the worrying extent to which research results have been found wanting in this respect.
</blockquote>
<p>For more sources of irreproducable conclusions, a very good source is
the <a href="http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/">Retraction Watch weblog</a> which tracks scientific fraud through watching for retractions of published papers. Now not every irreproducable result is the result of fraud - sloppy mistakes and bad data handling are in part to blame, as are difficult to replicate experimental conditions. Retraction Watch also covers garden-variety scientific fraud like plagiarism and the sin of submitting a single paper to more than one journal.</p>

We did one other thing. We arranged all the attributes in alphabetical order, and then 
used a random number generator to select (without replacement) either 10 or 15 attributes 
from among them and then replicated this experiment a number of times. Here are the 
 results for one particular replication of the experiment for truly hypothetical wines.

<p><em>Château La Merde, 1995. Packed and tight, with oily, smoked game and petrol, yet 
with reﬁned fruit, a hint of black fruit and olive ﬂavors and aromas, and supported 
by meaty fruit, undergrowth and lush tannins running through the lengthy ﬁnish. 
Best from 2007 through 2025, Inky, with olive-tinged black currants, blackberries,

      </h3>
      <p>From Systemantics, the systems bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Systems-people share certain attributes in common, each specific system tends to attract people with specific sets of attributes. For example, people who are attracted to auto racing are likely to be people who enjoy driving fast, tinkering with high-powered cars, and beating other people in fierce competition. The System calls forth those attributes in its members and rewards the extreme degrees of them. But a word of warning is in order.&nbsp;<em>A priori</em>&nbsp;guesses as to what traits are fostered by a given system are likely to be wrong. Furthermore, those traits are not necessarily conducive to successful operation of the System itself, e.g., the qualities necessary for being elected president do not include the ability to run the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Systems attract not only Systems-people who have attributes for success&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;the system. They also attract individuals who possess specialized attributes adapted to allow them to thrive at the expense of the system, i.e., persons who&nbsp;<em>parasitize</em>&nbsp;them. As the barnacle attaches to the whale, these persons attach themselves to systems, getting a free ride and a free lunch as long as the system survives.</p>

      <p>Press release from the City of Ann Arbor</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>E. Stadium Bridges Dedication Ceremony is Tuesday, May 14, 10 a.m.</p>

<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 11, 2013 — A brief dedication ceremony for the City of Ann Arbor’s E. Stadium Bridges Replacement Project will be held at 10 a.m., Tuesday, May 14, 2013 near 1501 S. State Street, next to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street. Congressman John Dingell will be joined with representatives from the national Department of Transportation, as well as officials from MDOT, Washtenaw County, City of Ann Arbor, project contractors, neighbors, and the general public. Temporary public parking will be available on the UM Red Lot adjacent to the bridge over S. State Street.</p>

<p>Within 12 months, the E. Stadium Bridges Reconstruction Project built two new bridges, on-street bike lanes, a new sidewalk on the south side--and a widened sidewalk along the north side--of E. Stadium Boulevard, a new sidewalk along the west side of S. State Street with a signalized pedestrian crossing of the railroad tracks, two staircases connecting E. Stadium Boulevard to S. State Street, ADA-compliant facilities with an accessible path between S. State Street and E. Stadium Boulevard, storm water quality<br />
improvements, new water mains, improvements to Rose-White Park, landscaping, and many other features.</p>

<p>The City of Ann Arbor received funding from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for $13.9 million in TIGER II Discretionary Grant Funding, and about $1.67 million and $1.20 million, respectively, in Local Bridge Program and Transportation Enhancement Funding. All told, the City received about $16.8 million (or about 73 percent of the total estimated project costs) in state and federal funds to complete the project. The remaining 27 percent of the project was funded via various city sources including the Ann Arbor voter-approved Street and Bridge Resurfacing & Reconstruction Millage as the required local-match for the grants. Public notifications of developments in the E. Stadium Bridges project have been posted at www.annarborbridges.org.</p>

<p>The previous E. Stadium Bridges were built in 1928. The bridges carry more than 24,000 vehicles per day.</p>

It&#39;s OK to say which county you located the morels in, but don&#39;t narrow it down any more than that. I happen to know that morels can be found in Marquette County, but even my mom won&#39;t always provide an exact location.</p>
<p>With this mapping in mind, here&#39;s a few sources for early morel sightings in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michigan-Morels/261288532041" target="_self">Michigan Morels</a> has daily reports with photos of people showing off the results of their hunt. No maps, but lots of county reports.</p>
<p>MorelHunters.com (&quot;Where the hunters gather&quot;) has a <a href="http://morelhunters.com/" target="_self">morel progression map</a> on their front page. The Michigan bit of it is included below, as of 1 May 2013.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I do a lot of writing in vim these days, in part because my fingers already know how to make words move around on the page. I find it easier to do the work in a place where I can rely on muscle memory for routine changes rather than have to laboriously guide the mouse around to do edits.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was an outlining tool called MaxThink (it still exists, for Windows only) that applied the same kind of keyboard-heavy work to outline editing. MaxThink is unique as far as I know in that in addition to the typical kind of outline commands it also had powerful operations like &quot;bin sort&quot; that operated on the outline as a whole. If you had learned the system (and it was non-trivial to learn) you could re-sort a collection of headings faster than you could pick up any one of them with a mouse.</p>
<p>If you can get to the point where your fingers know how to get the desired results onto the page, writing and editing can be very quick. I&#39;ll admit to only learning a working subset of vim - there are lots of commands that I never use - but the ones that I do have in my brain really don&#39;t require thinking to take on.</p>

A diligent editor created a category of &quot;American women novelists&quot; and began adding female novelists to it, and then removing them from the category &quot;American novelists&quot;. A predictable hue and cry ensued. James Gleick tells the story in some detail in the NY Review of Books, under the title &quot;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/29/wikipedia-women-problem/" target="_self">Wikipedia&#39;s Women Problem</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Categorization is hard in a Wikipedia world. The namespace for articles is flat, so there&#39;s no implicit categories assigned simply by what a page is named. On the other hand, categories can contain subcategories, and the Wikipedia editors take advantage of this to create elaborate categorical structures. Everything is part of something else, in some extended rhetorical tangle. (The image is from the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization" target="_self">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>.)</p>
<p>Categories don&#39;t have to have subcategories, of course; that&#39;s a convention that&#39;s not universal to all wiki software. Localwiki&#39;s equivalent structure looks more like tags, and tags are in one big flat namespace with no explicit hierarchy.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the choice is how to best improve findability of articles, and how to incorporate a distinctive feel to a system. Wikipedia has &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Doughnuts" target="_self">Category:Doughnuts</a>&quot;, with one subcategory &quot;Doughnut shops&quot; which in turn has a subcategory &quot;Tim Hortons&quot; which in turn has 12 pages, including Timbits. Arborwiki has a page <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Donuts" target="_self">Donuts</a>, which includes pages tagged with the tag &quot;donuts&quot;, and is in turn tagged as &quot;Pastries that are not strange&quot;. (And yes, there is a &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/tags/pastriesthatarestrange" target="_self">Pastries that are strange</a>&quot; tag as well.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a problem when the technically correct task of splitting a big category into smaller parts runs smack into the political minefield of deciding which part of the category is to be primary and which is to be secondary. No one wants to be secondary, and no reasonable system would always yield category warring. Perhaps Wikipedia has bumped up against some size limit where it&#39;s impossible for any one person to understand the complexity of the classification system it has built.</p>

<p>
A number of Windstream Corp. customers in the greater Charlotte area are experiencing service outages affected by what the company is calling “a widespread outage affecting long-distance and toll-free call processing.”
The outage occurred around 11:30 a.m., said company spokesman David Avery.
Though the Arkansas-based company hasn’t stated how far the outage extends, posts on Twitter and Facebook suggest the outage is multi-state.
