        <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop. The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-09-city-council-report-august-8-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

The AnnArbor.com story about the meeting and a Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-08-notes-from-the-ann-arbor-city-planning-commission-of-august-7-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most complete collection of links about the Bezos transaction. Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-05-jeff-bezos-buys-the-washington-post/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>TOR is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &quot;onion routers&quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &quot;dark&quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-05-tor-network-anonymity-compromised-by-javascript-exploit/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>&quot;Make the pile smaller&quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-04-make-the-pile-smaller/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The question from a story in the Marquette Mining Journal: MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act. The association is important to plaintiffs in the case because it was created under state law requirements by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which makes it a public body by extension, the plaintiffs contend. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-03-is-the-northern-michigan-geologic-repository-association-a-public-body-under-michigan-foia/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia - These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;perceived&#0160;as two different cities. The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-15-when-i-hear-a2council-talking-about-the-city-and-the-university-i-think-about-china-mievilles-the-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>
