<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>From my Ann Arbor neighborhood email list, September 2013:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some weaselly-looking character from an outfit called "Just Energy" knocked on our door today. They are of course scam artists and we just tell them we are not interested. They are very pushy and actually try to mislead people into thinking they have something to do with the utility companies. The especially like to prey on the elderly. </p>

  <p>When dealing with a person who shows up at your door unannounced or without prior notification (be it a cable provider, maintenance worker, plumber, salesperson) exercise healthy levels of caution and care before agreeing to anything. If a person shows up at your door without proper notification, promptly ask to see an ID, business card or supervisor’s phone number before conducting any further business. If an individual is unable to provide any of the aforementioned forms of identification, discontinue the interaction. </p>

  <p>To assess and monitor the needed changes, the ICC ordered Just Energy to pay for an independent audit completed last year. The previously confidential document said that between 2010 and 2011 Just energy received over 29,792 complaints. “It’s really an astonishing figure, the 29,000 complaints. We have never seen anything like that,” said David Kolata, the head of the Citizens Utility Board.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-24-notes-on-meetup/">Notes on Meetup</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b" alt="Logo" title="Logo" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I've started using <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> to organize several groups. Here's some notes.</p>

<p>For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 meetup</a> which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</p>

<p>A brand new Meetup is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech</a> Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup, which had its first meeting the other night. This is a more classic meetup, one that tries to meet monthly rather than weekly, one that's similar to other groups around the country, and one where I'm starting out from the perspective that I mostly don't know everyone who's going to be interested.</p>

<p>Meetup is a form of civic technology (for the purpose of organizing meetings). For a2civictech, I've been able to use the function of annotating the photos from the meeting to remember who was there, and the little discussion forum around the event is just enough to prepare for meetings and remember what happened there. Meetup also allows you to track the input and output of money to the group, so it's reasonable to track expenses and reimbursement for even little bits of money.</p>

<p>The meetup system isn't free; a semi-annual fee of $72 applies. So by not being free it gives me the opportunity to have other folks help share in the cost of running things. a2civictech is sponsored in part by <a href="http://a2geeks.org">a2geeks</a> and that's been a great plus in getting it going. You can also share in the roles of actually organizing things by giving co-conspirators some additional rights to manage things.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most is that Meetup is actually designed pretty well to help you successfully organize a meeting. I'm so used to group-forming tools like Yahoo Groups and Google Groups where the goal is to have a discussion online and where the in-person efforts are a very late afterthought. The system comes with a checklist of all of the useful things you can do, and the automated emails for the event planner gently prompt you to do the right thing at the right time. There's obviously a lot of thought and evolution in this system which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>The verdict so far: worthwhile to continue for 6 months, and probably worth renewing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.</p>

<p>Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.bostonorganics.com/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw/re/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw">Boston Organics</a> follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.</p>

<p>The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. If something particularly interesting comes as a result of this expedition through public records, a second request should be straightforward since you know that relevant records exist because someone else already got them.</p>

<p>One of the possible problems in asking for FOIA logs is if the public body in question has multiple parts of it that answer FOIA requests, and your seemingly simple request has to get allocated to multiple places. I think this is the reason that both the City of Ypsilanti and Wayne State University asked for more than $60 in fees to retrieve a month's worth of logs - I think, but am not certain, that the fees reflected the need to go both to the administrative side of routine FOIAs as well as to police department FOIAs for the same period.</p>

<p>The bright spot in all of this has been the City of Ann Arbor, which responds promptly and without fees for requests for city FOIA logs. Every single request is numbered, so that you can be certain that you're getting the whole set, and I specifically didn't ask for police logs in that case.</p>

<p>My naive assumption going into this was that every agency would be able to produce a stack of letters that they had received for FOIA requests with minimum cost and minimum search time. That proved not to be the case. I'll need to dig deeper the next time I send such a query in to make sure I'm not inadvertently asked for too much.</p>

<p>I don't want to guess how much water (and money) was leaking down the drain, but I think I have this problem fixed for now. The next step is to replace or repair the toilet, but until then, at least it won't be a source for high water bills.</p>

<p>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">City of Ann Arbor</a> for having <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/ann-arbor-water.html">detailed daily water billing</a> information online. It would only be better if they published average daily usage numbers so that you could benchmark yourself against other citizens, or if you could set alerts or alarms on your usage so that if it went over a certain amount you could get notified to see what was wrong.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From a transcript of an 18 September 2013 interview on <a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now</a> about the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/18/the_1_000_year_flood_did">aftermath of the 2013 Colorado floods</a>. Jim Pullen is a reporter at Colorado radio station <a href="http://www.kgnu.org/">KGNU</a>, an independent community station in Boulder and Denver. Hyperlinks are my own.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NERMEEN SHAIKH: And when do you expect to learn, Jim Pullen, of the extent of the environmental contamination as a result of these floods?</p>

<p>JIM PULLEN: That, I think that is going to take some weeks, very unfortunately. There are two things going on — well there are several things that are going on that are of incredible concern. Of course, in any flood event, there are going to be a lot of contaminants in the water. There are going to be dead animals, there are going to be — there are oil stations — gasoline stations that have been inundated. People’s homes have been inundated, and people keep a lot of chemicals in their homes that are under relatively low protection.</p>

<p>We have some very serious issues here in the state of Colorado in addition to those normal flooding issues. We have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">Rocky Flats plant</a>, or what was once upon a time the Rocky Flats Plant where plutonium is underground. And there has been extensive flooding in that area. And we also have tens of thousands of active oil and gas wells in the state, 20,000 alone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weld_County,_Colorado">Weld County</a>. The industry — a lobbying group is reporting 1900 of those oil and gas wells have been shut down, and including the two largest suppliers, <a href="http://www.nobleenergyinc.com/">Noble Energy</a> and <a href="http://www.anadarko.com/">Anadarko</a> are reporting about five to ten percent of their wells have been shut down.</p>

<p>For example, Noble Energy owns 7600 wells in Weld County itself, which is right to the northeast of us. So, there are a lot of contaminants potentially floating around. And in the case of Rocky Flats, I spoke with a Christine Everson (ed. note: <a href="http://www.kristeniversen.com/">Kristen Iversen</a>?) last night and she said it is going to take weeks for laboratory results of plutonium and other contaminants to become available to the public.</p>

<p>Notes: A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24107038/state-and-industry-struggle-assess-damage-flooded-oil">Denver Post story</a> of September 16 further reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colorado's richest oil field — the Denver-Julesburg Basin — is buried in floodwaters, raising operational and environmental concerns, as state and industry officials work to get a handle on the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Thousands of wells and operating sites have been affected — some remain in rushing waters, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>"The scale is unprecedented," said Mike King, executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. "We will have to deal with environmental contamination from whatever source."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MILLIKEN — Industry crews have placed absorbent booms in the South Platte River south of Milliken where at least 5,250 gallons of crude oil has spilled into the flood-swollen river.</p>
  
  <p>The spill from a damaged tank was reported to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Wednesday afternoon by Anadarko Petroleum, as is required by state law.</p>
  
  <p>State officials have responded to the spill site, which is south of Milliken near where the St. Vrain River flows into the South Platte.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-18-an-active-if-diffuse-media-ecosystem/">An active if diffuse media ecosystem</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Anna Clark, writing in the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/advance_changes_gears_ann_arbor_mlive.php?page=all&amp;print=true">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.</p>

<p>The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. Further, I want to make very clear the difference between urgent breaking news and the sort of slog it out, cover it every day beat journalism that is mostly interesting in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Twitter has always been good for breaking news, whether it be local, national, or global. I'm perfectly convinced that in the case of the 100-year flood, we'll be covered. There's enough individual people who are capable of writing about what's happening to them in enough local detail that if an issue is city or county wide, Ann Arbor will be notified. Newspapers always do their best work in response to crisis, and local bloggers, radio, and metro Detroit television will all chip in. If something horrible or wonderful happens, we're all good as far as news goes.</p>

<p>That can't be said for every town, by the way. When Marshall, Michigan had an Enbridge pipeline burst in its midst, there was no local news media to write about or blog about the weird hydrocarbon smell. Ann Arbor has enough of a "diffuse media ecosystem" that such things should be noticed! However, you can't even count on that - a long-seeping sewer spill in the Arboretum was unnoticed for weeks - you'd hope that we'd catch something faster here.</p>

<p>It's the problem of news that's not urgent that I'm more worried about. Small retail businesses come and go, and you can't count on the Ann Arbor News to write about all of those retail changes. Crime, petty and otherwise, gets reported when the police department wants it to be reported, and thus you'll see a lot more Ypsilanti crime in the Ann Arbor paper than Ann Arbor crime just because of the willingness of YPD to share. The <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> does a fine job of bird-dogging city council, but its ferociously detailed coverage only extends so far. The <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> only comes out monthly, but it routinely scoops the daily media.</p>

<p>Short of finding someone with more money than sense to start a new publication, what can  you do? The CJR story says that people turn to "small independent news sites to fill in the gaps." As the Ann Arbor News shrinks, the opportunity to fill in the gaps should only grow. A narrowly focused topic that's interesting and that the dwindling mainstream media only gives cursory attention to would be perfect, and if you can give the world quick and accurate writing as well as compelling photography you'll be all set.</p>

<p>Small independent news sites are usually a labor of love, in some fashion. Notably they come and go as people's priorities change or as they age out of the "independent grad student blogger" demographic. It's almost the case that you need to recruit a new crop of writers every fall, purging your blogroll of the recently departed and scouring the net for the newest up-and-coming.So the local media infrastructure is active - there's no shortage of writing about Ann Arbor, both in local and in national publications. It's also incredibly diffuse, without a single dominant comprehensive news source that covers everything in detail. My best solution to date has to be tuned in to Twitter to catch what I can as it goes past, and write down what I see that's not getting enough notice so that I can contribute my small share.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a>. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).</p>

<p>First, you'll need a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a> account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. The way it works is that the receivers are hooked up to a digital front end that lets you tune them remotely and that plays back the audio through the net. In general only one person can tune in at a time, so it's first come first served. </p>

<p>Second, you'll need to have some idea of which AM and FM stations your favorite team's radio network covers. For example, the <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/schedule/radioaffiliates.jsp">Detroit Tigers radio network</a> has AM and FM station ranging from Houghton in the U.P. to Toledo Ohio and Angola Indiana, and the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp">Houston Astros radio network</a> also covers San Antonio and Shreveport. If the Tigers play the Astros, you can possibly tune to either network's stations - you'll either get home or away team coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, and here's the tricky part, you'll want to figure out which of the tuners covers which of the stations you are interested in. As it happens none of the tuners cover any stations that the Tigers routinely broadcast on, but the Astros are on KTKR 760 AM <a href="http://www.ticket760.com/main.html">Ticket 760</a> in San Antonio, and there's a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/info.php?r=1155">receiver in San Antonio</a> that might be free to listen through to them.</p>

<p>Figuring out radio channels can be weird - some stations have higher power and transmit over clear channels for long distances, and others don't cover much more ground than the city they are based in. So the "best" channel to tune in might be for a station that's powerful but far away. When you search through the MLB.com site for stations, look for the "flagship" station listed, which often broadcasts with higher power and over a greater distance than the other stations in the network. As an example, here's a report of <a href="http://globaltuners.blogspot.com/2011/10/knbr.html">hearing the San Francisco Giants</a> from a tuner in Phoenix, AZ more than 600 miles away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signal was weak at a distance of over 650 miles, with little interference from other stations but some noise and fading.  Nonetheless, the content was usable and the station IDs clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hobby of DXing gets an extra boost when you can tune in to radios that are far away. It's fun to scan the dial and hear what's out there. Most tuners have a band scan listing that you can see what's there. I listen to remote radio stations on <a href="http://www.tunein.com">Tunein</a> as well, but there's not the same sense of being there when the reception is too perfect, and the baseball powers that be block internet-based games over regular radio channels.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new? Were all of the URLs that I had collected for stories on <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> going to suddenly go 404 on me? Was it going to be impossible for me to provide news clippings proving that I had produced a story every day for months on end? All a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Things are bad, but not as bad as they would seem.</p>

<p>All of the old content on AnnArbor.com is still there, but all of the navigation that would help you find it is gone. If you view the <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> home page through your web browser it will redirect to MLive. Fortunately, any deeper links within the site still work, so you can see e.g. my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/foia-friday-index/">FOIA Friday index</a> and all of the links there still work. There's even a search engine (using Google search) on that page.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aannarbor.com+vielmetti&amp;oq=site%3Aannarbor.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i58j69i61j69i59.1939j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#psj=1&amp;q=site:annarbor.com+vielmetti">search Google</a> for "site:AnnArbor.com vielmetti" you'll get back a page of links, but half of them won't work - any tag, category, or section in the old site redirects to MLive. This means that if you were a blogger and were carefully tagging your stuff so that it could be found again, all of that effort is gone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s "Wayback Machine" to the rescue, at least in part. That site faithfully and patiently scraped content from AnnArbor.com and stored it away forever, and it preserved enough of the links and surrounding content that it is possible to navigate up to a point. The Internet Archive's collection even includes the current temperature for the day that the page was saved! It's not perfect - some links will still break - but it's much better than nothing.</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of the MLive site - it's slow, disorienting, and hard to search through and navigate. But it's what we now have, and I don't hold out any promise for radical reinvention of that system. Rather, I expect that Ann Arbor newspaper readers will get an increasingly thin product, watered down with repurposed statewide news and ever more devoid of local identity. Fortunately there's the <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> bird-dogging civic meetings and the <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> observing changes in the area, so not all is lost.</p>

<p>Some more local views on the topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/09/the-ann-arbor-news-is-back.html">Damn Arbor</a> notes that the Ann Arbor News is back, and his lead paragraph is worthwhile repeating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turritopsis nutricula, the immortal jellyfish, is unique among animals in that it can revert back to its clonal polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. In a similar process, The Com announced today that it would be reverting back to its previous state as the Ann Arbor News and reintegrating the MLive Media Group as part of MLive.com. It should be be noted The Com exists as a subsidiary of MLive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know you might be tempted to be pissed off anew over today’s announcement, but I think it bears repeating that, at least in the short term, we need for M-Live and the new twice-weekly Ann Arbor News to be successful. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the national point of view:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/advance_publications_scraps_an.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a> says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advance is now about to fold AnnArbor.com (the website) into MLive.com, the company’s Michigan portal based on its hideous website template. This is what’s on the homepage of MLive as I type. Prepare to shield your eyes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The city of Boulder, Colorado is flooded after several days of torrential rains. Here's some useful links if you want to get up to speed on what's going on.</p>

<p>Turn around, don't drown. If you're in the affected area, get authoritative news from local sources (and not this blog).</p>

<h3>Scanner</h3>

<p>For raw unfiltered news of what is happening, listen to the emergency services scanner for the Boulder area. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/591">Boulder County Sheriff and Fire</a> feed has over 800 listeners as of this writing. You'll want to listen through headphones, because the feed is a stereo feed with fire/rescue on one channel and police on the other.</p>

<p>A good text counterpart to this is the <a href="http://twitter.com/boulderoem">Boulder Office of Emergency Management twitter</a> feed, which has brief and authoritative updates about the situation. The <a href="http://boulderoem.org">Boulder OEM web site</a> echoes those updates in more detail.</p>

<h3>Local news media</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/">Daily Camera</a> is Boulder's daily newspaper, and it has continuous updates on the situation. Their <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_24072038/boulder-county-broomfield-under-flash-flood-warning-major">September 12 story</a> is a long list of incidents, warnings, accounts and stories about what's going on. Twitter: @<a href="http://twitter.com/dailycamera">dailycamera</a></p>

<p>There's flooding in the Denver area as well, and the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com">Denver Post</a> is on it. A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24077193/boulder-county-flood-emergency-1-killed-streets-impassable">September 12 Denver Post story</a> notes the extent of the damage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy rain and massive flooding threatens towns and cities up and down the Front Range into the day Thursday as communities were evacuated, roads closed and emergency shelters set up.
  Three people were confirmed dead and at least one missing.
  At an afternoon news conference Boulder officials said at least 12 dams in the county had overflowed.The Boulder airport was closed as well as Boulder mountain parks and open space until further notice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>As ever, Twitter is on the scene when there's news. The #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boulderflood">boulderflood</a> and #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cowx">cowx</a> hashtags have been trending, with photos, video, and brief accounts of what's happening. A #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23coflood">coflood</a> tag covers flooding across Colorado.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>A map has been removed per the owner's request on 25 October 2013.</p>

<p>The City of Boulder has a <a href="http://gisweb.ci.boulder.co.us/agswebsites/general/iemcop/index.htm">road closures map</a> with markers showing where roads are closed or impassible. Officials are recommending that people stay off the roads.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, September 12 in the evening I have not been able to find a good clear map that shows the full extent of affected areas, and emergency operations are still in rescue mode.</p>

<p>Google has a <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-boulder-floods">crisis map for the 2013 Boulder Floods</a>. This is a snapshot as of Friday, September 13, in the morning. The dots mark places where roads are closed, and the evacuation area for Longmont is shown as the St Vrain River bisects the town. Look at the current map for the latest details, and know that roads are being opened and closed in response to changing needs.</p>

<h3>Water levels</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=bou&amp;gage=bocc2">Boulder Creek hydrograph</a> shows current water levels measured in Boulder. As of this writing the creek is in "moderate flood stage" and rising.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>This flood is being compared to the 1894 Boulder flood. The <a href="http://boulderhistory.org/boulders_great_flood.asp">Boulder History Museum</a> account of that flood reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As rains continued, adding to spring runoff, Boulder Creek began to rise. The threat of a flood was serious. Overnight, the creek rose out of its banks and rushed through the canyons above Boulder. By daybreak the creek had turned into an angry river, carrying debris from the settlements and bridges it destroyed in the mountains. In Boulder, the creek had begun its destruction as it swept the Sixth and Twelfth Street bridges downstream. The flood submerged railroad tracks, roads and farms, and tore down telephone and telegraph poles, taking Boulder’s means of transportation and communication out of commission.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet.  This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.</p>
  
  <p>The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters. </p>
  
  <p>“You want to know my tricks?  How I keep from losing my mind. /
  Basically, I just remember I’m not one of a kind. /
  I connect to as many artists as I can find that are genuine /

      </h3>
      <p>I don't know what other people's experiences are, but increasingly I'm finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone's wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.</p>

<p>The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks).</p>

<p>My phone has a bandwidth cap so I don't know if I can keep this up all month, and it's always better to use a fast free unlimited connection than a limited one that you bring yourself. I'm just wondering if this is a sign of a long-term trend where the wifi that you carry with yourself everywhere is faster, more reliable, and less error-prone than the "free" public infrastructure.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There's no better way to learn about your home town than by trying to start a wiki for it. In that regard, I'm happy to announce a new <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/">Localwiki installation for Marquette County, Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> crew has developed a new hosting platform for people who want to start a wiki for their area, but who don't have the resources or the time or the skills to launch their own server. It runs on <a href="http://localwiki.net">Localwiki.net</a>, and currently has about two dozen sites up and running. Your town or region could be next!</p>

<p>When I originally envisioned doing a wiki for Marquette, I was thinking ambitiously and thought "hey, I'll do the whole U.P." I'm glad I didn't, not at least yet. There's enough small amounts of nitty-gritty detail about local history, ghost towns, old mines, and bits of industrial archaeology that I have just enough knowledge to tackle for the Marquette area, but don't have any clue where I'd start for Houghton or Escanaba or the Soo. Someone else can tackle that.</p>

<p>Marquette County is the biggest county (by area) in Michigan, so there's plenty of geography to cover. It's also home to some political subdivisions like <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Humboldt_Township">Humboldt Township</a> that have less than 500 inhabitants, no post office of their own, and no chance ever that anyone there would start a wiki just for that place alone.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a>, which covers Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County, I see this as the very first step towards a project that could last a long time. At a few pages a day for a few years you could start to get to the point where you had enough material to be useful for a visitor, a local, or a historian, and where people who would never be notable enough for a first draft biography on Wikipedia might get properly noted or memorialized. I'm looking forward to learning more so that the next time I visit I'll be that much better informed.</p>

There's a reminder function to alert you when it's time to take your medicine, a log that tracks when you actually did take your meds, and a simple comment log that lets you add notes about how it's going or any side effects you noticed. If you're doing detailed logging of weight, blood pressure, or a number of other vital signs there's a place for that.</p>

<p>At the moment there's no web-based version of it, but the site hints at a "cloud" version, which I suppose I'd welcome.</p>

<p>The test of any software like this is twofold. First, does it help you actually follow your prescription better than a simple alarm or a pillbox. Second, does it help you when you are at the doctor's office talking about your health. I haven't tested either, but I'm looking forward to updating this review when I get a few months of actual use in place.</p>

      <p>Originally seen on <a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/">Deadline Detroit</a>, my go-to place for quick hits on Detroit news - the <a href="http://metrotimes.com/">Metro Times</a> is up for sale. If you ever wanted to be in journalism now's your chance.</p>

<p><a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/articles/6165/for_sale_the_metro_times">From the article</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company that owns the Metro Times told its Detroit staff this morning (August 26, 2013) the paper is for sale, throwing the future of the 33-year-old alternative weekly into doubt at a time of great uncertainty for print publications.</p>
  
  <p>Few details were available; employees were told not to speak to the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was noted (and I can't recall where, sorry) that there is no independent library that has a full run of the Metro Times archived, and there's a reasonable concern that if the Metro Times morgue is sold along with the paper that a big piece of Detroit music history could be lost.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A note from Steve Pierce regarding a request for ideas and code to help people log into a free WiFi mesh network. Contact him for details at bottom.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://hdl.com">HDL.com</a> and volunteers have deployed a free WiFi network in SE Michigan over the last 5 years. With over 1,000 access points deployed and 650,000 unique devices connected, <a href="http://wireless.ypsi.com">Wireless Ypsi</a> and companion networks such as <a href="http://detroitenabled.org/">Detroit Enabled</a> are averaging over 2,500 users per day, making it one of the largest free WiFi networks in the country.</p>

<p>The equipment and connections are paid for by local community groups like Focus Hope and Public Housing along with business owners and community champions. No money is charged to use the WiFi service, nor is there any advertising revenue. </p>

<p>The free network, called Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled is HDL.com’s way of giving back to the community. We help secure Internet bandwidth and donate time and equipment to support the free network.</p>

<p>The struggle we face is making sure we comply with Internet Service providers terms of service agreements. One recent requirement is to not have anonymous access to the network. While we would love to have open and free Internet for everyone, the reality is Internet service costs money and the major carriers like Comcast and AT&amp;T don’t provide the service for free. So while Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled offer free WiFi for residents, business and visitors, someone still needs to pay for the connections.</p>

<p>To continue to use these paid connections we need a system that will allow people to sign up for free accounts to use the service. We want something akin to Facebook or Twitter that will allow for instant sign up and use of the free WiFi network.</p>

<p>Users would provide their name, address, phone and email address and chose a secure password. They would immediately be granted access to the network for one day. A confirmation email link is sent to the email address and it must be confirmed to continue to use the service beyond the first day.</p>

<p>Authentication would use a RADIUS server or similar service which would need to be selected, as well. We must insure proper data security and programming techniques are used to protect the data.</p>

<p>Not having a login and registration system is the single largest barrier we face today to continued large scale deployments of free WiFi. We have proven with our 5 year success story that the network is reliable and sustainable. Yet not having a login and registration system has virtually stopped us from expanding services into new areas until we can address this need.</p>
