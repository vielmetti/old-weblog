<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Frank’s Restaurant is under new management – as of October 1, says the sign. They are advertising extended late night hours.</p>

<p>Frank's is well known as "the fortified high point of Ann Arbor", according to its menus.</p>

<p>I wrote about Frank's 6 years ago as part of a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/placeshout---ht.html">review of Placeshout</a>, which was a simple application for taking short (100 character) notes on locations. That was from the era of the Ann Arbor "nova mob", a cadre of people who could be counted on to use any new social or review site and instantly propel Ann Arbor to the top of the list for cities reviewed, second usually only to San Francisco. Placeshout is gone (without even a goodbye message), and the nova mob has scattered to the winds. But Frank's is still here, and good luck to its new management.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here's a 24 hour snapshot from the <a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity</a>. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Why the volatility? It turns out that a popular Bitcoin trading site, Silk Road, has been shut down by the Feds. Silk Road was known for its free and easy Bitcoin-fueled trading in drugs, and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002">indictment alleges</a> that the proprietor, a certain Ross William Ulbricht, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts," also used the site to plan a contract "hit" on someone who crossed his path.</p>

<p>Combine this with the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:ArborWiki">pages that link to this template</a> and you get a short list of forward links from Wikipedia to Arborwiki. There's a similar page of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Entries_with_pages_in_Wikipedia">Arborwiki entries with pages in Wikipedia</a> that completes the loop.</p>

<ul>

      </h3>
      <p>A power outage on a 138,000 volt line that provides power to Metro North trains in New York has snarled commutes from Connecticut to New York City and has also affected Amtrak service in the busy New York - Boston corridor. Work is underway to put in a temporary fix by diverting power from surrounding businesses and neighborhoods. A backup feeder line was offline, and full service restoration may take weeks.</p>

<p>Metro North is responding by putting diesel trains into service and by running buses to try to accommodate the 130,000 daily commuters on the line, but this provides only about a third of the capacity needed for a normal commute.</p>

<p>NY Times, "Power Failure Disrupts Metro North’s New Haven Line; May Last Days", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/metro-norths-new-haven-line-suspended-after-power-loss.html">September 25, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disruption began after a Consolidated Edison feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed around 5:20 a.m., snarling service between Stamford, Conn., and Grand Central Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CT Post, "Metro-North, Con Edison tested plan that led to failure", <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Metro-North-service-What-you-need-to-know-4845143.php">September 26, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it may take officials weeks to determine the cause, it appears the 138,000 volt line that was left to bear the burden of energizing trains along an eight-mile stretch of track in Westchester County, N.Y., from Pelham to Rye became overwhelmed and superheated.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Business Week, "Delayed NYC Commuters Ask Why Metro-North Power Failed Again", <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-09-27/stranded-nyc-commuters-ask-why-metro-north-power-failed-again#p1">September 27, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said yesterday that Con Edison representatives told him the company is working to get a portion of the electricity needed to the commuter line. The power would come from three transformers to be tested this weekend, Malloy said. He said updates will be provided to residents the night before the Sept. 30 commute. “There appears to have been little plan for this type of catastrophic failure,” Malloy said during the briefing at Grand Central.</p>

<p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck.</p>

<p>The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.</p>

<p>It's very different writing for someone else than it is for myself. Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor is not one of them. Rather, there's a terrifying time when you hit "publish" and the world either sees your headline and says "meh" or they pick it up and share it with their friends.</p>

<p>Ultimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I've written here before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unpolished-open-notebook.html">keeping an open notebook</a> and what that means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing. But when you're writing for someone else the whole package really wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a separate set of expectations.</p>

Here's some notes.</p>

<p>For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 meetup</a> which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</p>

<p>A brand new Meetup is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech</a> Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup, which had its first meeting the other night. This is a more classic meetup, one that tries to meet monthly rather than weekly, one that's similar to other groups around the country, and one where I'm starting out from the perspective that I mostly don't know everyone who's going to be interested.</p>

<p>Meetup is a form of civic technology (for the purpose of organizing meetings). For a2civictech, I've been able to use the function of annotating the photos from the meeting to remember who was there, and the little discussion forum around the event is just enough to prepare for meetings and remember what happened there. Meetup also allows you to track the input and output of money to the group, so it's reasonable to track expenses and reimbursement for even little bits of money.</p>

<p>The meetup system isn't free; a semi-annual fee of $72 applies. So by not being free it gives me the opportunity to have other folks help share in the cost of running things. a2civictech is sponsored in part by <a href="http://a2geeks.org">a2geeks</a> and that's been a great plus in getting it going. You can also share in the roles of actually organizing things by giving co-conspirators some additional rights to manage things.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most is that Meetup is actually designed pretty well to help you successfully organize a meeting. I'm so used to group-forming tools like Yahoo Groups and Google Groups where the goal is to have a discussion online and where the in-person efforts are a very late afterthought. The system comes with a checklist of all of the useful things you can do, and the automated emails for the event planner gently prompt you to do the right thing at the right time. There's obviously a lot of thought and evolution in this system which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>The verdict so far: worthwhile to continue for 6 months, and probably worth renewing.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.</p>

<p>The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. If something particularly interesting comes as a result of this expedition through public records, a second request should be straightforward since you know that relevant records exist because someone else already got them.</p>

<p>One of the possible problems in asking for FOIA logs is if the public body in question has multiple parts of it that answer FOIA requests, and your seemingly simple request has to get allocated to multiple places. I think this is the reason that both the City of Ypsilanti and Wayne State University asked for more than $60 in fees to retrieve a month's worth of logs - I think, but am not certain, that the fees reflected the need to go both to the administrative side of routine FOIAs as well as to police department FOIAs for the same period.</p>

<p>The bright spot in all of this has been the City of Ann Arbor, which responds promptly and without fees for requests for city FOIA logs. Every single request is numbered, so that you can be certain that you're getting the whole set, and I specifically didn't ask for police logs in that case.</p>

<p>My naive assumption going into this was that every agency would be able to produce a stack of letters that they had received for FOIA requests with minimum cost and minimum search time. That proved not to be the case. I'll need to dig deeper the next time I send such a query in to make sure I'm not inadvertently asked for too much.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From a transcript of an 18 September 2013 interview on <a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now</a> about the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/18/the_1_000_year_flood_did">aftermath of the 2013 Colorado floods</a>. Jim Pullen is a reporter at Colorado radio station <a href="http://www.kgnu.org/">KGNU</a>, an independent community station in Boulder and Denver. Hyperlinks are my own.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NERMEEN SHAIKH: And when do you expect to learn, Jim Pullen, of the extent of the environmental contamination as a result of these floods?</p>

<p>JIM PULLEN: That, I think that is going to take some weeks, very unfortunately. There are two things going on — well there are several things that are going on that are of incredible concern. Of course, in any flood event, there are going to be a lot of contaminants in the water. There are going to be dead animals, there are going to be — there are oil stations — gasoline stations that have been inundated. People’s homes have been inundated, and people keep a lot of chemicals in their homes that are under relatively low protection.</p>

<p>We have some very serious issues here in the state of Colorado in addition to those normal flooding issues. We have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">Rocky Flats plant</a>, or what was once upon a time the Rocky Flats Plant where plutonium is underground. And there has been extensive flooding in that area. And we also have tens of thousands of active oil and gas wells in the state, 20,000 alone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weld_County,_Colorado">Weld County</a>. The industry — a lobbying group is reporting 1900 of those oil and gas wells have been shut down, and including the two largest suppliers, <a href="http://www.nobleenergyinc.com/">Noble Energy</a> and <a href="http://www.anadarko.com/">Anadarko</a> are reporting about five to ten percent of their wells have been shut down.</p>

<p>For example, Noble Energy owns 7600 wells in Weld County itself, which is right to the northeast of us. So, there are a lot of contaminants potentially floating around. And in the case of Rocky Flats, I spoke with a Christine Everson (ed. note: <a href="http://www.kristeniversen.com/">Kristen Iversen</a>?) last night and she said it is going to take weeks for laboratory results of plutonium and other contaminants to become available to the public.</p>

  <p>Colorado's richest oil field — the Denver-Julesburg Basin — is buried in floodwaters, raising operational and environmental concerns, as state and industry officials work to get a handle on the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Thousands of wells and operating sites have been affected — some remain in rushing waters, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>"The scale is unprecedented," said Mike King, executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. "We will have to deal with environmental contamination from whatever source."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MILLIKEN — Industry crews have placed absorbent booms in the South Platte River south of Milliken where at least 5,250 gallons of crude oil has spilled into the flood-swollen river.</p>
  
  <p>The spill from a damaged tank was reported to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Wednesday afternoon by Anadarko Petroleum, as is required by state law.</p>
  
  <p>State officials have responded to the spill site, which is south of Milliken near where the St. Vrain River flows into the South Platte.</p>

      <p>Anna Clark, writing in the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/advance_changes_gears_ann_arbor_mlive.php?page=all&amp;print=true">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.</p>

<p>The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. Further, I want to make very clear the difference between urgent breaking news and the sort of slog it out, cover it every day beat journalism that is mostly interesting in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Twitter has always been good for breaking news, whether it be local, national, or global. I'm perfectly convinced that in the case of the 100-year flood, we'll be covered. There's enough individual people who are capable of writing about what's happening to them in enough local detail that if an issue is city or county wide, Ann Arbor will be notified. Newspapers always do their best work in response to crisis, and local bloggers, radio, and metro Detroit television will all chip in. If something horrible or wonderful happens, we're all good as far as news goes.</p>

<p>That can't be said for every town, by the way. When Marshall, Michigan had an Enbridge pipeline burst in its midst, there was no local news media to write about or blog about the weird hydrocarbon smell. Ann Arbor has enough of a "diffuse media ecosystem" that such things should be noticed! However, you can't even count on that - a long-seeping sewer spill in the Arboretum was unnoticed for weeks - you'd hope that we'd catch something faster here.</p>

<p>It's the problem of news that's not urgent that I'm more worried about. Small retail businesses come and go, and you can't count on the Ann Arbor News to write about all of those retail changes. Crime, petty and otherwise, gets reported when the police department wants it to be reported, and thus you'll see a lot more Ypsilanti crime in the Ann Arbor paper than Ann Arbor crime just because of the willingness of YPD to share. The <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> does a fine job of bird-dogging city council, but its ferociously detailed coverage only extends so far. The <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> only comes out monthly, but it routinely scoops the daily media.</p>

<p>Short of finding someone with more money than sense to start a new publication, what can  you do? The CJR story says that people turn to "small independent news sites to fill in the gaps." As the Ann Arbor News shrinks, the opportunity to fill in the gaps should only grow. A narrowly focused topic that's interesting and that the dwindling mainstream media only gives cursory attention to would be perfect, and if you can give the world quick and accurate writing as well as compelling photography you'll be all set.</p>

<p>Small independent news sites are usually a labor of love, in some fashion. Notably they come and go as people's priorities change or as they age out of the "independent grad student blogger" demographic. It's almost the case that you need to recruit a new crop of writers every fall, purging your blogroll of the recently departed and scouring the net for the newest up-and-coming.So the local media infrastructure is active - there's no shortage of writing about Ann Arbor, both in local and in national publications. It's also incredibly diffuse, without a single dominant comprehensive news source that covers everything in detail. My best solution to date has to be tuned in to Twitter to catch what I can as it goes past, and write down what I see that's not getting enough notice so that I can contribute my small share.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-listening-to-baseball-online-with-global-tuners-radio/">Listening to baseball online with Global Tuners radio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a>. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).</p>

<p>First, you'll need a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a> account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. The way it works is that the receivers are hooked up to a digital front end that lets you tune them remotely and that plays back the audio through the net. In general only one person can tune in at a time, so it's first come first served. </p>

<p>Second, you'll need to have some idea of which AM and FM stations your favorite team's radio network covers. For example, the <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/schedule/radioaffiliates.jsp">Detroit Tigers radio network</a> has AM and FM station ranging from Houghton in the U.P. to Toledo Ohio and Angola Indiana, and the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp">Houston Astros radio network</a> also covers San Antonio and Shreveport. If the Tigers play the Astros, you can possibly tune to either network's stations - you'll either get home or away team coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, and here's the tricky part, you'll want to figure out which of the tuners covers which of the stations you are interested in. As it happens none of the tuners cover any stations that the Tigers routinely broadcast on, but the Astros are on KTKR 760 AM <a href="http://www.ticket760.com/main.html">Ticket 760</a> in San Antonio, and there's a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/info.php?r=1155">receiver in San Antonio</a> that might be free to listen through to them.</p>

<p>Figuring out radio channels can be weird - some stations have higher power and transmit over clear channels for long distances, and others don't cover much more ground than the city they are based in. So the "best" channel to tune in might be for a station that's powerful but far away. When you search through the MLB.com site for stations, look for the "flagship" station listed, which often broadcasts with higher power and over a greater distance than the other stations in the network. As an example, here's a report of <a href="http://globaltuners.blogspot.com/2011/10/knbr.html">hearing the San Francisco Giants</a> from a tuner in Phoenix, AZ more than 600 miles away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signal was weak at a distance of over 650 miles, with little interference from other stations but some noise and fading.  Nonetheless, the content was usable and the station IDs clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hobby of DXing gets an extra boost when you can tune in to radios that are far away. It's fun to scan the dial and hear what's out there. Most tuners have a band scan listing that you can see what's there. I listen to remote radio stations on <a href="http://www.tunein.com">Tunein</a> as well, but there's not the same sense of being there when the reception is too perfect, and the baseball powers that be block internet-based games over regular radio channels.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new? Were all of the URLs that I had collected for stories on <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> going to suddenly go 404 on me? Was it going to be impossible for me to provide news clippings proving that I had produced a story every day for months on end? All a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Things are bad, but not as bad as they would seem.</p>

<p>All of the old content on AnnArbor.com is still there, but all of the navigation that would help you find it is gone. If you view the <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> home page through your web browser it will redirect to MLive. Fortunately, any deeper links within the site still work, so you can see e.g. my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/foia-friday-index/">FOIA Friday index</a> and all of the links there still work. There's even a search engine (using Google search) on that page.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aannarbor.com+vielmetti&amp;oq=site%3Aannarbor.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i58j69i61j69i59.1939j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#psj=1&amp;q=site:annarbor.com+vielmetti">search Google</a> for "site:AnnArbor.com vielmetti" you'll get back a page of links, but half of them won't work - any tag, category, or section in the old site redirects to MLive. This means that if you were a blogger and were carefully tagging your stuff so that it could be found again, all of that effort is gone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s "Wayback Machine" to the rescue, at least in part. That site faithfully and patiently scraped content from AnnArbor.com and stored it away forever, and it preserved enough of the links and surrounding content that it is possible to navigate up to a point. The Internet Archive's collection even includes the current temperature for the day that the page was saved! It's not perfect - some links will still break - but it's much better than nothing.</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of the MLive site - it's slow, disorienting, and hard to search through and navigate. But it's what we now have, and I don't hold out any promise for radical reinvention of that system. Rather, I expect that Ann Arbor newspaper readers will get an increasingly thin product, watered down with repurposed statewide news and ever more devoid of local identity. Fortunately there's the <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> bird-dogging civic meetings and the <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> observing changes in the area, so not all is lost.</p>

<p>Some more local views on the topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/09/the-ann-arbor-news-is-back.html">Damn Arbor</a> notes that the Ann Arbor News is back, and his lead paragraph is worthwhile repeating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turritopsis nutricula, the immortal jellyfish, is unique among animals in that it can revert back to its clonal polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. In a similar process, The Com announced today that it would be reverting back to its previous state as the Ann Arbor News and reintegrating the MLive Media Group as part of MLive.com. It should be be noted The Com exists as a subsidiary of MLive.</p>

<p>And the national point of view:</p>

<p>Turn around, don't drown. If you're in the affected area, get authoritative news from local sources (and not this blog).</p>

<h3>Scanner</h3>

<p>For raw unfiltered news of what is happening, listen to the emergency services scanner for the Boulder area. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/591">Boulder County Sheriff and Fire</a> feed has over 800 listeners as of this writing. You'll want to listen through headphones, because the feed is a stereo feed with fire/rescue on one channel and police on the other.</p>

<p>A good text counterpart to this is the <a href="http://twitter.com/boulderoem">Boulder Office of Emergency Management twitter</a> feed, which has brief and authoritative updates about the situation. The <a href="http://boulderoem.org">Boulder OEM web site</a> echoes those updates in more detail.</p>

<h3>Local news media</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/">Daily Camera</a> is Boulder's daily newspaper, and it has continuous updates on the situation.

<p>The City of Boulder has a <a href="http://gisweb.ci.boulder.co.us/agswebsites/general/iemcop/index.htm">road closures map</a> with markers showing where roads are closed or impassible. Officials are recommending that people stay off the roads.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, September 12 in the evening I have not been able to find a good clear map that shows the full extent of affected areas, and emergency operations are still in rescue mode.</p>

<p>Google has a <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-boulder-floods">crisis map for the 2013 Boulder Floods</a>. This is a snapshot as of Friday, September 13, in the morning. The dots mark places where roads are closed, and the evacuation area for Longmont is shown as the St Vrain River bisects the town. Look at the current map for the latest details, and know that roads are being opened and closed in response to changing needs.</p>

<h3>Water levels</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=bou&amp;gage=bocc2">Boulder Creek hydrograph</a> shows current water levels measured in Boulder. As of this writing the creek is in "moderate flood stage" and rising.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>This flood is being compared to the 1894 Boulder flood. The <a href="http://boulderhistory.org/boulders_great_flood.asp">Boulder History Museum</a> account of that flood reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As rains continued, adding to spring runoff, Boulder Creek began to rise. The threat of a flood was serious. Overnight, the creek rose out of its banks and rushed through the canyons above Boulder. By daybreak the creek had turned into an angry river, carrying debris from the settlements and bridges it destroyed in the mountains. In Boulder, the creek had begun its destruction as it swept the Sixth and Twelfth Street bridges downstream. The flood submerged railroad tracks, roads and farms, and tore down telephone and telegraph poles, taking Boulder’s means of transportation and communication out of commission.</p>

<p>Lunch at Madras Masala (Maynard St) for a2b3 this week, Thursday from about 11:45 a.m. to about 1:00 p.m.</p>

<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s); js.id=id;js.async=true;js.src="https://secure.meetup.com/3245529744623182445/script/api/mu.btns.js?id=igjj6e5ek67086svhlh1bblo1o";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","mu-bootjs");</script>

<p>The usual routine is to show up, fill up a plate with yummy food from the buffet, and sit down for discussion. At 12:30pm someone will note the time and then I'll make a round of introductions and ask a question to prompt conversation. </p>

<p>We've had as many as 8 people for lunch and as few as 4 at Madras Masala, but the restaurant is flexible and if we were to get a huge crowd there's space.</p>

      <p>My friend Papillon is working on a double album "Calligraphy" which he's producing with the help of an Indiegogo campaign. Of this he says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet.  This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.</p>
  
  <p>The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters. </p>
  
  <p>“You want to know my tricks?  How I keep from losing my mind. /
  Basically, I just remember I’m not one of a kind. /
  I connect to as many artists as I can find that are genuine /
  And that know our mission’s divine.”
  (Lyrics from “My Truth”)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I don't know what other people's experiences are, but increasingly I'm finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone's wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.</p>

<p>The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks).</p>

<p>My phone has a bandwidth cap so I don't know if I can keep this up all month, and it's always better to use a fast free unlimited connection than a limited one that you bring yourself. I'm just wondering if this is a sign of a long-term trend where the wifi that you carry with yourself everywhere is faster, more reliable, and less error-prone than the "free" public infrastructure.</p>
