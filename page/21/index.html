<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>The <a href="http://twitter.com/twentypoundcarp">Twenty Pound Carp</a> is mounting a quixotic write-in campaign for Ann Arbor City Council in Ward 4, as evidenced by this campaign sign.

<p>2012 was a disaster for Michigan apple growers, but 2013 has been a good year. From <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131024/ARTICLE/131029937">Capital Press</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.</p>
  
  <p>Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.</p>
  
  <p>“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the limiting factors in the apple harvest is the availability of seasonal workers to pick the crop. Last year was a bad year and some migrants resettled to other states. From <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/michigan_apple_crop_migrant_wo.html">MLive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market demand also will play a role in determining how many apples are left in the fields or sent to packers and processors, said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee that represents some 850 family-owned orchards.</p>
  
  <p>Smith estimates the apple harvest workforce is short about 20 percent. Labor has been the industry's top concern for many years, since it's tough to find an adequate skilled workforce, she said, adding that immigration policies that allow migrant workers to go back and forth between the U.S. and their home countries would help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://record-eagle.com/latest-mobile/x1909741911/Migrant-worker-shortage-hits-orchards-in-Traverse-City-area/print">Traverse City Record-Eagle</a> notes the impact in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some affected growers, particularly in the Grand Rapids area, are prioritizing and picking only varieties that have the best financial return, said Jim Bardenhagen, an area fruit and vegetable farmer and retired 20-year Leelanau County extension director.</p>
  
  <p>Bardenhagen said several area farmers told him that only about half of migrant workers needed to pick apples in the region came to northwestern lower Michigan this year and that many are new to the work. He personally lost only one worker in his crew of three. Area crews generally can vary from about five to 30.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a good year to look for orchards that are doing a gleaner's harvest to donate to local food banks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I deeply appreciate city council's dedication to a balanced budget and basic services, we cannot simply save our way to success. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Pfizer">Post-Pfizer</a>, Ann Arbor must increase its tax base by supporting a strong and diversified economy of high-growth, high tech companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In January 2007, Pfizer announced that the Ann Arbor facilities -- primarily a large campus on Plymouth Road -- would be closing by the end of 2008. The University of Michigan purchased the Pfizer campus, turning it into the North Campus Research Complex.</p>

Pick up a copy of "<a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/newgeographyofjobs/">The New Geography of Jobs</a>" from <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> to understand the multiplier effect high tech jobs have on local business, and why place matters.</p>

<p>Borders was an Ann Arbor based bookstore that grew from a single store into a worldwide bookselling leader. It closed its doors in 2011 after 40 years in business. This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/12/first.borders.bookstore.closing/index.html">CNN story</a> gives a good history of its rise and fall. <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> is an independent bookstore that opened in Ann Arbor in 2013, inheriting several former Borders employees and a number of its bookshelves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As CEO of a fast-growing high tech company, and mentor and advisor to many other innovative, venture-backed startups here, I can personally testify to the challenges of building a company downtown. All of my prior companies have been split between Ann Arbor and elsewhere, with most of their economic impact (hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs, services, investment, and spin-offs) outside of Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of Dug's prior companies was <a href="http://arbornetworks.com">Arbor Networks</a>, which split itself between Ann Arbor and the Boston area. Arbor was <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2010-press-releases/1994-tektronix-communications-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbor-networks">acquired in 2010</a> by Tektronix Communications, a division of Danaher. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to see us reverse that trend. We have had far too many world-changing technology companies start in Ann Arbor, but leave to grow their people and fortunes elsewhere. It's often for the most mundane of reasons that 20- and 30-somethings here understand all too well.</p>
  
  <p>We need a city council that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, open governance, and good kindergarten skills, but also promotes a vision of positive growth for our community. In today's economy, if we aren't busy growing, we're just slowly dying, and I've been terrified by the Tea Party-like obstructionism I've seen from council members on issues of development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "Tea Party" label has been applied to opponents on City Council before, most notably via the anonymous weblog "Middle of the Left" which uses the term <a href="http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/">Teapublicans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, I support Kirk Westphal, Democratic candidate in Ward 2 for Ann Arbor city council. His vision of a vital, walkable downtown supporting diversity, density, and dynamism is a recipe for <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/">placemaking</a>, and a natural engine for economic growth. We need downtown Ann Arbor to be a real place again and not just a hollowed-out franchise of Traverse City minus the bay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference to "franchise of Traverse City" alludes to several TC based businesses that have set up shop in Ann Arbor, including Cherry Republic and the restaurants Blue Tractor and Jolly Pumpkin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A vote for Kirk is a vote for progress!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did my WILD Saturday night OFF WORK go? Celebrated my friend's, Sarita LH,birthday who is a medic as well with my other awesome medic buddy Tim Skeeters at Rush Street in Ann Arbor. While we were having a great time, 2 gun shots were fired on the dance floor. While everyone stampeded away from the dance floor, we rushed towards it. Before we can think twice we were atop the shooter and the victim. As far as the gentleman who was shot in the abdomen, he with conscious and alert with 2 other great medics stopping the bleeding and keeping him awake. We, then successfully backboarded and loaded the patient. Literally 2 hours later my shift began and now back at work, however getting paid for it this time. </p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324202304579053033444112314">FOIA laws are fueling hedge fund profits</a>. Savvy investors are getting information from government records to help them make decisions before the information is widely known in the market. "One firm, FOI Services Inc., accounted for about 10% of the 50,000 information requests sent to the FDA during the period examined by the Journal."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A review by The Wall Street Journal of more than 100,000 of the roughly three million FOIA requests filed over the past five years, including all of those sent to the FDA, shows that investors use the process to troll for all kinds of information. They ask the Environmental Protection Agency about pollution regulations, the Department of Energy about grants for energy-efficient vehicles, and the Securities and Exchange Commission about whether publicly held companies are under investigation. Such requests are perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Sam Kriss has a wonderful <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/book-of-lamentations/">reading of the psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-5</a>, treating it as a dystopian novel. In the "Book of Lamentations", he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something has gone terribly wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any real fulfillment. The newly published DSM-5 is a classic dystopian novel in this mold.</p>
  
  <p>It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an unwieldy mouthful: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The author (or authors) writes under the ungainly nom de plume of The American Psychiatric Association – although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone; within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd, chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As sent to the Ann Arbor City Clerk, 23 October 2013:</p>

<p>To the clerk:</p>

<p>The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended
discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council
weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to
spend money to replace them.</p>

<p>To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at
council about the state of the lighting, I'd like to make this
request.</p>

<p>Please provide the following records:</p>

<ol>
<li>The most recent inspection and safety reports for the eighty one
(81) street lighting poles referenced in City Council item 13-1062
that were proposed to be replaced, referencing the following Whereas
clause:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas: The Street Lights along Main Street between Huron and
  William are rusting at the base posing a safety issue and are in need
  of replacement; "</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this request is in the public interest, and since the records
have been freshly examined for staff preparation for council, I expect
that the records will be readily available at no charge.</p>

<p>I do not know if the records are in electronic form. If they are in
paper form, and if duplication of records would be necessary to
fulfill this request, please inform me before proceeding so that I can
weigh the costs. If possible, if the records are in paper form I would
like to examine them in person to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

<p>Thanks for your prompt response to this request.</p>

<p>The apple crop in SE Michigan is exceptionally good this year, after last year's horrible crop. From <a href="http://www.goodfruit.com/Good-Fruit-Grower/Web-2013/Large-US-apple-crop-forecast/">GoodFruit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, Michigan produced only 2.7 million bushels of apples, a tenth of a normal crop. This year, the Guesstimate was for a crop of 26.3 million bushels, a number only surpassed once in the last eight years. Michigan’s crop has been highly variable for the last decade, but averages around 20 million bushels.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor City Council decided not to spend general fund money on downtown Ann Arbor street lamps, after inspection of the lamps showed that some of them were rusting at the base. I filed a FOIA request to get recent safety inspection reports.</p>

<p>A friend on the west coast sold his Bitcoin mining equipment, recovering some of the cost of that gear. He reports that mining is very expensive and very competitive and that the remaining money to be made on Bitcoin is in currency speculation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some stories that I'm watching about what's on the Ann Arbor City Council agenda for 21 October 2013.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="A2council-pun-plamondon-1973-a2snooze-cropped" title="A2council-pun-plamondon-1973-a2snooze-cropped" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b002da4b8970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>As usual, the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/20/oct-21-2013-ann-arbor-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a> is a useful guide to the details, and the <a href="https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222612&amp;GUID=EBFC5C3E-0504-4B72-95C6-12815612D619&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting details from Legistar</a> give you the play-by-play.</p>

<p>The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site. Keystone won the RFP, beating out Flight Plan Creative of Traverse City ($24,650) and B+B Marketing Communications of Midland ($40,000). It is to be noted that the award did not go to the low bidder, as the qualifications for the RFP spelled out that price was not the only consideration for the bid.</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township is seeking to join The Ride (The Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority, or AAATA). Vivienne Armentrout has posted an <a href="http://localinannarbor.com/2013/10/19/once-again-aaata-exceeds-its-reach/">article critical of the expansion</a> which drew a stern rebuke from Larry Krieg of Ypsi Township:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an era when we can’t afford either to isolate our communities or to link them solely by private automobiles, the clear path to prosperity in Michigan is through regional cooperation and investing together in alternative forms of transportation. We can’t afford <em>not</em> to make this investment now. Those who think it’s foolish to diversify our transportation options are neglecting the huge expense of our current dependence on automobiles and petroleum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm all for improved service to Ypsilanti Township, but that's at least a little selfish. If service to that part of the area improves, it will be in part due to improvements in service on AAATA Route 5, which goes right by my house. If I lived on the west side of Ann Arbor, I'd be agitating for Scio Township to buy in to transit improvements, because that would likely add to the quality of service of west-side bus routes.</p>

<p>What's not on the agenda is perhaps as important as what's on the agenda. This week's agenda as printed Sunday night does not have any talk of a repeal of the city crosswalk ordinance. That's been getting a lot of press, including this <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/10/stay-vigilant-for-coming-attacks-on.html">piece in Damn Arbor</a> suggesting additional signage to improve motorist recognition of local ordinances. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/10/efforts_underway_to_repeal_ann_arbors_crosswalk_ordinance.html">dot News story</a> suggests that a motion to repeal the ordinance might be on the council's November agenda, perhaps after the elections when there's new faces on the council.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="http://a2gov.org/ctn">CTN</a> is your source for online city council video, and the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council">a2council</a> hash tag on Twitter can help you follow along with the play by play.</p>

      <p>Bush fires are burning in New South Wales, Australia in October 2013. If you are near the fire, you must find a more accurate and timely source of information than this blog post.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24575830">BBC report</a> quotes from a local official:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that "the speed and the ferocity" of the fires was something "not seen for many, many years".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of this writing, the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/more-than-100-homes-destroyed-conditions-set-to-worsen-20131018-2vshk.html">Sydney Morning Herald report</a> is that more than 100 homes have been lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alongside him on Sunny Ridge Road, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes the epic scale of these fires: 86,000 hectares burnt; fire perimeters stretching 400 to 500 kilometres; 94 fires still burning at 2.20pm, 27 uncontained and two with emergency warnings, one on the central coast and one nearby, threatening Springwood High School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google's <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-nsw-bushfires">crisis map of the New South Wales fires</a> is a mirror of the <a href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?CAT_ID=683">New South Wales Rural Fire Service map</a>. The original map is easier to use if you know the names of the fire locations, but the Google map has a few more overlays that can be helpful.</p>

<p>The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press (<a href="http://www.rcfp.org">RCFP</a>) announced a new FOIA generator and FOIA request tracker, "iFOIA", at the ONA '13 conference. From their <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-committee-launches-ifoia-electronic-information-request-filing-and-tracking-system">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iFOIA resource, which is online at <a href="http://www.ifoia.org">www.ifoia.org</a>, is an extension of the Reporters Committee’s popular FOIA Letter Generator, which has been a feature of the organization’s website since 1996. iFOIA can be used on a desktop or mobile device, and allows users to choose whether to keep their correspondence chains with government agencies confidential or share them with designated colleagues, such as editors and lawyers. It also includes a FOIA Wiki for feedback and discussions. Because it automatically organizes all of a reporter’s files, it is designed to help with lawsuits and agency appeals when government stonewalling presents no other option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sent my first request in this morning, a straightforward one that shouldn't require any payment or any appeal, and I'm hopeful that it will work as easily as it seems to work. The site is in beta.</p>

<p>The other FOIA request system to compare it with is the now-venerable <a href="http://www.muckrock.com">Muckrock</a>, which does a similar task. The biggest visible difference with Muckrock is that the iFOIA site doesn't appear to have a one-step straightforward way to share your FOIA request and results with the world. Muckrock serves as both a request and publication platform, and seems to be tuned to publicity and activism; the RCFP system looks like it's designed more for the journalist keeping their work private until it shows up in print.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's more like "inbox three" than "inbox zero" because of a couple of persistent stuck messages, and the todo list is full of items that I put on it ten months ago that still need to be done. That said, I'm still happy with my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">issuetracker system</a>, for which I'm using <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">Github's issues system</a> as a personal productivity tool. It has a long memory, it's reliable, and the mobile tools for managing lists work nicely on my Android phone.</p>

<p>The one thing I'm not completely happy with is how to make sure that things that need to get done every week are done promptly on time. My calendar is not quite a strong enough reminder, and it's not sane to do a todo item every single week for routine events. For daily medication reminders, I've found that <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">Medhelper</a> is single-focused and detailed enough to work well.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/11/addtodo_a_simpl.html">todo list code</a> I released to the net was back in 2005, and it had the feature of being completely manageable from the command line and capable of generating a random task. It looks like it's possible that I could install <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub">ingy's git-hub tool</a> and have things work that way again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It all started in December, when Affinia spun off its brakes unit that makes Raybestos brand of automobile brakes.

<h2>DTE Energy addresses temporary lighting failure at Comerica Park</h2>

<p>DETROIT, Oct. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy's preliminary investigation of the temporary lighting failure that occurred at Comerica Park during Major League Baseball's American League Championship Series (ALCS), has found there was a cable failure in the area near the stadium, which caused the problem.</p>

<p>The lights in the stadium were out for approximately 20 minutes beginning at approximately 4:41 p.m. Power was restored in the stadium at around 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The cable failure caused a voltage reduction, which tripped the lights in the stadium. The momentary sag in voltage was an isolated incident.</p>

<p>DTE Energy maintains two independent electrical feeds for precisely this kind of an event. Both feeds to the park continued to provide power during the incident.</p>

<p>"We've identified the cause of the disturbance and we worked with officials at Comerica Park to resolve the issue quickly," said Steve Kurmas, President and Chief Operating Officer for DTE Electric, a unit of DTE Energy. "We regret the interruption."</p>

<p>DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church of San Pedro in Loboc is the second oldest church in Bohol. It was originally built in 1602, but soon reduced to ashes. In 1638, a stronger one was built. Located near the river, it has survived a number of floods. Inside the church, you can admire some remarkable naive paintings on the ceiling. A Spanish coat of arms can be found in the stone wall near the entrance of the convent. The bell tower of Loboc is about 100 meters from the church.</p>

  <p>Update:   Xerox Resolves EBT System Outage.
  Beneficiary access to programs such as SNAP, TANF, and other programs has been restored to the 17 States where Xerox provides EBT service.  Re-starting the EBT system required time to ensure service was back at full functionality.  Beneficiaries who required immediate access to their benefits could work with their local merchants who could activate an emergency voucher process where available. We appreciate our clients’ patience while we resolved this issue and apologize for any inconvenience. We realize that access to these benefits is important to families in the states we serve. We continue to investigate the cause of the issue so we can take steps to ensure a similar interruption does not re-occur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a routine test of our back-up systems Saturday morning,  Xerox’s Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system experienced a temporary shutdown. While the system is now up and running, beneficiaries in the 17 affected states continue to experience connectivity issues to access their benefits. This disruption impacts EBT beneficiaries who rely on the system for SNAP and WIC. Technical staff is addressing the issue and expect the system to be restored soon.  Beneficiaries requiring access to their benefits can work with their local retailers who can activate an emergency voucher system where available.

  <p>Sheree Powell, Director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, also told NBC10 affiliate KFOR that the system failure is the result of a power outage at a Xerox facility. EBT cards in several states are powered by a company that Xerox owns called ACS, Inc.
  "We are getting updated in real time," said <a href="http://news.xerox.com/contacts">Karen Arena</a>, a spokeswoman for Xerox.

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia Bryan, public information officer for the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the problems stemmed from a power outage at the main data center for Xerox, the vendor for EBT cards in Mississippi and 16 other states across the nation. The outage caused equipment problems that led to cards being declined at stores across the state. Bryan said Xerox reported that the issue should be resolved shortly, but no specific time frame was available. "This has nothing to do with the federal government shutdown," Bryan said.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm putting together a few mobile apps (in the form of mobile web sites) that are designed for small-screen phone use. Here's what's in the works. Each of these are likely to change over time, so don't get too fond of anything just yet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/a2trees.html">a2trees</a> app provides some kind of on-the-go listing of street trees in Ann Arbor that are interesting. The observation that there is a great apple crop in 2013 and that there are city trees laden with nice apples just waiting to be picked was the motivation. It's really bare-bones now, with not more more in the way of detail than my old <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/07/amelanchier-shadbush-juneberry-sugar-plum-inventory-for-ann-arbor-2009.html">juneberry listing</a> post, except neatly set up for mobile use.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/index.html">mobile web</a> app is self-referential in that it tries to collect useful bookmarks to mobile-ready versions of things like newspaper, bus, weather, netnews, and other web pages specially formatted for mobile use. I got tired of typing in the URL to fetch the bus listing so I put it on a menu. This is an up-to-dated version of the list I kept of <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~emv/m/">mobile sites on monkey.org</a> dating back about 5 years from when I had a Blackberry and was collecting same. The project is <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">up on Github</a> (and has been for the past 5 years!) but there's not much more to look at than data. Please do feel free to give me feedback there as well as here.</p>

<p>Finally two power outage related mobile sites. The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index.html">mobile power outage maps</a> collection is a slow but sure approach to turning my popular <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> blog post into something more tidy for the small screen. The state it's in is functional but not complete, and I expect I'll chip away at it as storms or outages warrant. A second and new app for me is a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index-ziplookup.html">utility company finder</a> site that takes as its input the first three digits of a zip code and returns the utility companies that serve that area, or type the utility name and get back a list of 3-digit zips it serves. The big caveats on this are that it's slow, slow, slow, and that the data set it's derived from is nominally from 2011 but shows many signs of not being kept up to date with utility mergers and name changes since then.</p>

<p>All of these "mobile" things are browser-based right now, so you can try them from whatever system you are likely to be typing at. They use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> for the fancy bits, and I'm pretty happy so far in just how far I get with that system using HTML do to the work and not having to write a bunch of Javascript to get things to work. On the server side I have been generating these as static sites using old-fashioned Unix shell scripts and makefiles, and though it's not elegant by any means, it is well within exactly the kind of coding environment I've been using since the 1980s.</p>

  <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a health alert warning that an estimated 278 illnesses caused by Salmonella Heidelberg are associated with raw chicken produced by Foster Farms at three facilities in California.</p>
  
  <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says illnesses have been reported in 17 states, with the vast majority — 78 percent — in California. The outbreak is ongoing, so it's possible that people are still being sickened by the chicken.</p>
  
  <p>The CDC says about 42 percent of the people who've gotten sick (among those for whom information is available) have been hospitalized. The strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that have made people sick are resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. And according to the CDC, the resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or make the illness tougher to treat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This public health alert is being issued after an estimated 278 illnesses were recently reported in 18 states, predominantly in California.  The outbreak is continuing. The investigations indicate that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken and other brand chicken produced at Foster Farms plants are the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg infections. Illnesses were linked to Foster Farms brand chicken through epidemiologic, laboratory and traceback investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS continues its investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CDC has been hampered in tracing the outbreak because the government shutdown meant the agency had to shut down PulseNet, a national network of public health laboratories that looks for trends and matches reports to spot food-borne illness outbreaks. It's one of the agency's most important tools in detecting such problems.</p>
  
  <p>"We were trying to do this without the automatic system, and it was nearly impossible," Reynolds said. Seven of the eight staffers who run the system were furloughed. "We were doing it by hand, and it just become untenable."</p>
  
  <p>CDC director Thomas Frieden determined that not having PulseNet was resulting in "an imminent threat to health and safety," a finding that allowed the agency to bring back the seven staffers, Reynolds said Tuesday. "It's back up and running as of today."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PulseNet compares the 'DNA fingerprints' of bacteria from patients to find clusters of disease that might represent unrecognized outbreaks. Health officials can't stop an outbreak, and industry and regulatory agencies can't make changes to our food and water delivery systems, if they don't know that outbreaks are occurring. That's where PulseNet comes in.</p>

  <p>“Salmonella is naturally occurring in poultry and can be fully eradicated if raw product is properly handled and fully cooked,” said Dr. Robert O’Connor, the company’s food safety chief and head veterinarian. “All poultry producers strive to reduce bacterial presence, including Salmonella. We take food safety very seriously. When the incidence of illnesses linked to Salmonella increased, we wanted to know why and we have worked quickly to identify and implement additional controls. It is also important to reassure the public that the FSIS process has not been affected by the recent government shutdown.”</p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.</p>

<p>Council discussed the situation in Portland, Oregon. <a href="http://consumerist.com/2013/05/20/when-you-cut-trash-collection-to-every-two-weeks-parents-will-still-find-a-way-to-get-rid-of-dirty-diapers/">Consumerist</a> notes that parents there are recycling their dirty poopy diapers.

<blockquote>
  <p>“It started when the city went to every other week garbage pickup,” the president of Far West Fibers, which handles much of the curbside recycling for Portland, tells Oregon Public Broadcasting. “Prior to that you’d get a dirty diaper maybe once a month. Now we get 60 pounds per shift. It’s not pretty.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">Healthcare.GOV</a>, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/05/us-usa-healthcare-technology-analysis-idUSBRE99407T20131005">Reuters took a look at the issue</a>, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. For instance, when a user tries to create an account on HealthCare.gov, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, it prompts the computer to load an unusually large amount of files and software, overwhelming the browser, experts said. If they are right, then just bringing more servers online, as officials say they are doing, will not fix the site.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/in-debut-affordable-care-web-site-baffles-many-users/">New York Times reported on the site's debut</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the site took three years to build, it took only a few minutes for it to break down when it went live at 8 a.m. E.D.T. Some consumers said they were met with an error message in the early morning when trying to visit the Web site, which seemed to be overwhelmed with traffic and limited by apparent programming issues. Many people took to Twitter and Facebook to note that the site was down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/04/obamacare-disaster-or-routine-maintenance/">MSNBC asks</a> - disaster or routine maintenance?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HHS officials said that they will be taking down the “application part of the website” for scheduled maintenance this weekend, according to NBC News’ Kristin Welker. The announcement was red meat for critics of Obamacare, who have been largely silent since the health care law rolled out earlier this week. Speaker John Boehner said the administration’s announcement was proof that “the president’s health care law has been an unmitigated disaster.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, no reliable reports that I've been able to find blame the problem on a specific denial of service attack; rather, it appears to be a combination of sudden demand for the service, teething pains for a new site, and system complexity. I did not note any commentary from the Arbor Networks <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/asert/">ASERT</a> weblog, which writes about DDOS attacks. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/">Renesys</a>, usually a useful view on problems, is reporting on Internet downtime in Sudan and Syria. My heads-up site for Internet-wide problems, the <a href="http://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages">outages mailing list</a>, is silent. Strangely, the place I'd expect to have seen this show up - the automated news aggregator <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/131007/p12#a131007p12">Techmeme</a> - is also quiet (Update: see below for Techmeme coverage). The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/obamacare">Obamacare Reddit subboard</a> has some reports from people who made it through the system, and others who are having problems.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the problems like these are in the software. Hardware is the easy part. You can add more hardware and do it easily. Software takes more time. In the rush of getting this out, it seems like testing wasn’t done completely. My expectations from this is that these problems should go away in the next few weeks. The site still won’t be as fast as something like Netflix, but it should work.</p>
