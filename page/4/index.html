<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>This is a copy of a proposal for a talk at the Radical/Networks conference.
<a href="https://github.com/chootka/radical-networks/issues/27">The original proposal</a>
is on Github.
The event runs October 24th and 25th (Saturday +
Sunday) from 10a - 7p at NYU Poly in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

<p>Title: Over the top networks, a history of building new systems on the wreckage of the old</p>

<p>New networks often feed off of old ones, in ways that characteristically
draw energy from aspects of those networks that are easy to take
over and hard to defend. In this talk, I&rsquo;ll look at the waves of
creative destruction that are unleashed when network developers
find existing infrastructure that can be exploited for new ends,
and the ways that commoditized networks fight back to avoid being
turned into dumb pipes.</p>

<p>The talk will look at the history and the future of these overlay
or over-the-top networks, going back three decades for stories of
networks like Usenet, electronic mail, and payments networks and
how they started out parasitizing existing older networks only be
overtopped by other interests as file sharing, security, and identity
layers of newer networks. I&rsquo;ll look at rules for developers of
radical advances in networks and guidelines to avoid the pitfalls
of unexpected dependencies and hidden traps.</p>

<p>Edward Vielmetti has been working on the Internet since 1985 from
Ann Arbor, Michigan. His background includes work on the early
commercialization and privatization of the Internet. Previous
conference presentations include &ldquo;WYSSA means all my love, darling:
A social history of the Internet from the carrier pigeon to Antarctic
morse code&rdquo; (UPA 2006) and &ldquo;Perils and Pitfalls of Practical
Cybercommerce&rdquo; (ARABANK 1996, Dubai, United Arab Emirates).</p>

      <p>I have a new terabyte drive. It&rsquo;s impossibly small, impossibly
cheap, and just fast enough to accomplish astounding backup tasks
in what seems like not enough time.</p>

<p>It is, however, a mass storage device that depends on rotating
magnetic media, and as such it&rsquo;s obsolete.</p>

<p>The drive cost less than $50. For about 10 times that right now,
I can buy another terabyte drive that is solid state rather than
spinning oxide storage. The bet that I have is that in three years,
the cost of a terabyte of SSD drive will have come down so far -
perhaps to $100 - that no one will have any interest in selling me
a 1T drive that isn&rsquo;t SSD.</p>

<p>My frame of reference for &ldquo;what does har drive storage cost&rdquo; dates
back as far as the 10 megabyte, $1000 drive, which I really wanted
and which I never bought for my own self. And then back a little bit
further, when a 5 megabyte Davong drive was the bee&rsquo;s knees.</p>

<p>What do you do with a terabyte? Lots of backups.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-26-rrdtool-on-raspberry-pi/">RRDTool v1.5.4 on Raspberry Pi</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The second in a series of efforts to get a suitable database for
the task.</p>

<p>The challenge is that there&rsquo;s a lot of data out there that changes
all the time, and you want to gather it, make sure it&rsquo;s sane, squirrel
it away for later analysis, put together a pretty chart so that you
can spot check it, feed it into other systems not yet fully dreamed
of to cause actions, and so on. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;big data&rdquo; problem in that
you have sensors that throw off a lot of data exhaust, and it&rsquo;s the
&ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; problem because mostly you&rsquo;re looking at things
with data and not say imagery or lots of freeform text.</p>

<p>Phase one of this effort was wrestling MongoDB into service, which
ended up being only a handful of lines of code; but the concern expressed
was the Mongo though fun and easy for small projects gets messy for
big ones, and there&rsquo;s good reason not to succumb to its siren song.
The other reason to stop using Mongo when I did was that it really
doesn&rsquo;t love the Raspberry Pi architecture. Since there were only really
a very few lines of code, and since that code works on my Mac, no time
lost - but time to move on.</p>

<p>Phase two is a look at RRDtool, a &ldquo;round robin&rdquo; database very often used
for network management efforts. One of the nice things about a round robin
database is that the database itself is at its maximum size when you
create it, and it doesn&rsquo;t grow - rather, it cycles out the old data
at whatever time resolution you want to get rid of it. With that in
mind you can have a single database with 10 years worth of daily averages
and a whole year of minute-by-minute data and it hardly takes up any
room at all - perfect for the sort of &ldquo;data logger&rdquo; applications that
I find myself in the middle of.</p>

<p>If you do <code>apt-get install rrdtool</code> on the Pi you get a working
copy of RRDtool 1.4.7, compiled in 2012. That&rsquo;s pretty long in the
tooth, so I decided to pull down v1.5.4 from the
<a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/?M=D">RRDtool download area</a>. The release notes note
dependencies as follows</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install libpango1.0-dev libxml2-dev
</code></pre>

<p>and once you have those pulled down the build is not fast but not
difficult.</p>

<p>Pushing data into RRDtool is as simple as a shell script run out of
cron. The first data point I&rsquo;m graphing is &ldquo;total spaces free in the
Ann Arbor DDA parking garages&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m collecting that on two machines -
my Mac when it&rsquo;s running, and the Pi at all times. A second graph
I want to capture is some really basic weather information, and a
third is inside-the-machine environmental sensing starting with the
system temperature of the Pi.</p>

<p>It was really useful to make the first round of this be Mongo, because
with Mongo you really don&rsquo;t have to decide anything when you set things up -
just dump in raw JSON documents and hope for the best.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-26-first-pass-at-mongodb/">First pass at MongoDB</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Somehow I never learned SQL along the way. At various times I have
learned enough of the database lingo (inner join, outer join etc) to
know where I missing things, and I have a lot of experience with common
Unix tools (grep, sed, awk) and some newfangled tools (jq, csvkit) to
be able to turn a big pile of data into a smaller pile of data. But
I don&rsquo;t have database chops per se right now, and sometimes that&rsquo;s a
limiting factor on projects when the data sets are too big.</p>

<p>JSON formatted data seems to have won the data serialization wars, so
that at least transforms the problem on input; with jq (now in release 1.5)
you can take a stream of JSON formatted data that&rsquo;s almost what you want
and mangle it until it&rsquo;s really what you want. Lots of web APIs spit out
some flavor of JSON, and even if it&rsquo;s not precisely formatted to be ready
for input into something else, at least there&rsquo;s a straightforward way to
munge it into something better.</p>

<p>That leaves the task of dumping these JSON blobs into a database, in
such a way that you can relatively easily get something back out of the
database that answers what you are really trying to answer again. Here
the world splits into two pieces: the SQL databases that have been taught
how to deal with JSON (specifically PostgreSQL, as of version 9.3), and the
so-called NoSQL databases (specifically MongoDB).</p>

<p>Even Mongo knows that <a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/62899600960/scaling-advice-from-mongohq">scaling MongoDB is hard</a>, though
they frame it as the first 100 gigabytes of data stored in the system is
easy. Fortunately, the first set of tasks I have to throw at this particular
problem space are relatively small, databases measured in the 10s of megabytes.
Pretty much anything will work - even grep - on this size data. The
challenge becomes more of a how fast can you get something real running
that has relatively simple queries, relatively performant results, and
that can run on inexpensive hardware.</p>

<p>So I learned just enough Mongo to handle one tiny task: connect to an API,
download some data periodically, clean it up enough so that it&rsquo;s regular,
and store it away; and then construct queries that are conceptually simple
but that answer real questions. From there, do the ad hoc queries that prove
to yourself that you have the right data, and then bootstrap some web
app on top of all that to show off what you&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>The results here accomplish a relatively complex task with a handful of
lines of code. An API from a local agency is queried that has real time data.
That data gets cleaned up and standardized and then inserted into a Mongo
database. It&rsquo;s all of 6 lines of code.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m listening to Radio Havana Cuba via a shortwave listening post set up
with a software defined radio. The system, <a href="http://blerp2.dyndns.org:8901/">Great Lakes Listening Post</a>,
has four separate radios covering the 80, 40, 30, and 20 meter bands, all
fed into the <a href="http://www.websdr.org">WebSDR</a> software from PA3FWM. It&rsquo;s
located in Michigan, and thus approximates the radio reception I&rsquo;d get from
my own receiver.</p>

<p>R Havana Cuba is a good station to listen to. There&rsquo;s interesting political
commentary, fun music, and the occasional show about shortwave listening.
The signal is usually strong and the frequency (6000 kHz) is easy to remember.
Most international braodcasters have refocused their attention on Internet
based broadcasts, but R Havana Cuba continues on with its shortwave service.
My Sony ICF-2010 set from the 1980s still has a Cold War era present to that
frequency.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage to web-based software radio is the ability to pick up
stations from listening posts around the world. The WebSDR platform has stations
with good antennas around the world, and they each allow multiple listeners
to tune in to different stations without any of them monopolizing the receiver.
Most web-based SDR systems focus on shortwave and HF amateur bands, but every
so often you find a system that can tune domestic medium wave (AM) and
long wave bands, which gives you a chance to hear programs that were
never anticipated to be listened to from half way around the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/khaytsus/gqrx-scan">gqrx-scan</a> is a Perl script
that drives the remote control of the <a href="http://gqrx.dk/">gqrx</a> software
defined radio receiver to turn it into a scanner and automated recording tool.</p>

<p>The GQRX <a href="http://gqrx.dk/doc/remote-control">remote control protocol</a> is
well documented and fairly simple, which means that the bulk of the
Perl script has to do with setting and getting options. You can drive
your scanner from the GQRX configuration file, or you can monitor
a specific band or range of frequencies. It will even toggle the record
mode in GQRX so that you can save what you&rsquo;re listening to a file.</p>

<p>Because the system is driven from a file, I would like to see more
example files in the distribution - e.g. one that had all of the
GMRS/FRS frequencies already typed in so that you could start scanning
those bands immediately. But that&rsquo;s a quibble, and more to the point
that&rsquo;s something that I can do next when the next time I&rsquo;m ready to
contribute to the project.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some
time now, and since November I&rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.</p>

<p>Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything
that I&rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &ldquo;backlog&rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to
less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&rsquo;s usually a lot
of duplicates; at less than 100 I&rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&rsquo;s
something to be done). The &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; and &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; queues hold no more than
5 tasks apiece, since I want to keep everything in that state visible on
the screen. Finally the &ldquo;Done&rdquo; queue reflects how much work there is that
actually got accomplished over the last week, and I&rsquo;d love to say that was
hovering at about 50 tasks a week though right now it&rsquo;s only at 34.</p>

<p>Github issues are more than capable of handling a personal todo list - indeed
it has a lot of features that if you tried to use all of them you&rsquo;d quickly
find that too much of your time was perfecting your lists and not enough
time was spent doing things. So the challenge is coming up with a simple
configuration of the system that doesn&rsquo;t ignore what might be done, but that
focuses on what really needs to be done.</p>

<p>The inspriation for all of this is Jim Benson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Personal Kanban&rdquo;, and his
observation that really the task simplifies down to two rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limit work in progress</li>
<li>Visualize your work</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest is merely commentary.</p>

<p>(Now I get to drag task 3568, &ldquo;Write up use of Waffle for Vacuum blog&rdquo;, into the
&ldquo;Done&rdquo; category, which is kinetically very satisfactory.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Council meets at 7:00 p.m. on Monday, 17 August 2015.
A preview of the agenda is on Arborwiki, complete with a map, on the
tag <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/tags/20150817ccmtg">2015-08-17CCMTG</a>.</p>

<p>Some highlights to note:</p>

<p>The consent agenda includes $36,412 for the purchase of 21 Taser weapons.
This is a sole-source purchase, to replace weapons purchased in 2003.</p>

<p>Also on the consent agenda is $83,000 for a sole-source purchase to
renew the CityWorks license, which is used for asset tracking and
maintenance of city owned resources. Of that amount, $20,000 will be
billed back to the Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner.</p>

<p>$110,000 would go for the continuation of CLEMIS Public Safety Information
Sharing Services for the Ann Arbor Police Department for FY2016. CLEMIS
runs the dispatch system for police and allows &ldquo;information sharing&rdquo;
with other departments. It&rsquo;s run by Oakland County.</p>

<p>HathiTrust has digitized many decades of Ann Arbor City Council minutes,
and it it proposed that the city approve publication of those minutes through
HathiTrust by clearing the copyright on those materials.</p>

<p>Public hearings include one on deer management, and there&rsquo;s a proposal
on the agenda to spend $90,000 on some combination of a deer cull by
sharpshooters and sterlization of deer. Expect this to be a long public
hearing.</p>

<p>In development news, there&rsquo;s a proposed condominium development on N Main St
adjacent to North Main Park, and hearings on proposed annexations on Nixon
Road and on Ann Arbor - Saline Road.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re following the footing drain disconnect program closely, you&rsquo;ll
note that there&rsquo;s a proposal to lend the builder of 618 South Main
footing drain disconnect credits to allow for full occupancy of that building.</p>

<p>More of course at the full agenda. See you on the site plan barricades
(er, see you at council).</p>

      <p>This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly
removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and
social media reports. Social media users have reported that their
posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &ldquo;Tianjin&rdquo;
and &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo.
Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also
reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television
was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas.
Tianjin authorities banned reporters from sharing information about
the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites have been advised
to follow state media. The Tianjin Internet Police &ldquo;warned
social media users to stick to official reports about the number
of dead and injured&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A CNN correspondent, Will Ripley, who took photos outside TEDA
Hospital (Chinese: 泰达医院) was interrupted in a live report by
upset friends and relatives of victims killed and injured in the
blasts.</p>

<p>Lots of things were discussed, here&rsquo;s a few of them:</p>

      <p>Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&rsquo;d like to sort out how
to have more long form writing.</p>

<p>From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with
structure. It&rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring
a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome.</p>

<p>I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven
knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-07-all-watched-over-by-machines/">All watched over by machines</a>
      </h3>
      <p>As it turns out, a detailed look at the way you spend time over
the course of a day online yields several fascinating conclusions.
As previously noted, <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Wakatime</span> is the introspective tool of choice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Gee, that&rsquo;s a lot of time to look at Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail;</li>
<li>Why aren&rsquo;t you spending more of your productive time writing;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll bet that if you put down the computer your day would be more productive.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, #2 is the most interesting one. Of course time spent on Facebook,
Twitter, and Gmail is time spent writing, but it&rsquo;s transactional writing -
short bursts of functional prose to negotiate a time, set up a plan,
make a clever comeback or otherwise do online chit-chat. The words are writing,
but there&rsquo;s not a body of work that you can point to that&rsquo;s of any size as
your opus from that hour plus spent.</p>

<p>Productive is a very funny word when you&rsquo;re being watched by a machine.
Some parts of the time are marked as &ldquo;good time&rdquo;, where you&rsquo;re happy to
have an extra minute spent credited to a project or task. Not all time is
&ldquo;good time&rdquo;, though some of the non-good time is just as essential, just
measured differently. And then there&rsquo;s the occasional glitch in the matrix
where time is credited or blamed on one thing but you could swear you were
doing something else at the time.</p>

<p>Time spent on task sometimes looks very small when all of these are taken into
account. Those 99 words you wrote for publication were edited down from 150,
and might be edited further down to 55. If you could precisely allocate all
of the time you spent on it it would include the musing and ruminations, but
that got chalked up to Gmail where it&rsquo;s mixed in with the time spent deleting
mail.</p>

<p>I like to know what I&rsquo;m doing, but it&rsquo;s wrong to mix up inputs and outputs.
If your system measures inputs, you get ritualized behavior designed to
maximize time spent on task, no matter how the time is actually used.
Maximizing outputs would yield word counts and not minute counts. If you&rsquo;re
slow and terse, there&rsquo;s no help for you.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">a2b3</span> lunch this week was at
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Mi Compadre</span>, a Mexican place on Packard.
We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.</p>

<p>I was inspired this week for the lunch question by
going to the <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Workantile</span> lunch on Wednesday,
which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce
yourself around the table, and answer some simple question.
At Workantile the prompt was simply &ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&rdquo;,
and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery.</p>

<p>When lunches are well attended, it seems to be that it happens
because the news gets out in plenty of time and plenty of detail
on Facebook. Not everyone in my world does Facebook, but there&rsquo;s
more people there than on Twitter or Meetup, and it appears that
Facebook might now have the tools for lunch organizing that it didn&rsquo;t
have a year ago when I started using Meetup for that purpose.</p>

<p>So with the help of <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Tom Meloche</span> it looks like I&rsquo;m going
to move the primary ritual of notifying people where the next meeting is
through a Facebook event, and move away from Meetup as the primary organizing
tool. That&rsquo;s going to take a few months to pull off but it looks like
the right organizing tool for 2015.</p>

<p>I miss the olden days when <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">eGroups</span> was so novel that
you could build an instant community around an easy to run mailing
list. Yahoo so completely missed the boat when they turned that
into Yahoo Groups over a decade ago. I&rsquo;ll keep the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/a2b3">a2b3 Yahoo group</a> around indefinitely -
it&rsquo;s free after all, and it&rsquo;s old - but it&rsquo;s not growing and
working on a system that doesn&rsquo;t support growth is a recipe for
stagnatation. Where I used to count on a new person every week from
Yahoo Groups I now only get 10-15 new subscribers a year.</p>


  <h3>5 August 2015</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-05-wakatime/">wakatime, an automatic time tracker for programmers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Wakatime tracks your time if you&rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by
integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your
favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then
matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects
stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard.
&ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&rdquo; is the tag line.</p>

<p>That which is measured, improves. I don&rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve
your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind. What I do
know is that manually tracking your time is a pain, and that anything
you can do to manage to keep things running in your time accounting
system that doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of manual labor is very helpful.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that you generally don&rsquo;t spend all of your
time inside a text editor. (But maybe you should! Just think how much
more productive you&rsquo;d be.) Wakatime can be set up to also track you
in Chrome and pinpoint just how many hours per day get
absorbed by Twitter or Gmail or Facebook.</p>

<p>If I know myself, this is going to be a temporary enthusiasm. My
experience with the whole &ldquo;quanitifed self&rdquo; world is to know that
some months in the summer, my normal step count is well over 10000,
and that in the winter time it&rsquo;s well under 10000, just because of
Michigan&rsquo;s grey February. Benchmarking time spent sometimes makes you
work more mindfully, and sometimes just recognizes immutable human
issues that no amount of mechanical impetus will change.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every day, computers are making people easier and easier to use.
(David Tempkin, In Formation)</p>

<p><a href="https://x.ai?rf=8o4arg">x.ai</a> has a new service in development, an automated
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">personal assistant</span>
that helps you schedule meetings. You give it - or I should
say &ldquo;her&rdquo;, because the bot&rsquo;s name is <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Amy Ingram</span> -
you give Amy your calendar and some simple instructions, and &ldquo;she&rdquo;
manages the correspondence with the person you&rsquo;re trying to meet
with.</p>

<p>The service is very new, so new that it&rsquo;s the subject of breathless
enthusiasm about how wonderful it works in media accounts. Suddenly
people who never have had a personal assistant work for them get
access to an automaton who behaves like a well trained and inhumanly
efficient personal scheduler, and they get excited.</p>

<p>For what is a personal assistant anyway but a carefully programmed
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">protocol droid</span>,
something who knows the expressions that are used
to work your way onto someone&rsquo;s calendar. Having been trained with
the likes of Siri, we collectively know how useful it is to have a bot
teach us how to ask questions in an easy to parse, formalized way.
x.ai&rsquo;s Amy invokes all of our ritual behavior when it comes to understanding
how to deal with the gatekeepers to the powerful and busy, and wraps
that up in an algorithm.</p>

<p>Naturally I&rsquo;ve signed up to be on the beta.</p>

it was a human or machine that sent the message on their behalf.
With an assistants-as-app, the distinction between who&rsquo;s doing the
messaging isn&rsquo;t always clear — sometimes it&rsquo;s a bot and sometimes
it’s not.</p>

<p>From there on in, organizing meetings became a breeze. Those who
didn&rsquo;t know me too well didn&rsquo;t question the fact that I was adding
Amy into our conversations. Those who did were just as incredulous

I would have got my people to speak to your people.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan
to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and
Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup
of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when
voter turnout is very low.</p>

<p>I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating
victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining
funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on,
or the perpetually politically curious.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After a few rounds of picking up result tapes from Ward Four precincts, I ended up
at Arbor Brewing Company which was Council Party HQ.</p>

<p>Winners:</p>

<ul>
<li>First Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Sabra Briere</span> over Will Leaf, handily with 70%+ of the vote,
though only 6% of registered voters actually voted.</li>
<li>Second Ward: We&rsquo;ll wait until the fall for this as Jane Lumm (I) meets
Sally Hart Petersen (D) in November.</li>
<li>Third Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Zachary Ackerman</span> defeats Steve Kunselman by about 40 votes.
This was the surprise of the night. Ackerman&rsquo;s entire margin of victory was
his strong showing in 3-3 (Burns Park) where he outpaced Kunselman 345-171.
Turnout was under 11%.</li>
<li>Fourth Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Jack Eaton</span> defeats Jamie Magiera with about 60% of the vote.
Jack held his party at Wolverine Brewing; Jamie was at ABC, looking subdued.
Turnout was about 10%.</li>
<li>Fifth Ward: <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Chip Smith</span> defeated Mike Anglin with about 55% of the vote.
Voter turnout in the mighty Fifth Ward was strong compared to the other wards,
with a mighty 14% of the electorate turning out to vote.</li>
</ul>

<p>Losers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 85%+ of Ann Arbor voters who didn&rsquo;t know enough or didn&rsquo;t bother
to turn out to vote.</li>

      <p>In the case of experts &ldquo;writing down what they know&rdquo;, and
incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base.</p>

<p>One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down
everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&rsquo;s
no internal inconsistencies.</p>

<p>The world usually works in such a way that it&rsquo;s changing fast enough
that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is
always holding as &ldquo;true&rdquo; in that memory bank something that is
demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under
them. Even if you have an iron-clad commitment to keeping the
memory bank narrowly scoped and revisiting every element of it to
refresh it periodically, the nature of written memory is to grow more and more
out of date or to consume more and more resources to keep fresh.</p>

<p>The map is not the territory - and even if by some miracle the map
at one time was perfectly matched with the world - the world changes
fast enough that we can&rsquo;t know any more than a small part of it.</p>

read the Eno quote, and a search for it turns up William James saying
the same thing in 1892, but Eno is easier to remember as a source.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to,
in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&rsquo;s one
way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.</p>

<p>The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely
gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have
obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages.
Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of
content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many
advertisements as we will stand.</p>

<p>Still, blogrolls are useful as a quaint reminder of times past,
and how we once organized our reading in the days before efficient
newsfeeds became the rule of the day.  Look at the bottom of the
far left of this blog for mine.</p>
