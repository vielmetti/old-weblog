        <p>When you successfully install something complex, and then you fail to document one small thing about how you did it, the inclination is to over-document once you get it working again; thus, this expository account of managing a set of Raspberry Pi devices using the &ldquo;salt&rdquo; system. It&rsquo;s not a complete start to finish writeup, just a pointer to the bits that I had forgotten. This is mostly experimental at this point, and the collection of devices is relatively small. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-07-managing-raspberry-pi-openvpn-with-salt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I think this whole &ldquo;deep web&rdquo; thing is mis-stated for the most part. Since forever there have been Internet-based services that have been unreachable to the public unless you had some kind of specialized access. Private internal networks are the norm at companies of any size. Calling that the &ldquo;hidden web&rdquo;, &ldquo;deep web&rdquo; is non-sensical in that it&rsquo;s not really hidden to anyone who has proper access to it - it&rsquo;s just that you (and Google) don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t have that access. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-04-deep-web/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a new terabyte drive. It&rsquo;s impossibly small, impossibly cheap, and just fast enough to accomplish astounding backup tasks in what seems like not enough time.

For about 10 times that right now, I can buy another terabyte drive that is solid state rather than spinning oxide storage. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-29-terabytes-at-least-in-theory/">&raquo;</a></p>

It&rsquo;s located in Michigan, and thus approximates the radio reception I&rsquo;d get from my own receiver.

        <p>gqrx-scan is a Perl script that drives the remote control of the gqrx software defined radio receiver to turn it into a scanner and automated recording tool. The GQRX remote control protocol is well documented and fairly simple, which means that the bulk of the Perl script has to do with setting and getting options. You can drive your scanner from the GQRX configuration file, or you can monitor a specific band or range of frequencies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-23-gqrx-scanner/">&raquo;</a></p>

Most everything that I&rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &ldquo;backlog&rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to less than 100 just to keep myself sane.

        <p>This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China. Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and social media reports. Social media users have reported that their posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &ldquo;Tianjin&rdquo; and &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo. Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-14-tianjin-explosion/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Lunch at The Broken Egg with the a2b3 crew. We had 17 people show up, which is about 2x what had been the normal attendance. The restaurant was very accomodating, and everyone was well fed. Organizing lunch is the highlight of my week. Lots of things were discussed, here&rsquo;s a few of them: The Perseid meteor shower peaked last night, notes Linda Diane Feldt, who saw a few shooting stars from her cabin in Lyndon Township. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-13-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary-broken-egg/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&rsquo;d like to sort out how to have more long form writing. From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with structure. It&rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome. I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-09-long-form/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The a2b3 lunch this week was at Mi Compadre, a Mexican place on Packard. We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos. I was inspired this week for the lunch question by going to the Workantile lunch on Wednesday, which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce yourself around the table, and answer some simple question. At Workantile the prompt was simply &ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&rdquo;, and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-06-a2b3-mi-compadre-non-summary/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Wakatime tracks your time if you&rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard. &ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&rdquo; is the tag line. That which is measured, improves. I don&rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-05-wakatime/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when voter turnout is very low. I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on, or the perpetually politically curious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In the case of experts &ldquo;writing down what they know&rdquo;, and incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base. One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&rsquo;s no internal inconsistencies. The world usually works in such a way that it&rsquo;s changing fast enough that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is always holding as &ldquo;true&rdquo; in that memory bank something that is demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/">&raquo;</a></p>
