I took notes in a quadrille notebook   for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-a2b3-meeting-non-summary-june-2-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning that Jim Tressel has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&#39;s leadership of the program, culminating in an NCAA investigation.
For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the Dead Schembechlers. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&#39;s best to have a &quot;holy rivalry&quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &quot;New Wolverine Order&quot;, the &quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&quot;, or the &quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-30-tressel-dead-schembechlers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Lightning hit a brick chimney at Ann Arbor&#39;s Northside Elementary School on Wednesday at about 4:15 p.m., sending bricks flying 100 feet through the school pickup area. Fortunately, no one was hurt, as the area was vacant except for a staff member&#39;s vehicle which was damaged by flying brick.
I was aware of this when it happened because the lightning strike was powerful enough to cause the power grid to bounce, prompting comments on Twitter and speculating on the exact location. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-26-may-storm-northside-lightning/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The river is high. Will it flood? That&#39;s a very good question to ask in the morning before a storm; and the answer today turned out to be yes. Roads were inundated, Lake Barracuda emerged from its stormwater geyser, Depot Street filled with water, Mullholland Creek popped a manhole cover, and S. Main Street near Michigan Stadium filled. West Park&#39;s new water features get a workout.
Basements have taken on water, and the full extent of storm damage is unknown yet until we get the May 26 predicted rains. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-26-huron-river-may-2011-flood/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act requires 18 hours advance notice of special meetings, and even less time (though I am not clear how much less time) for special meetings of committees. Thus, if you were not on a mailing list (with a relatively small number of people on the list), you did not receive notice directly of this meeting which is needed to resolve the City of Ann Arbor and the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority&#39;s mutual disagreements over the city budget. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-24-a2dda-aacitycouncil-notice/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Two years ago, the state of the art in local news aggregation was outside.in. That site aggregated postings about a specific geographical area and offered up a web based user interface to republish those links on your web site. Outside.in did not have its own staff of reporters, and its automated systems for newsgathering were (to be charitable) fallible, and thus it sometimes threw up junk of various kinds which was unpleasant to wade through. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-24-patch-local-news-aggregation-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This weblog has more than 2000 posts in it, and from time to time I sift through it looking at old work looking to make it better.
I can see that my writing improves to the extent that I believe that other people will read it. The best written pieces are publishable, at least in the modern web sense of publishable. The ones that need improvement usually need a new lead paragraph, a bunch of formatting cleanup, and some kind of conclusion. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-23-re-editing-old-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an overly simplified description of the process by which you can learn about, and participate in, more public meetings on more topics of public interest than you could possibly attend in person - without ever relying on someone else&#39;s account of what transpired at that meeting.

The one constant is that everyone seems to have gotten a lot of rain. Here&#39;s a map of the last 7 days of precipitation.

I&rsquo;ve been making a point when I visit the school to pick up or drop off J. to make a pass past the lost and found and put anything on a hanger that could possibly go onto a hanger.
