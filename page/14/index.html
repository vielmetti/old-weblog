<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It's fascinating to see people's attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.</p>

<p>What these tools don't easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. But that's a large part of the problem - the endless fascination gets in the way of applying fingers to the keyboard and creating something brand new.</p>

<p>It's easy to get distracted by the sorts of things that are meant to help you out. It's hard to be analytical and dispassionate about your past work while at the same time you're trying to create new work. Not everything worth writing has to rank highly on a search engine or get lots of referral traffic; sometimes, you just need to create something even if it's only for you to stretch your fingers. </p>

<p>I've been using a todo system <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">based on Github issues</a> for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be.</p>

<p>When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided that the only way to make progress on this list was to dramatically prune it. That means taking some items off the list that I really do want to do eventually, it's just that I'm not focusing on them now because every time I look at them on the list I say "no". Crossing them off the list doesn't completely delete them, and when I need to revisit them I can reopen the issue.</p>

<p>The list is down to 30 now, and I'm careful not to add more than that without crossing something else off the list. It still has a few lingering things that haven't been done for a long time, but I have had my teeth cleaned, and what's more I can read through the whole thing in one sitting and usually say "yes" to some next task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grimshaw’s vivid fliers and posters for the legendary Grande Ballroom in the late 1960s featured artists such as the MC5, Cream, the Yardbirds and Paul Butterfield. His style went beyond psychedelic, and is instantly recognizable to rock poster fans, and highly collectible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grimshaw was best friends in childhood with the late MC5 singer Rob Tyner. He was also a part of revolutionary poet John Sinclair’s Rainbow People’s Party and the “Trans-Love Energies” artistic movement. Grimshaw was active from the late 60s until recently, doing new work for local appearances by The White Stripes and Patti Smith and publishing a book last summer with Leni Sinclair titled Detroit Rocks! A Pictorial History of Motor City Rock and Roll 1965 to 1975.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In December 2011 the Ann Arbor District Public Library celebrated the 40th Anniversary of the Free John Now! Concert featuring John Lennon, in great style. The poster for the original concert is one of Gary’s most popular images. For the Ann Arbor events Gary drew a commemorative poster by hand. A group of Gary’s friends from the time organized a Hill Street House Reunion gathering and Gary was able to reconnect with many friends. The newspaper The Ann Arbor Sun is electronically available at <a href="http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org">freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org</a> thanks to the Library’s great effort. </p>

<p>For the rice: prepare 1.5 cups rice according to your taste. Do this first.</p>

<p>For the broccoli: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut a few heads of broccoli into bite sized florets. Mix in a bowl with olive oil, then place on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle sea salt on top. Roast 12-15 minutes until the broccoli is every so slightly browned on top.</p>

<p>For the garbanzos: Drain and rinse a can of garbanzos. Put in a small pot and cover with water. Heat until hot, then rinse again under cool water.</p>

<p>For the red peppers: Cut a red pepper into pieces about the size of a garbanzo bean.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Make a lemon vinaigrette with a little mint.</p>

<p>For the dressing: Some sweet chili paste, or gochujang, or your favorite spicy sauce.</p>

<p>For the feta: crumble some feta.</p>

<p>Serve in individual bowls on the table, for people to mix their own salads. If your family is like mine, someone will eat just rice and peppers and beans, someone else will prefer the salad without feta, someone will want a vinaigrette and someone else (me) will douse the whole thing with chili sauce. Enjoy!</p>

<p>A chemical spill of crude MCHM into the Elk River near Charleston, WV on January 9, 2014 has contaminated the tap water for 300,000 customers of <a href="http://www.amwater.com/wvaw/">West Virginia American Water</a>. The chemical was stored in tanks owned by Freedom Industries. Crude MCHM (<a href="http://www.wvgazette.com/mediafiles/document/2014/01/11/Eastman-MCHM-SDS_I140111162532.PDF">MSDS, Eastman Chemical</a>) is a mixture of several chemicals, including 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol, 4-
(methoxymethyl)cyclohexanemethanol, methyl 4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate, dimethyl 1,4-
cyclohexanedicarboxylate, methanol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; it is used in the coal processing industry to produce "clean coal" that has impurities removed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dorsey has said DEP officials began an investigation after receiving odor complaints from nearby residents starting at about 8:15 a.m. The DEP and Kanawha County emergency officials traced the odors to Freedom Industries, which had not self-reported any sort of leak or accident, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>In an air-quality enforcement order, the DEP said air-quality officials who arrived at the site at 11:10 a.m. "discovered that no spill containment measures had been initiated and that an accumulating MCHM leak pool was seeping thru a dike wall adjacent to the Elk River and a downstream oil sheen was observed."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- As hundreds of thousands of residents in and around the Kanawha Valley struggle with the "do not use" order from West Virginia American Water Co., one stubborn fact continues to frustrate residents and some local health officials alike: No one seems to be able to say for sure what the coal-cleaning chemical that's been dumped into our water supply might do to us.</p>
  
  <p>Water company officials have identified the chemical -- which leaked from a Freedom Industries tank just upstream from the regional drinking-water intake on the Elk River -- as something called "Crude MCHM." That material is made up almost entirely of another chemical, 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol.</p>
  
  <p>Material-safety sheets from several manufacturers list little in the way of health information. Toxicological databases provide few answers.</p>

<p>The world of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/12/lansing-michigan-lbwl-crowdsourced-power-outage-map-of-29-december-2013.html">BWL</a>, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult.</p>

<p>If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. Here too there's no one centralized resource to make that happen. What there is, however, is a very efficient system developed by a world where making that power go back on is important - the nation's utility lineman.</p>

<p>There is a company, <a href="http://linemanbarn.com/">Lineman Barn</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lineman.barn">Facebook page</a> that tracks all kinds of storm-related damage and helps people who do that work connect to each other and find work. (Lineman Barn sells logo clothing for the trade.) When a storm hits, you'll see periodic updates every 6 to 24 hours of utilities that have lines down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Established in 2003 to bring pride and recognition to the trade, Lineman Barn is the First Choice of Linemen and their families for custom shirts, hats, decals, gifts, JOBS and Lineman Safety News.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So without further ado here are the outage numbers from January 6, 2014, at noon. Note that many of these utilities have maps that you can see on the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> page. 
By my count that's 150,192 lines out nationwide.</p>

<p>It's bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. </p>

<p>One of the things we're looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the <strong>emerald ash borer</strong> that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the <a href="http://thegazette.com/2014/01/07/ash-borer-larvae-in-iowa-will-survive-cold-snap-scientists-say/#sthash.ZsDtIacT.dpuf">The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa)</a> has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Minnesota, where arctic outbreaks are colder, more frequent and last longer, they do inhibit the spread of the emerald ash borer, according to Lee Frelich, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology.</p>
  
  <p>In parts of northern Minnesota and North Dakota, frequent, protracted cold spells may actually establish a zone in which ash trees can survive, Frelich said....</p>
  
  <p>Citing recent research conducted in Minnesota, Frelich said 5 percent of emerald ash borer larvae die when exposed to a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The mortality rate increased to 34 percent at 10 below, to 79 percent at 20 below and 98 percent at 30 below, according to that research.</p>
  
  <p>However, the exposure must last at least several hours to overcome the insulating effect of the bark beneath which the larvae live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More details on <a href="http://blogs.mprnews.org/updraft/2014/01/extreme-cold-may-wipe-out-high-percentage-emerald-ash-borer-larvae/">Minnesota Public Radio News</a>, again from Frelich:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the forecast temperatures that we will experience in the next several days will cause a lot of mortality for emerald ash borer in MN. Details below–probably more than you need. I looked up the most recent research this morning, because I figured I will get a lot of questions about this over the next week.</p>
  
  <p>Winter mortality for emerald ash borer is definitely temperature dependent. The larvae can supercool to a certain point, but they die if they freeze, and there is variability in tolerance among individual insects. A recent study from the Forest Service (Venette and Abrahamson–see attached) in Minnesota showed that 5% of the insects die at 0F, 34% at -10F, 79% at -20F and 98% at -30F.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The recent study is <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5191794.pdf">Venette and Abrahamson, Cold Hardiness Of Emerald Ash Borer, AGRILUS PLANIPENNIS: A new perspective</a>. The abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study was designed to assess the cold hardiness of emerald ash borer larvae, the 
  overwintering stage of the insect. We began by measuring larval supercooling points, the 
  temperatures at which larvae freeze. We found that larvae collected from naturally infested trees in St. Paul, MN between late October and early December had an average supercooling point of -25°C (-13°F). Research elsewhere indicates that when these insects freeze, they die. Our laboratory assessments of cold hardiness were confirmed during field tests. Naturally infested logs were held outdoors in St. Paul, MN (low winter air temp=-28°C) and near Grand Rapids, MN (-34°C) for ca. 5.5 weeks. Approximately 40% of larvae from logs in St. Paul were inactive or brown, both evidence of death; approximately 90% of larvae from logs near Grand Rapids were inactive or brown, compared with the approximately 10% that showed evidence of death prior to exposure or after being held under cool, non-lethal conditions. Overwintering mortality 
  may help to minimize the damage caused by emerald ash borer in areas with extremely cold 
  winter climates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you go; the colder the weather, the more of the bugs die.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours).</p>

<p>I put the raw potato strips into a big bowl, pour some olive oil on them, and mix until everything is nicely coated, then put them onto cookie sheets and cook for what seems like a long time in a 425 degree F oven. If you want equally crispy on both sides, turn them over part way through. They would be good with a sprinking of sea salt.</p>

<p>Some more recipes, not that you need much of a recipe.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today.html">yesterbox</a>. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done.</p>

<p>The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. Alas, things go onto this list and stay there forever. How to reconcile the two?</p>

<p>What I'm going to try, as best I can, is to deal with today's bright ideas about what I need to do but don't have time to do right now tomorrow. There will be a finite number of things to look at, and I can probably deal with some of them right away. I don't mean to kick the can down the road, but I also don't want to try to tackle everything I've ever thought of doing all at once.</p>

<p>Inspired in part by the <a href="http://www.wallofvoodoo.net/">Wall of Voodoo</a> song "Tomorrow".</p>

<p>I'll do it tomorrow / that seems like a pretty good idea to me</p>

<p><br/> </p>

<p>FYI: I discussed this issue with the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Snow_emergency">Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council</a> and options were discussed. County government has been mobilized to do our part to ensure that members of our community that are homeless are able to keep warm over the next few days.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> is working with <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Delonis_Center">Delonis</a> to ensure that we find space for additional individuals. From my understanding, additional capacity was made available today. Another concern that has been raised is that some members of the homeless community are not able to pass a breathalyzer test and so will not be admitted to the Delonis Warming Shelter. Due to the severity of the predicted cold, it appears that Delonis will be more lenient with this policy.  </p>

<p>The County's <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">Project Outreach Team</a> has been delivering sleeping bags, and other warming materials to individuals that are camping outside tonight. Through site visits and other methods, they have established an accounting of individuals that are sleeping outside and their needs. For those that do not have access to warming at the Delonis Center, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a> has offered accommodations to house those individuals and keep them warm.</p>

<p>Public Health is also working with their Emergency Officer to respond to public health concerns as they arise. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Washtenaw_County_Public_Health">Public Health</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/CSTS">Community Support and Treatment Services</a> and The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> have been working around the clock to ensure that folks stay warm tonight. With the cold setting in, we must remain vigilant to ensure that no one falls though the cracks. If anyone hears of any issues of people being turned away from the warming center, please contact me. We will ensure that resources are available to help those that need warmth. </p>

<p>Thank you all for your concern on this matter. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>From email sent by Ann Arbor City Council member <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Christopher_Taylor">Christopher Taylor</a> (D-3d Ward).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>Here is a quick update for you about the snow and the City’s response.</p>

<p>As of 9:00 pm, we have had 11+ inches of snow. We have not declared a formal snow emergency and street parking is unrestricted. </p>

<p>All City facilities will be open Monday and trash collection will run on its ordinary schedule. </p>

<p>Road crews are out working 12 – 14 hour shifts. The day shift had 14 trucks assigned to Major roadways until noon, then dropped down to 12 trucks to accommodate schedule changes necessary to bolster the night shift.  Our night shift began at 6pm with a regular staff of 14 trucks assigned to Majors. The Major road staff will start using sand/salt mix around midnight. Additional staff will be assigned to work on locals during the night.  Local plowing will begin with Monday and Tuesday trash collection routes, and then continue throughout the City.  </p>

<p>The Snow Desk (994-SNOW) will be staffed 7am - 11pm thru Wednesday to answer resident questions and to report concerns.</p>

<p>As ever, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Stay warm and if you must travel, drive carefully.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Christopher Taylor</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is current as of January 4, 2014. Check on the <a href="http://library.municode.com/HTML/11782/level3/TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC.html#TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC_10_143SNEM">Municode</a> web site for the absolute latest information, though it's unlikely that the ordinance will change.</p>

<p>Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a "Snow Condition Yellow". From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheCityOfAnnArbor">City of Ann Arbor Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets. Moving your car will also keep it from being plowed in with snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A snow emergency declared on Dec. 25-26, 2002, but City Council voted in Jan. 6, 2003 to waive or reduce fines from tickets issued during that event; this <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/03/02/monthly-milestone-institutional-memory/">according to the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>

<p>10:143. Snow emergencies.</p>

<p>(1)
Prohibited parking for snow removal.</p>

<p>(a)
Whenever the City Administrator finds, on the basis of snow, sleet, freezing rain, or on the basis of a weather forecast, that weather conditions make it necessary to restrict parking to allow removal of existing or forecasted snow, the Administrator may declare a snow emergency and put in effect an odd/even parking prohibition on some or all city streets by providing notice of the prohibition in the manner prescribed by this section.</p>

<p>(b)
When an odd/even parking prohibition is in effect, no person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle owned by him or her to remain parked on the following described portions of any street; provided, however, that the parking prohibition of this subsection does not apply during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that vehicles can be positioned to comply with the next day's prohibition.</p>

<p>(i)
On days having uneven dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having even street addresses.</p>

<p>(ii)
On days having even dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having uneven street addresses.</p>

<p>(2)
Notice.</p>

<p>(a)
The prohibitions provided in this section shall take effect when the Administrator causes notice of such prohibitions to be publicly announced by radio stations, Community Television Network and any other suitable media outlet with normal operating ranges covering the city. The prohibitions shall then take effect at the time provided in the announcement. The Administrator may also cause notice of the parking prohibition to be published in newspapers of general circulation when feasible.</p>

<p>(b)
The parking prohibitions provided by this section shall remain in effect until the Administrator makes a public announcement of the termination of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>(3)
Nothing contained in this section permits parking at times or places where it is otherwise prohibited by this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 48-01, § 3, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 38-02, § 1, 10-21-02; Ord. No. 2-03, § 1, 2-18-03)</p>

<p>For January 2-3 2014 we are looking at a wind chill advisory for the Ann Arbor area with wind chills going all the way past 15 below F. From the <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=dtx&amp;storyid=99316&amp;source=0">NWS Detroit</a>: </p>

  <p>Cold overnight temperatures in the single digits below zero will combine with 10 to 15 mph winds to cause dangerous Wind Chill Values of -17 to -23 across all of southeast Michigan.  A Wind Chill Advisory has been issued for all of southeast Michigan Tonight through Friday Morning.</p>

<p>On the Ann Arbor Public Schools site, there's a <a href="http://www.a2schools.org/aaps/schools/school_safety">wind chill chart</a> that shows you the combination of wind and cold that sets school policy for indoor recess and for canceling school. Mind you that school doesn't start until Monday January 6 2014.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On days when the temperature and/or wind chill are below 0ºF:</p>

      <p>This simple dish of beans and greens comes from Mary Ann Esposito's <a href="http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2221/broccoli-rabe-with-white-beans">Ciao Italia</a>. It's similar in many ways to the traditional "Hoppin' John" served for good luck for the new year.</p>

<h2>Hoppin' Giovanni</h2>

<p>Wash and chop a bunch of rapini (broccoli rabe). If you can't find rapini, some other mild green like turnip greens (or even kale) would work nicely.</p>

<p>Mince a shallot fine and saute in a large pan in olive oil until fragrant. Add a few generous pinches of red pepper flakes. Put the chopped rapini into the pan and cook until the greens are cooked through.</p>

<p>Drain and rinse a can of white beans (cannellini). When the greens are cooked through, add the beans and stir. You can add a little more olive oil to the pan at this point if you want to. Stir and then bring back up to heat.</p>

<p>Serve hot. This would go good with pasta.</p>

      <p>I'm thinning out my todo list for the new year to delete some of the oldest items, the ones that aren't particularly hard but they also haven't been done this past year.</p>

<p>I figure that if I need to do them, the opportunity will arise again, and it might be easier to get them done if they show up fresh at the top of the list rather than buried at the bottom.</p>

<p>What's humorous (or sad) is the items marked "urgent" that are more than a week old; clearly, simply marking something as urgent does not stand in for actually doing the work.</p>

<p>Ah, new year's productivity !</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yup, thinning out the list is now a perpetual activity; I'm trying to keep work in progress under about 30 tasks. There may be more to do in the world, you think? I can only keep track of so much of it.</p>

      <p>Kai Petainen writes that the downtown "Library Lot" parking structure so full on New Years Eve that when everyone went to leave it at once, the lines were so long that people's paid tickets ran out of time. This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay.</p>

<p>I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events.

      </h3>
      <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy
of something I've already written and published somewhere else.
That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by
googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into
the ether too quickly (including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ourfounder/posts/10152097845036826">this thread</a> which will die quietly
when we are all done with it).</p>

<p>Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really
provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic
discussion. Rather, they bias towards the moderator's interests,
because only the posts from the moderator are visible for long
enough to get any traffic.</p>

<p>The problem of how to build forum software is old and solved. The
MTS Confer system and others that followed it like Picospan and <a href="http://www.caucus.com">Caucus</a>
lived in a world where you could create a long-running discussion
that focused on one topic and where you could keep that topic mostly
on-topic over an extended period of time. Facebook, in contrast, 
feels more like a big chat room, where yesterday's posts scroll off
into nothingness and where you can't get back to any discussion you
once had - no matter how good it was.</p>

<p>Twitter doesn't give you the paragraph-sized chunks of discussion that
you need to actually have an intelligent conversation, but it does 
have long-lived hashtags that enable a community of interest to form
and (with scheduled chats) thrive. It's possible to find people who
you don't know who share an interest and to communicate with them in
such a way that a simple enough search brings back something useful.
Nothing on Facebook behaves that way.</p>

unusual in this day and age.</p>

<p>The map below is a crowd-sourced tracking of outages and
restorations in the Lansing area. It's been put together
under the lead of @<a href="http://twitter.com/jsiarto">jsiarto</a> (Jeff Siarto) with the help of
other Lansing area residents and with data pulled in part from
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LansingBWL">LBWL Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lbwl.com/">Lansing Board of Water and Light</a> is a municipally owned public utility,
governed by a Board of Commissioners. The board is made up of eight
Lansing residents, each appointed for a four-year term on the board
by the Mayor and confirmed by City Council.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike Consumers Energy and DTE, Lansing Board of Water and Light doesn't have a real time outage map for customers, but it's something the company is currently developing, according to company spokesperson Steve Serkaian.</p>
  
  <p>"We're working on a "smart grid" system that's similar to what other utilities offer, but it's something that costs a significant amount of money to implement," he said. "But we have heard our customers loud and clear and we're committed to working on communicating with them better."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(BWL General Manager J. Peter Lark) said BWL is running at “optimum” staffing levels. On Friday, he said, 30 crews were on the ground, a figure that includes 12 line crews and five tree-trimming crews. Crews are made up of two or three people, with most line crews using three.
  The utility to date has brought in outside help from five other municipally owned utilities, but Lark said Friday he doesn’t plan to bring in more — at least one BWL employee would have to ride with the outside crew, and that would reduce the number of BWL crews in operation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of those still without power are customers of Lansing’s public utility. Angry customers showed up at a company press conference yesterday to complain about the slow repairs. The number of Lansing Board of Water and Light customers without power actually increased yesterday as melting ice from tree limbs damaged more power lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The press conference confirmed communication failures on the part of the officials involved. But when will that get better? Why not now? When will the outages be over? When will the community return to normal? When will the powers-that-be get their act together so people can make wise choices? Temperatures are expected to plunge into single digits tonight. What should people whose power is out do now? Move their families, especially the elderly and infirm, to other locations? Can people with pets still take them to the Ingham County Animal Shelter? When will those who should have the answers start communicating effectively?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This delicious lentil, feta, and olive pasta salad is adapted from the cookbook <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/best-125-meatless-pasta-dishes/oclc/24375167">The Best 125 Meatless Pasta Dishes</a> by <a href="http://mindycooks.blogspot.com/">Mindy Toomay</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/author/geiskopfhadlersusann">Susann Geiskopf-Hadler</a>, published by <a href="http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/article/setting-the-pace-prima-publishing-12266/1">Prima Publishing</a> in 1992.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of water to 1.5 cups of lentils in a saucepan on the stove. Add 2 bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then cook 25-35 minutes until the lentils are done. Rinse under cold water and drain. Note: you'll want lentils that hold their shape in cooking; look for French lentils or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/855532">lentils du Puy</a> in the bulk section of your favorite grocer.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, chop vegetables. Note that all vegetables are to be chopped small, so that they are not that much bigger than the lentils. For the vegetables:</p>

<ul>
<li>one bell pepper, green or red</li>
<li>1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted of course</li>
</ul>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, wash a bunch of parsley, and run it through the food processor until it is chopped very fine.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, make a salad dressing, which is a nice garlicky vinaigrette.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
<li>2 medium cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced fine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Near the end of the lentil cooking time, put on pasta to cook. </p>

<p>Just before serving, dice or crumble some feta and put it into a separate bowl, in the case that you have dinner guests who don't care for feta.</p>

<p>Get a large bowl, and mix the lentils, vegetables, parsley, and dressing together in it.</p>

<p>Very delicious. Serve at room temperature.</p>

<p>Prep time - 45 to 60 minutes.</p>

      <p>MuckRock's George Levine did an interview with me for MuckRock News. Here's the start:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this week’s Requester’s Voice MuckRock goes hyperlocal with Ann Arbor’s Edward Vielmetti. From parking garages to sidewalks, Vielmetti is plugged in to the home of the Wolverines. He shows us how working with public documents should extend beyond federal fiddlings and can really have an impact on a local community. Formerly of AnnArbor.com, Vielmetti currently writes a weekly FOIA post for Damn Arbor. He is also working on a FOIA book The No-Nonsense Guide to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act.</p>
