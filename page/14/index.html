<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-27-the-internet-of-power-outages/">The internet of power outages</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The single most popular page on this web site is the power outage tracking map collection page. It has static copies of samples of power outage maps from utilities around the country, and it gets bunches of hits every single time there's bad weather - to the extent that I can pretty much tell where there's bad weather by the outbound clicks on the page.</p>

<p>The page, however, is not fed with live data; it only has static instances of previous maps. It in and of itself doesn't alert when there's trouble, and it doesn't let you know that the storm coming your way might be severe.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of automation in the utility outage map space is the diversity of vendors for power company outage maps and the utter lack of any standard interface. To dig out how many people have lost their power in 48104 under program control, you actually have to work at it, and to rely on undocumented interfaces that could change at any time. For all of the user-friendly efforts out there, there's a lot of systems that are hard to pull raw data from.</p>

<p>I've started a very tiny version of what I suspect could be a complete project, namely to automate the alerting when a few zip codes around me have outages. The code, written in Node-RED, runs periodically to poll the DTE Energy outage map site and to ask for outage data for a few specific zip codes. It then parses that data in a Javascript/node.js node which returns it to a switch that decides whether to alert (in my case, when there are more than 250 outages in any given monitored zipcode). Alerts go out via Twitter on the @vielmetti account and via SMS to me.</p>

<p>The monitoring task for the adjacent utility company, Consumers Energy, is a bit different. I haven't completed this effort yet, but again a poll of their site will pull a report which in this case has a list of counties and an outage count in each county. There's a few counties that I'm monitoring, and I'll figure out the threshold for alerts there.</p>

<p>Node-RED is a nice programming environment for this, since it's flexible in many ways about how data gets into it and how and when alerts are done. I'm still sorting through the new "trigger" alert node in 0.8.0 which makes it possible to buffer up things so you don't get an overflow of messages all at once, and there's some subtle alarm-management logic that I want to get right so that this system can be used for real alerting and not just curiosity.</p>

<p>When Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast, there was a long delay between the time that power went out and when it was restored, and there was some innovation in outage tracking and holding public utilities accountable for restoration performance. Similarly, when a storm hit the East Lansing, MI area there were furious municipal power consumers outraged that their utility company didn't have an accurate tracking map.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that this starts to look like an architecture for outage tracking that can be refined over time, and I'd be super happy if utility companies started to post outage information in any reasonable easy to parse JSON or XML format files (really, it just has to be published, standards can occur as we get experience). I'll poll regularly enough to get some kind of timeline as to when the lights went out and how long it took for them to return.</p>

<p>I have found myself thinking about things, and how to connect things to the net, quite a bit recently. I'll be blogging more about it here and elsewhere.</p>

<p>By "things" I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can't connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do. In the middle of this network there are message routing systems, and at the human edge there are various points where people need to make decisions about what should happen next.</p>

<p>Things are fascinating in many places that the web is not. Treating web site visitors like so many pinballs through a funnel dehumanizes them, but that's a lot of what makes people focus on user behavior. </p>

<p>I've been building things out of smaller things, learning how to plumb them together, understanding message flows and designing out behaviors. It's transformative in the way that making web pages never will be transformative.  The task now is to write some of this stuff up, the late night experiments and the discovery of new hardware and the task of plugging things together and making them work. </p>

      <p>I wrote about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/all-hands-active-downtown-ann-arbor-hacker-space.html">All Hands Active</a> briefly in 2010 when they opened. It's a hacker space in a basement on E Liberty St in downtown Ann Arbor (at Maynard Street), where Dawn Treader was once upon a time and later Digital Ops.</p>

<p>I decided a few weeks ago to become a member, so that I'd have a workshop that was well stocked with equipment and so that I could start working on projects in a place that not only had cool stuff but also that had smart people and was convenient to downtown.</p>

<p>What's the project for summer 2014? Certainly a piece of it is getting a new Raspberry Pi hooked up and running and getting some blinking lights attached to it. The next order of business past that is unclear. I'm interested in short-haul digital radios for remote monitoring and control systems, and there are some Arduino based kits (the <a href="http://moderndevice.com/product/jeenode-smd/">Jeenode</a>, for instance) that look like they would be useful for radio-based efforts. </p>

<p>At some point I'll want to learn how to solder, if only because there's some things you can only build when you know how to do more than plug cables together!</p>

      <p>Here's a thought experiment for 2014.</p>

<p>What do you do with the Internet of Cats? You have a cat with a collar, and some number of grams of electronics that can be affixed to the collar. What kind of interesting internet stuff can go there?</p>

<p>So far I've found the <a href="https://www.sticknfind.com">StickNFind</a>, which is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon with a key fob attachment and some pictures of cats wearing it as a tag. It's about the size of a quarter, which looks like a reasonable size, but all of the applications for it that I've seen so far at retail are local area network direct attachments and not wide area network systems.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was productive this morning, cranking out about 1500 words in the span of a couple of hours without much in the way of distractions. It was a timely day to be productive, and the morning's activity resulted in a further productive afternoon meeting. It was a good day. (Not every day is always a good day for writing.)</p>

<p>How do I get away from distractions? The key was to find an unusual place in this world: a location with good enough coffee, enough power outlets, broken wifi and no cell service. (It was the Scio Township Panera, if you're wondering.) The lack of T-Mobile service, and the downtime on the Panera wifi, meant that I could easily ignore the dozens of email messages that I might answer and the infinite stream of things to read online and instead open up a terminal window, open up vim, and start typing until the screen filled up and then some.</p>

<p>The problem with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/the-problem-with-unreliablenetworks-is-that-you-have-to-engineer-extra-hard-to-be-able-to-make-use-of-them-and-you-still-ca.html">unreliable networks</a> is that you have to work extra hard to get any value out of them, enough to distract you entirely from their use. When the Internet is completely down, though, it's much easier. I have good enough writing tools to create prose without an Internet necessary for looking things up, and the notes I was working from were all on paper. Any research I needed to do during the course of the writing got marked with an XXX, and when the Panera wifi came back online, I was able to fill in a few gaps.</p>

<p>It takes either a little bit of good luck or a great deal of self discipline to go off the net. Modern computing systems assume that always-on is the normal case, and that offline behavior is anomalous. Indeed there are systems like the Chromebook that are completely crippled without a network there to make them happy, but no one I know sells a laptop that doesn't have wifi built in.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Did you ever wake up from a long session online and discover that you had very little to show for it? </p>

<p>There's a pattern of internet use that's simple and very disturbingly unproductive. Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn't produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you've visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there's something new.</p>

<p>It's a wonderful way to consume content, and since you're always looking at new things it's a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty. Subscribe to enough people, join enough networks, and you could fill your hours with new things indefinitely.</p>

<p>What this doesn't provide you with is a chance to create your own thing. Sure, you can share, retweet, bookmark, comment, or favorite, but that's not the same as picking an idea that's fresh and spending a few minutes from scratch presenting something new - not just new to you, but new to the world.</p>

<p>Creating something from nothing is much more difficult work than reading or looking what what other people have done. It takes time, and more importantly it forces you to risk making something that other people will judge. I heartily recommend getting off the social network refresh treadmill from time to time and writing something longer, even if it's not perfect.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here's a latest try.</p>

<p>There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban:
1. Visualize your work
2. Limit your work-in-progress</p>

<p>I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/personal-kanban-from-jim-benson-and-modus-cooperandi.html">wrote about Personal Kanban before</a> back in 2010, but I didn't try to put it into practice as such.</p>

<p>Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There's a <a href="http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/boardthing/">review of Boardthing</a> from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it's a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board. The little rectangles each have some text or an image in them, and they can be nested so you can move them around in groups. There's really not much more than that, and it runs in a browser.</p>

<p>This infrastructure is enough to create a Personal Kanban board. Create little rectangles at minimum for "Things to do", "Doing", and "Done", and type into the little rectangles to move them around until you figure out what to do, stop typing, and get something done. I recommend a "Things not to do" rectangle as an added productivity boost.</p>

<p>How does this work in the long term? The system is pretty light weight, and it saves your state between sessions. I suppose if your page gets too cluttered you can start a new one that is more focused. Having a smallish screen forces you to limit your work in progress, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave Gray and Jim Benson have a set of approaches that should work well together, this is mostly written for the both of them as an introduction of sorts.</p>

      <p>The latest update for Arborwiki is that the database is now hosted on the Localwiki central platform. This gives us updated maps, current software, and additional central hosting support. The cut over was on May 1, 2014.</p>

<p>All of the old Arborwiki URLs still work; you can get to the home page at <a href="http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor">http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor</a> or at <a href="http://arborwiki.org">http://arborwiki.org</a> . We fixed a temporary problem where old URLs with a /city/ prefix stopped working.</p>

<p>One of the things that is clear from the effort is that there's a lot of Ypsilanti content originally hosted at YpsiWiki that could, with the right people, be easily hived off into its own project also under the Localwiki umbrella but with its own home page and look.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one was killed or injured when more than a dozen CSX tanker cars derailed on Wednesday afternoon, but the resulting fire and spill prompted City Manager Kimball Payne to declare an emergency and temporarily evacuate part of downtown.</p>
  
  <p>The spill also prompted Richmond utility officials to prepare to possibly switch to an alternative source for the city’s drinking water supply, which depends primarily on the James.

      </h3>
      <p>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the "Paid for by" language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.</p>

<p>I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook. I also looked generally at Google, searching for the phrase in question. The four candidates for the Democratic side of the Ann Arbor mayoral ballot are Stephen Kunselman, Sally Hart Petersen, Sabra Briere and Christopher Taylor.</p>

<p>Stephen Kunselman: while I can find a "Kunselman for Council" web site, I can't locate a "Kunselman for Mayor" web site. The candidate's Facebook page doesn't mention the candidacy that I can see. I haven't seen any ads from the candidate yet. </p>

<p>Sally Hart Petersen: No search results on Google for the mayoral campaign. A Facebook page for the candidate has 294 likes; in the header, it says "Paid for by the Committee to Elect Sally Hart Petersen to Mayor", but that header omits the expected address of the committee. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>Sabra Briere: A search for "Paid for by Sabra Briere for Mayor" generates two pages. The http://sabrabriereformayor.org/ web page has "Paid for by Sabra Briere for City Council" at the bottom, in white type on a yellow background making it virtually unreadable; it also has bunches of Latin text where the real text should be, making me suspicious that it's not real. On Facebook, the page "Vote for Sabra for Ann Arbor Mayor in the Democratic Primary on Tuesday August 5th 2014" has invited 500 people, but has no "Paid for by" disclosure. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Sabra Briere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, sabrabriereformayor.org is a non-working website.  A completely different set of pages should be up soon - but in the meantime, I changed the accent yellow to an accent blue - so the white lettering is now higher contrast.</p>
  
  <p>It isn't at all ready to be published, and is just there as filler for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Taylor: A search for "Paid for by Christopher Taylor for Mayor" has 49 results, from the candidate's own web site and from "ngpvanhost". (<a href="http://www.ngpvan.com/">NGP VAN</a> is a campaign website hosting platform for Democrats.) The "Christopher Taylor for Ann Arbor" Facebook page has 686 likes, with no "Paid for by" until you get to the "Contribute" page. Facebook ads for Taylor say "Sponsored", but do not disclose who is paying for them in either the text of the ad or in the image associated with the ad.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Christopher Taylor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that we included the proper disclosure language in the initial ad, but that for some reason it is not appearing. We're on it and will fix it pronto.</p>
  
  <p>I appreciate the notification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are any of these clearcut campaign violations? Probably not. The relevant text of the law is "Any other medium used for campaign purposes shall clearly and unequivocally include the identification or disclaimer, or both, provided in section 47 of the act." Michigan campaign finance law has not been updated to provide specific rules for Facebook (or Twitter), so you can't point to a specific line of text that says "you did this wrong". Without specific guidance, there's wiggle room, and a wait for an opinion from the Attorney General.</p>

<p>Is this "flyspecking", as one candidate described my efforts, or mere "piffle" as another political operative chided me? It's still early in the race, but expectations are that this will be one of the most expensive political races in Ann Arbor mayoral history, with four primary campaigns going and an empty mayoral seat at stake. I fully expect my Facebook timeline and Google search results to be full of paid advertising, and that that advertising will get more and more political as the primary draws near. Close attention to who is paying how much for what is worthwhile, especially in the presence of "free media" like Facebook where you can sent out an unrelenting stream of updates and invites at no obvious direct cost to anyone except the poor reader who just wants to see funny cat videos.</p>

      <p>In my case, that means in part going through my inbox with a sharp eye and saying "can I unsubscribe from this?" I was astounded to figure out just how many times I was able to say "yes" to that question. The hope is that the inbox gets a little bit less cluttered.</p>

<p>I'm sure some marketing department got a little bit sad. Every unsubscribe routine is a little bit different, but the usual drill ends with a plaintive "we're sorry to see you go, did we do something wrong to offend you?" Either you ignore that screen, or you click the politest thing that makes sense to click. Sometimes there's a super-sad follow up automated email, "you're off the list now, did you make a mistake?"</p>

<p>No mistake. I don't need your weekly advertising specials, your cheap flights to places I'm not going to, your chirpy newsletter full of details of events I'm not going to. Trust me, if I need you, I can type your URL into a browser. What I don't need is a daily / weekly reminder that I'm not interested right now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This eulogy was read for my great-uncle Alfio (Auch) by his nephew Zorba. Alfio Vielmetti died in 2008 at the age of 96. I think of him when I am out on my walks, and I miss him when I wish I had someone like him to talk to about city council.</p>

<p>AUCH</p>

<p>My uncle Alfio lived a life centered on family and community, with lessons learned hard in early years, and applied for a very long lifetime. Many of these lessons came from his father, Max, and Max didn't discuss, he announced the lessons - and in some cased, how they were going to be learned. One of the earliest and strongest was sharing, and with seven siblings, there was plenty of constant reinforcement.</p>

<p>Brothers worked to help one another –to be there when needed- after all, Auch had an older brother named Rock. They all worked as kids, then as students at Ann Arbor- always working. Always remembering the hard times- that when they were kids, their shoes were stored once the weather turned warm- and they stayed there until the fall. Working for the iceman- that was tough work for a kid, but it helped make for a pretty tough kid.</p>

<p>Auch had a real love of working with his hands- building things, fixing things- his own, but also for others. He’d show up with the right tools to get a project going – or finished. He was generous with his time and talents- right down to answering a lot of questions from hyper-inquisitive nephews who wanted to build things too. He built a cottage at Spread Eagle pretty much from the dirt up, and helped Howard and Mitch keep their places going across the lake.</p>

<p>He was always providing for the family- building things, fixing things, making things better.</p>

<p>There was great pain in his earlier years, with the death of his wife Marge during the birth of his son David, but he found a new partner in Lois and with her support rebuilt the Vielmetti family home over 7 years down to the smallest detail –building the '''components''' of the smallest details., while building a business and partnering with his brother on various ventures.</p>

<p>Auch was a lifelong supporter of this church, not just going to mass every day and helping out financially, but working with Father Mark on the history of the parish and helping to identify folks in pictures and stories. He had a prodigious memory in regard to the people and history of Norway.</p>

<p>One of Auch’s fathers great commitments in life was to education- and as usual, Max walked the walk, sending every one of his children to the university of Michigan. Auch took it to heart as well, checking in on the next generation- verifying mid-story to see if they indeed knew the meaning of some of his terms and references, as well as founding standing scholarships at the Norway-Vulcan High School.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was at the hospital visiting Auch while he was recovering from cancer surgery, and before he unloaded on the doctors and staff about what they did right- the surgery; and what they did wrong, everything else; and how he was going home that day, regardless of what they thought, that he had his nephew and Jack Osborne there to spring him- well before all that, we talked about charity. No- that’s not quite right- I mostly listened. I listened as he told me of the importance of having charity in your life- in a very broad sense –in that we are all in this together, and that you owed something as your share- your contribution to your family, your friends, your town, and your country.</p>

<p>He pitched in on every level- from installing a new pump at our cottage, to establishing scholarships at the high school, to spending years following Patton across Europe during the war. He spoke of the easier kinds of charity- where you could send a check to folks doing good deeds here and there in the community- the world, and the closer in version- the one where you showed up, spent some time and effort to help out. The one where you had to get up, and get out.</p>

<p>In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us. He walked every day to the library to read the WSJ, he walked to the stores and the bowling alley, and also, You see, on a lot of his walks, he went to sundry houses and visited the sick and the infirm- just a stop in to see how they were doing- and to cheer them up he said. Now if he was on tear about the city council, I’m not certain how cheery it was, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The walking tours made for better health through exercise - as well as better health through helping others.</p>

<p>Auch was a good man who has left a rich legacy by example, and a lot of us are going to miss him.</p>

<p>I used to belong to the Vacuum Cleaners Collector Club a few years back.  I live in Ann Arbor on the west side, and am interested in selling off my Vacuum collection.  I am hoping you may know of some people who may be interested, since I am no longer in the club. </p>

<p>I have about 60 vacuums, dating back to the “coffee can Hoovers.”  I donated a couple to the Hoover Museum when I went to the Hoover 100th anniversary a few years back.  I have mostly Hoovers (60, 61, 62, etc), and an Electrolux G that is in practically showroom condition with all of the attachments including the power head and turbo floor scrubber.  I also have a 1205 that works well.  I’ve got a Rainbow (around 1993) and some older Kirbys (D-50, D-80, Classic III 2C and Legend).  I also have some newer Miele’s that work very well. </p>

<p>The main reason for me selling is that I need the space in the basement, and need some $$ for home repair.  </p>

<p>It's a fairly new (2012) dam.

      </h3>
      <p>I've unsubscribed from a local politics mailing list that I've been on for a while. Out of an abundance of not wanting to name names, I'm not naming names; chances are there's one of these in your community too.</p>

<p>The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There's a list owner, who sets the rules. One of the rules is that the list is a private list, with no reporters on it and no one is supposed to share anything they get from the list to anyone who's not on the list. Occasionally someone transgresses and they get visibly kicked off the list. A number of small-time politicians are on the mailing list, and it's run by a former elected official.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how I ever got on the list, but I stayed on it. I didn't feel like I could contribute anything to it, because if I was outed as a blogger I'm sure I'd be kicked off. And I couldn't copy anything from it to anyone else (even though I did from time to time). </p>

<p>Small town politics can be very small and very bitter. The straw that broke the camel's back was whining that there wasn't enough parking near Farmer's Market downtown, since apparently walking 5 minutes to an enormous structure nearby wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Not my clowns, not my circus. My inbox is full enough as is. If I need to read this particular list, I'll just FOIA the contents of the inboxes of the elected officials that subscribe to it.</p>

      <p>Getting things done includes deciding what not to do. In my case, it's a matter of going through my todo list and striking off the well-intentioned tasks from two or three months ago that took a moment to write and that would take hours to complete.</p>

<p>I'm better off at accomplishing things when there are fewer undone things to choose from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you do anything you consider useful, however small a win it may be, write it down on your done list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can lead to the purposeful behavior of writing something on your todo list just to cross it off and mark it done. The system I'm using doesn't easily distinguish between the three states of "did and then wrote it down", "wrote it down and did it later", or "wrote it down and decided not to do it later". But that's a quibble.</p>

  <p>To reach the huge non-crypto masses requires something they can identify with.  Dogecoin did it.  Kinda.  In a weird, fleeting way.  Doge is just a glimpse of what's possible.  But memes have a VERY limited lifespan.  Doge may grow beyond the meme.  I don't know.  But with Juggalos, it's not about a meme.  It's about a community.  A community that already exists, and has been around for over 20 years!  </p>
  
  <p>This is the innovation that JuggaloCoin offers:  A coin that appeals to a very specific, very tight community.  A community of over 1 million people.  We are offering a real opportunity for crypto to dramatically increase its reach.</p>

<p>Why? If you've read newspaper comments, you'll know why already: they are awful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world of Internet commenting offers a marvelous opportunity for discussion and the exchange of ideas. But as anyone who has ever ventured into a comment thread can attest, these forums too often turn into a morass of negativity, racism, hate speech and general trollish behaviors that detract from the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes time, effort, energy, and love to engage with readers enough to make the stream of their comments to be anywhere near as worthwhile to read as the professionally produced stories that sit at the top of the page. Too often the news organization treats comments as an afterthought, or if they do think about it they are woefully unprepared to handle the burden.</p>

<p>It hasn't always been the case, of course. Once upon a time (he says, shaking his cane) the letter to the editor was carefully edited, double checked for identity, and only run with some consideration. For the most part, newspapers have given up on their opportunity to corral the best of public discussion into their own pages, leaving it instead for the idiots on parade.</p>

  <p>As frank as FARK comments can be, the worst seen here excel far beyond the idiocy seen on newspapers. At least Farkers have brains</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook is changing; in this particualr case it's a reorganization of the messaging functions into their own app. From <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/facebook-messenger-or-the-highway/">Techcrunch</a>, the predictable cries of frustration from people who are used to what they have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still, a unilateral forced migration is the exact kind of change Facebook users hate, and this will only breed more paranoia that their social network could change without their consent. Taking a slower “We’re switching everyone eventually, so you might as well do it now” approach might have gone over better than “Your familiar chat interface will be destroyed in two weeks whether you like it or not”.</p>

<p>We don't like it when our telescreen is changed.</p>

<p>The telescreen is from George Orwell's 1984. An <a href="http://www.theorwellreader.com/excerpt.shtml">excerpt</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plate commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You have to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. </p>
