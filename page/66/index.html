<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>In the &quot;this might be too weird for this year's Halloween costume&quot; department:</p>

<p><p>from<a href="http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/no_one_meaner/"> Live Design Online, &quot;No One Meaner than a Vacuum Cleaner&quot;</a></p><blockquote><p>The opera (Evil Machines) features wild cars and other evil machines, pitted against
friendly household appliances, including a beautiful egg whisk and the
alarm clock that loves her. Veteran costume designer and Monty Python
movie alum James Acheson had a hand in designing the opening chorus of
six evil vacuum cleaners. The chorus is joined by a 15&rsquo; giant evil
vacuum cleaner, who — with the help of an inflatable body, a fan, and
some CO2 — literally bursts with pride, showering dust and bed bugs over the orchestra and the first few rows of the audience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7180000/newsid_7184500/7184582.stm">The BBC has a video with a Terry Jones interview and some of the dancing vacuums</a> (sorry, can&rsquo;t embed it).</p><blockquote><p>Opera singers appear as giant appliances in Monty Python creator Terry
Jones&rsquo; new &lsquo;opera&rsquo; Evil Machines which is being premiered in Lisbon,
Portugal.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jan/16/theatre3">The Guardian weighs in (in Jan 2008) </a></p><blockquote><p>Evil Machines, a new opera devised and directed by Monty Python star
Terry Jones, looks set to come to London. Starring singing
tumble-dryers, a giant red telephone and a 15ft-tall vacuum cleaner, it
has just opened in Portugal, to standing ovations.</p></blockquote><p>Too weird for words, but topical and seasonally appropriate in the oddest way; see at 2:40 in the video below.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-03-halloween-costu/">Halloween costume: vacuum with attachments</a>
      </h3>
      <p>in some extremely silly world, here are practical ways to get dressed for Halloween as a vacuum cleaner with attachments.<br /><a href="http://www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com/original-halloween-costumes.html"><br />From &quot;coolest homemade costumes dot com&quot; in their home appliances section:</a></p><blockquote><p>My husband started with an empty box, free from the grocery store
and cut it down to fit her. He then wrapped it in some black vinyl,
attached some parts from old vacuums we had in the garage (handle, hose
and attachment, caddy with brushes). The red Hoover emblem was a piece
of red sticky-backed felt. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The feet (power head) were two
pieces of 4&quot; foam hollowed out, one on each foot for movement. We
decorated them with more red felt displaying 12 amps and aluminum foil
for a headlight. While trick or treating so many people asked her to
clean their houses for fun! </p></blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <p><a href="http://dailypress2.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=8231&amp;si=Vacuum">A red upright Hoover costume for a 3 year old</a> (photo at link)<br /><a href="http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/season/feature/costume_contest_dirt/"><br />Disney's Family Fun has this one, submitted by Julie L of Arglye TX:</a></p><blockquote><p>Made with a black sweatsuit and red felt, the vacuum bag portion of
this costume gets its full shape from newspaper stuffing, while foam
core is used to make the sweeper. Toilet paper rolls painted black and
attached to a knit cap create the handle, and a black cord is the final
touch to the wearable appliance.
</p></blockquote><p>Finally, here's a twist I hadn't expected: rather than you dressing as a vacuum, dress your vacuum (in this case the Roomba robot vacuum) in <a href="http://myroombud.com/roombafrogger.html">a Frogger costume from myRoomBud.</a> </p>

The video commentary:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">Ever
since Phillip Torrone
and Limor Fried played
Roomba Frogger down in
Texas, we wanted to play
it too except we could
not afford to use one
of our Roombas &hellip; so
we hacked a Frogger game
to use one our RoomBud
costume characters, Roobit
the Frog. Well that wasn&rsquo;t
good enough so using a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=3&amp;idproduct=1">RooTooth</a>
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/">RoombaDevTools</a>
for the wireless bluetooth
connection to our computer
and a bit more coding,
we put together a game
that we can play on the
computer and have Roobit
the Frog RoomBud actually
run along the floor doing
the same maneuvers as
the Frogger character.
When you get your little
Roobit across the river,
your Roomba will start
to vacuum!</span></p></blockquote></p>

      </h3>
      <p>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.newsagencyblog.com.au/2008/10/03/calendar-strategy-delivers-results.html">Australian Newsagency Blog<br /><br /></a></p><blockquote><p>Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston.</p>

<p>At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season.</p>

<p>At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously
this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on
a more unique range of titles. We have given over a column at the front
of the store to promote our calendar range as well as to feature a <strong>Calendar of the Week</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually when people talk about a &quot;calendar of the week&quot;, they talk about &quot;a calendar of the next week's events&quot;.&nbsp; Here, we have &quot;an entirely new calendar of the year, so that if you gave up on last week's calendar because you got bored of seeing pictures of fuzzy bunnies, here's a new one of fuzzy kittens.&quot;</p>

<p>Remarkable (and a great idea).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every week on Thursday I host a lunch at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor; you're invited.&nbsp; One regular element of that lunch is helping figure out what events are happening the upcoming weekend and weeks ahead so that people can find help in publicizing those events or tell people about something they are looking forward to.</p>

<p>I've tried a zillion difficult ways to keep the calendar for that group, none of which are ideal, mostly because they involve some kind of calendar system which requires more precision than I have time to deal with and which makes me type things into fields.</p>

<p>The hack (and really it's a hack) for the last few weeks has been to use <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Talk:A2b3">the talk page on the group's page on Arborwiki as a public calendar, </a>or more precisely, to use it for me as a quick place to cut and paste things so that when the time comes I know enough to tell people about that.&nbsp; An interesting advantage to doing it in wiki vs. in a calendar system is that I can hyperlink e.g. the name of a theater to the page for that theater and get (for free) all of the location and venue information along with it.</p>

<p>Is it perfect?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is there some refinement of it which might work better?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Is it handy?&nbsp; You bet.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote up a list of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/ten_places_to_h.html">ten places to have a birthday party for kids in Ann Arbor</a> about a year ago; it's proven to be a popular post.&nbsp; I thought I'd do a new list completely different from the first.&nbsp; As always check for availability and pricing before you plan.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Frisinger_Park">Frisinger Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A few picnic tables near the playground with lots of things to do for
kids (slides, swings, a merry-go-round, a sandbox) and a big field to run in. Shady for
those hot days. Avoid it on football Saturdays. Free.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Gallup_Park">Gallup Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A dock on the Huron River is perfect for a party where the kids go fishing. (worms work great).&nbsp; There's a snack bar with coffee for the adults, and a play area with lots of things to climb and bounce on.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; Get your fishing license online with the <a href="http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp">Michigan DNR E-License.</a></p>

<p>3.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.exhibits.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/publicprogrms/planetarium/">Exhibit Museum Planetarium</a> (indoors).&nbsp; They're closed as of this writing, preparing to install a new all-digital projection system; sign up for their mailing list to find out more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>4.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_Firehouse_Museum">Michigan Firehouse Museum</a>, Ypsilanti (indoors).&nbsp; Old fire engines are the draw in this museum located in an old fire house near Ypsi's Depot Town.&nbsp; </p>

<p>5.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jiffy_Mix">Jiffy Mix factory tour</a>, Chelsea (indoors).&nbsp; Tour the factory, see how Jiffy Mix is made.&nbsp; Age 6 and up, tours Mon-Fri, so it's probably a summer time event or a holiday event.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Southern_Michigan_Railroad_Society">Southern Michigan Railroad Society,</a> Clinton MI.&nbsp; Museum train runs from Clinton to Tecumseh on the old Jacksonburgh and Palymra track; there's a museum in Clinton with old railroad stuff on the main floor and a working shop downstairs for repair of their rolling stock.&nbsp; Call them to see how they handle groups.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem's_Fruit_Farm">Wasem's Fruit Farm</a>, Milan MI.&nbsp; Take the crew out for apple picking or pumpkin picking, watch the donut robot make delicious <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Donuts">donuts.</a>&nbsp; Call ahead to see if they will be making cider, they don't always do it on busy weekends.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Cider_Mill">Dexter Cider Mill</a>, Dexter MI.&nbsp; No apples to pick here - they bring them in - but a great old cider press in the basement of this old mill on the Huron River.&nbsp; Again, donuts.&nbsp; (Mmm, donuts.)&nbsp; Watch for flying insects!</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ray_Fisher_Stadium">Ray Fisher Stadium</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Take the team to a University of Michigan baseball game during the spring season.&nbsp; </p>

<p><p>10.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Yost_Ice_Arena">Yost Ice Arena</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Look for wintertime open skate times.</p><br /></p>

      <p>Here's a review of what people were looking for to find this weblog in previous Octobers.&nbsp; Some of this tells me what I should write about this year, and other parts of it tell me what fads came and went.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+trick+or+treat+hours">Ann Arbor trick or treat hours (search)</a>: Every year I try to post a complete list of trick or treat hours for the area; here's the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/halloween_trick.htm">2005,</a> <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/halloween_trick.html">2006,</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/halloween-trick.html ">2007</a> lists.&nbsp; This year if I'm ambitious I'll try to get a list of any special events by neighborhood.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders">Michigan spiders (search</a>): One of the most popular October pages is a writeup I did on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/brown_recluse_s.html ">the brown recluse spider</a> two years ago; a recent one on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/pumpkin-spider.html">the pumpkin spider</a> should be good too.&nbsp; It's not a coincidence that spiders are part of Halloween decorations!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=noguchi+filing+system">Noguchi filing system (search):</a>&nbsp; In October 2005 I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/noguchi_filing_.html ">Noguchi filing system</a>, a time-centered approach to filing and memory by a Japanese economist that William Lise had described on his translation web site.&nbsp; Interest spiked ever so briefly in August 2006.&nbsp; Subsequently Lise pulled his excellent descriptive text from the net in response to piracy of his text.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.noguchi.co.jp/">The Yukio Noguchi web site is all in Japanese</a> but may help in some way to help you reconstruct this system from his original works describing it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A follow up on the earlier post about the commercialization of the internet -</p>

<p>Once the basic data infrastructure of the Internet was open to commercial use - which starts in late 1991, and accelerates rapidly from there - you start to get slowly and then at a rapidly accelerating pace the appearance of businesses online who are selling things to people directly.</p>

<p>Some milestones there as well:</p>

<p>1993: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011221102015/www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,299047,00.html">Fry Multimedia launches web sites for Godiva, Ragu</a>; mostly marketing and advertising not sales.<br />December 1993: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n2_v13/ai_16675341/pg_4">Jon Zeeff in Ann Arbor's Branch Mall adds Grant's Flower and Greenhouse for online floral delivery;</a> he gets 40 orders via the Internet for Mother's Day, compared to 45 via FTD.<br />1994: First Virtual Holdings founded; enables internet based credit card payments.<br />July 1995: Amazon.com goes online<br />1995: Netcom, an Internet service provider, loses 20000 credit card numbers to online hackers.</p>

<p>The tipping point in retrospect is when people are willing to type their credit card numbers into web sites to order products.&nbsp; First Virtual was built on the assumption that you needed new infrastructure because card numbers were so risky; Amazon could launch without that assumption a year and some later and cope with shy buyers by providing alternate methods for getting card numbers to the system.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-gno-organizing/">#gno: organizing a network-wide chat on twitter</a>
      </h3>
      <p>#gno stands for &quot;Girl's Night Out&quot;.&nbsp; It's trending right now on search.twitter.com.&nbsp; (Yes I am up late; but this is fascinating, I've never seen this particular behavior on twitter before.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see topics trend on search.twitter.com when there are a lot of hipster people in some hipster city at some hipster tech conference.&nbsp; A zillion people who are all mostly in the same building will use the same tag to post comments on the event.&nbsp; At this point that's &quot;ordinary&quot;.</p>

<p>#gno is different - it's a virtual event, <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/search/label/twitter%20GNO">synchronized in time and organized by this loosely affiliated collection of what are charmingly called these days &quot;mommybloggers&quot;.</a>&nbsp; The time sync is important, so that everyone is on the same page, but not everyone knows each other or follows each other on twitter.&nbsp; This made their first couple of rounds of attempts somewhat frustrating.</p>

<p>The new go-around though seems to be catching on enough that it's a #1 hit (in the twitter universe of 15 minutes of fame), even outpacing the LA earthquake (3.0 magnitude) and perpetual favorite Sarah Palin.&nbsp; How did they do it?</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Loosely coupled networks - blog networks - where there are lots of people linking to each other.&nbsp; If you had been part of this network you would have known about it from multiple sources.&nbsp; Like a lot of internet ideas, one way to spread it is to <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/2008/09/first-evah-twitter-gno.html">link to all the people who are part of it (example here)</a> and get them to reciprocate.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Tightly synchronized timing - a twitter schedule - where lots of people are asked to show up at a particular time.&nbsp; The time is key; if you say &quot;some time tonight&quot; you'll get a lot less peak time traffic than if you say &quot;11pm Eastern on the dot&quot;.&nbsp; And while lots of traffic over a long time is interesting, peak traffic is what makes you visible outside your bubble.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; A willingness to iterate on tools.&nbsp; To make this work you need to set some guidelines so that new people joining the network have a recipe to follow to let them be part of it; at the same time, you need to be prepared to switch that recipe from week to week to make it work better or if the tools themselves change.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Someone to be a (nominal or actual) leader who can count noses, decide things, set the network into motion, collect people who are at the fringe and welcome them in, and post the results to improve next time you do it.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp; Low risk cost of entry into the world (all you have to do is type this tag) and access to a user population who is willing to experiment once on something.</p>

<p>Pretty neat, replicable I suppose.&nbsp; You should be able to draw parallels from ham radio, where DX contests get a lot of people on the air at once.&nbsp; There's a similar effect during University of Michigan football games, where when &quot;Michigan&quot; starts to trend you can count on finding other alumni and fans from around the world tuning in.&nbsp; Television shows synchronize people remarkably well (almost terrifying how well).</p>

<p>More from an earlier post: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/11/what-does-mean-.html">What does # mean on Twitter? All about octothorpetags. </a>which I wrote in November 2007 after #sandiegofire.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A friend asks, &quot;when did the Internet go commercial&quot;?&nbsp; Here's something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.</p>

<p>1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds<br />1989: <a href="http://www.std.com/">Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA</a> goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.<br />1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.<br />1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet<br />1991: <a href="http://www.msen.com">MSEN</a> goes online as one of the first commercial ISPs in Michigan.&nbsp; <br />1993: ANS CO+RE joins CIX</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0001.121;view=text#idno_3336451.0001.121">Internet Cost Structures and Interconnection Agreements</a> goes into (too much) details about how the money flows between commerical networks; it is a viewpoint from 1995 of the Internet then.&nbsp; But basically I'd put a date as August 1991 when you could buy an internet connection from one commercial provider and use it to send data to a customer on another commercial provider and not violate any acceptable use politics along the way.</p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From my inbox:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>
with a body about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger
than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my
house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> is only there during evening and night. We think it hides in the bush the rest of the day.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we found it I did a lot of research and I am pretty sure that it is an Araneus trifolium (<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span>, shamrock <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>).
It has the rings around the legs and is the right size. It is in the
right time of year, has the right type of web, and has the right kind
of behavior.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know whether it’s male or female. How do I figure out? Are
Araneus Trifolium poisonous? Are they common where we live? Can you
look at the pictures and figure out if I’m right and it is Araneus
trifolium? (they are attached)</p></blockquote><p>and my response:</p></p>

<p>Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pictures of your <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>.&nbsp; It looks like it is enjoying this time of year!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> spiders are very common this time of year, and they are found all over Michigan.&nbsp; Spiders can be very hard to identify from photos, because there are so many species of them, but it seems that you have made a good identification.<br />
<br />
The reference I'm looking at is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257">http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a><br />
<br />
Shorthouse, David P. submitted. Taxonomic and natural history description of FAM: ARANEIDAE, Araneus trifolium (Hentz, 1847). In: The Nearctic <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span> Database. David P. Shorthouse (editor). World Wide<br />
Web electronic publication. Direct link:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257"> http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a> (Accessed:<br />
9/28/2008 10:55:02 PM).<br />
<br />
which describes both males and females of this species.&nbsp; From that page it seems that females are more often seen later in the season, that they are larger than the males, and that their distinctive leg rings (&quot;annulations&quot;) are more distinctive than the males.&nbsp; So I'm guessing that it's a female, but you<br />
should try to measure its size to compare against that reference.&nbsp; (One way to do that in photos is to put something of known size, like a coin, next to the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> when you photograph it.)<br />
<br />
A second reference is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/11644/bgpage">http://bugguide.net/node/view/<wbr></wbr>11644/bgpage</a><br />
<br />
which is the Bug Guide, which is hosted by Iowa State University Entomology. They have lots of pictures, as well as an identification service.&nbsp; Their photos match up with your photos so you're again probably confirming that identification.<br />
<br />
As to the question of danger from <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites, the Michigan DNR has a page on insects and spiders:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204---,00.html">http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,<wbr></wbr>1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204--<wbr></wbr>-,00.html</a><br />
<br />
which talks about the two known spiders of medical importance in Michigan, the Northern Black Widow and the Brown Recluse.&nbsp; Since it's not one of those, you shouldn't worry about it being dangerous.&nbsp; In fact I searched google for the phrase<br />
<br />
&quot;<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites&quot;<br />
<br />
and got no hits.&nbsp; You might find this search interesting too:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=pumpkin+spider&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">http://www.google.com/trends?<wbr></wbr>q=<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span>+<span class="nfakPe">spider</span>&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=<wbr></wbr>all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0</a><br />
<br />
which shows that people look for <span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> spiders this time of year!</p>

I&rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place

and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&rsquo;t
buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that
you have enough.</p></blockquote><p>This weekend&rsquo;s project is emptying out bits of the garage that have accumulated reusable leftovers from the summer&rsquo;s kitchen project.&nbsp; We took a couple of windows to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Reuse_Center">Reuse Center on S.

<p>In thinking about how to identify the things that need to go, I'm back to notes I wrote about seiri.&nbsp; The approach here is to use red tags to identify things that don't belong, and then to systematically remove the things that don't belong so that no red tags are left and no new red tags appear.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/48871860/">The most interesting thing I've written about seiri </a>was written on paper, so you can see the scan.&nbsp; I want to go back and do the red tag thing online in some clever way.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&nbsp; I'm looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you'd get in &quot;petabytes per container&quot;.</p>

<p>The answer appears to be &quot;about one petabyte per six linear feet of container&quot;, or put another way, &quot;about one petabyte per ten cubic meters of containerized storage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/web/petabox.php">The Internet Archive's Petabox design specs:</a> included requirements to run in a shipping container.</p>

<p>How big is a shipping container? <a href="http://blog.managednetworks.co.uk/it-support/googles-20-petabytes/"> If a grain of rice is one byte, a shipping container can hold a half a gigabyte,</a> and a petabyte covers central London in a meter of rice.&nbsp; So, a lot.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; shelf mount computing systems, for example, are disclosed. The modular
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; center generally includes a modular computing module including an
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; intermodal shipping container and computing systems mounted within the
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; container and configured to be shipped and operated within the container
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and a temperature control system for maintaining the air temperature
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; surrounding the computing systems. The intermodal shipping container may
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; be configured in accordance to International Organization for
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Standardization (ISO) container manufacturing standards or otherwise
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; configured with respect to height, length, width, weight, and/or lifting
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; points of the container for transport via an intermodal transport
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; infrastructure. The modular design enables the modules to be cost
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; effectively built at a factory and easily transported to and deployed at
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a data center site.

<p><a href="http://www.rackable.com/products/icecube.aspx">Rackable Systems has the ICECube, at 7.1 petabytes per 40 foot container:</a></p><blockquote><p>Rackable Systems’ award-winning ICE Cube™ data center solution delivers 
extreme server and storage density in a self-contained, fully portable 20’ 
or 40’ container. Its advanced cooling design dramatically cuts ongoing 
operational expenses as does its easy serviceability. First deployed in March, 
2007, the latest generation ICE Cube more than doubles the maximum density to 
2800 independent servers per container—for up to 22,400 cores in a 40' x 
8' container. For storage-focused deployments, the ICE Cube is capable of housing 
up to 7.1 Petabytes of data. Designed to augment or replace traditional brick-and-mortar 
data centers of any size, these high densities are achieved while offering a broader 
choice of container sizes and configurability of Rackable Systems’ Eco-Logical™ 
servers and storage.</p></blockquote><p>The best researchy piece I found on this is from <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/01/11/microsoft-confirms-data-center-in-a-box/">Chuck Thacker of Microsoft Research, via a piece in Data Center Knowledge in January 2008 </a></p><blockquote><p>In October Thacker gave a presentation at the Stanford Networking Seminar titled “Rethinking Data Centers” (available in <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/seminars/10_25_07.ppt">PowerPoint</a>)
that examined various approaches to “data center in a box” approach to
portable data centers. Thacker’s slides describe an approach using
40-foot containerized data centers packed with 32 energy-efficient
racks, each filled with 40 1U servers. Using 64 of those containers
would result in a data center facility filled with 82,000 servers and
using 16 megawatts of power.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/">Stanford Networking Seminar </a>schedule shows a bunch of interesting talks, some with slides, almost all with speaker bios, recommended.&nbsp; Here's the description of this talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Microsoft builds several data centers each year, with each center containing in excess of fifty thousand servers.&nbsp; This is 
quite expensive, and we'd like to reduce the capital and operating expenses for these centers.</p>

<p>
This talk suggests that an effective way to do this is to treat the data center as a system, rather than focusing on the 
individual components such as networking and servers.&nbsp; I'll describe one way this could work, with a particular focus on the 
networking infrastructure. </p></blockquote>

      <p>Party like it's what year?</p><blockquote><p>The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: </p>

<p>First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. </p>

<p>Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency. </p>

<p>Third, such financial helplessness, in the country at large, that gold has to be bought or borrowed instantly in huge quantity from other countries, and that emergency expedients have to be adopted to provide the necessary medium of exchange for ordinary business. </p>

<p>Fourth, the shutting down of manufacturing enterprises, suddenly and on a large scale, chiefly because of absolute inability to get credit, but partly also because of fear that demand from consumers will suddenly disappear. </p>

<p>Fifth, fulfilment of this last misgiving, in the shape of abrupt disappearance of the buying demand throughout the country, this particular phenomenon being prolonged through a period of months and sometimes years.</p></blockquote><p>Answer below.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (<span class="normal"><a href="http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg368.html"><em>Latrodectus mactans</em> Fabricius</a>) </span>on September 7, 2008.&nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System's Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.</p>

<p>The best news article on this is from the <a href="http://www.thedailynews.cc/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=2&amp;ArticleID=22139">Greenville, MI Daily News</a>, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.&nbsp; A quote from this article:</p><blockquote><p>Doug Reeves,
assistant chief of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources'
Wildlife Division, said he's seen about seven northern black widows,
&quot;usually when I'm digging around woodpiles.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They're not particularly rare but they're not something that's found, unless you look in the right habitat,&quot; Reeves said.<br /><br />Doctors told Gregory that his was one of only one or two southern black widow bites ever recorded in Michigan.<br /><br />&quot;They told him he would have a much better chance of winning the lottery,&quot; Margaret Gregory said.<br /><br />Reeves
said he'd never before heard of a southern black widow bite in the
state. However, Reeves said he's heard of other cases where non-native
spiders and snakes have come into the state through international
shipments, as was the case with Brad Gregory and his southern black
widow.</p></blockquote><p>The southern black widow spider is not a common Michigan spider.</p>

<p>Some more reading:</p>

<p><a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Latrodectus_mactans.html">Latrodectus mactans on the Animal Diversity Web</a>, a good survey, on its habitat:</p><blockquote><p>A terrestrial environment is the habitat of the <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>.
It is ubiquitous and builds strong-walled retreats quite close to the
ground and in dark sheltered spots. However, it also spreads its snares
over plants. Webs of the black widow spider can be found in recesses
under stones or logs in a woodpile, in crevices or holes in dirt
embankments, in barns and outbuildings. They can also be found around
lids of dust bins, around seats of outdoor privies, spaces under chips
of wood, around stacked materials of any kind, in deserted animal
burrows or rodent holes, and entwined in grape arbors. This spider may
find its way into clothing or shoes and occasionally seeks a spot in a
house to build a web, but it is usually not found indoors. When it does
seek shelter in a building, it is due to cold weather and a need for a
dry shelter. In addition, in the eastern United States, <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>
is associated with littered areas, with dumps of large cities, with
garages, and storage sheds. In arid parts of Arizona, this spider
inhabits almost every crevice in the soil and its nests are found in
cholla cacti and agave plants. (Ferrand, 1988; Kaston, 1953;
