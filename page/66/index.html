<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>There was a brief interlude after Halloween to allow for Election Season, but then all of the orange-themed holiday items were swept away from the stores and are now replaced by green and red themed holiday items.&#0160; (New packaging, same stuff.)&#0160; That was what it looked like both at Kroger and at Caribou Coffee yesterday, quite disconcerting to go with the 60+ degree weather.</p>
<p>Kroger had a large clock up in view of the checkout lanes with a countdown timer until Christmas, something like this one (except a lot cheaper).</p>
<p><br /><br /> <iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=superpatron-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=B001DUP1AK&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#39;m a fan of countdown timers as a personal management tool; set a widget to beep after 15 minutes and do one thing until then.&#0160; <a href="http://www.baldgeeks.com/3-2-1.htm">(I&#39;m using the 3-2-1 timer from BaldGeeks on my Mac.)</a> It helps, for instance, to make sure that you don&#39;t miss the bus for a meeting, and it helps to make sure that the kids know just how long they can stay in bed before school starts. But the xmasy themed technology goes a little too far.&#0160; (Besides, I&#39;m counting the days until Groundhog Day, and there is no market for marmot-themed plastic.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two days after the election, and enough of the aftermath and peak traffic of the day has settled so that we can learn a few lessons from what happened.</p><p><strong>0. Party in the streets!</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.shawnsninja.com/2008/11/05/students-march-on-ann-arbor-after-obama-wins-election/">Shawn Smith</a> captured this moment in Ann Arbor. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=e4e78e1790&amp;photo_id=3004839740&amp;show_info_box=true" /> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761" /> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" bgcolor="#000000" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=e4e78e1790&amp;photo_id=3004839740&amp;flickr_show_info_box=true" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=61761" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" /></object>

</p><p><strong>1.&#0160; Design for infinite traffic.</strong></p><p>Election reporting is perhaps the best reason to look at cloud computing as a system for dealing with peak load needs.&#0160; Demand for election information is very intense for a few hours, and then goes away.&#0160; Any system that you build that involves a stack of your own equipment sitting in some machine room is going to be too big for most of the time, and then too small when you need it most.</p><p>As an example, the fancy maps from <a href="http://twittervotereport.com">Twitter Vote Report</a> were down mid-day, but came back up when they reconfigured the site.&#0160; </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://twitter.com/votereport/status/990021531">RT networkredux &quot;@votereport increase to 8 3.0Ghz cores on the primary web VM seemed to steady things a bit.&quot;</a></p>
<p>
As another example, Nate Silver&#39;s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> is hosted on Google&#39;s Blogger platform.&#0160; How many cores did that site run on?&#0160; As many as Google had available for the task.&#0160; And when push came to shove, <a href="http://www.contentious.com/2008/11/04/fivethirtyeightcom-runs-on-blogger-wha/">Blogger wasn&#39;t up to the task at the heat of the moment either.</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re here and trying to publish, just can&#39;t.&#0160; They can&#39;t handle the traffic.&#0160; Sorry everybody.<br /><br /></div><p>Election night is an enormously busy night; if there was ever a time to design for one day of traffic, this is it.&#0160; I&#39;m not sure how you can budget for infinite demand.</p>
<p><strong>2.&#0160; In 2008, every page is about the elections.</strong></p><p>Whether it&#39;s internet advertising, campaign coverage, partisan bickering, technology development, or just reporting on what&#39;s going on around town, it seems like every page on the whole Internet was about the elections.&#0160; It reminded me eerily of 1999, when every page was about the Year 2000, and a legion of programmers was employed fixing things; will the end of the 2008 campaign ad spend (<a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3631249">projected at $17 million online</a>) lead to the end of the web 2.0 era?</p><p><strong>3.&#0160; Sending &quot;I voted&quot; to your network gets your network to vote.</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know this for sure; it&#39;s hard to tell from anecdotal reports, but my sense is that people who are using systems like Facebook and Twitter which make it easy to report that they voted are more likely to get their friends to vote.&#0160; </p><p>Facebook in particular made this easy with the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/about">Causes</a> application that let you &quot;donate your status message&quot; in advance to pre-scheduled reminders to your friends to vote.&#0160; <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/11/04/facebook-causes-helping-to-get-out-the-vote-on-election-day/">This get out the vote effort was given front page status with a rolling ticker on election day.</a>&#0160; Causes recorded <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/election?m=bd6ad275&amp;_fb_fromhash=a55921e67257c4c26608ca3f1d13fe3c">1.7 million voters, who voted 70% to 21% for Obama,</a> and now they know at least as much as any exit poll ever did.</p><p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/marketing-lesso.html">Seth Godin writes more on this topic.</a></p><p><strong>4.&#0160; There are problems with voting systems everywhere.</strong></p><p>The sad conclusion of watching Twitter and #votereport for a few hours makes it clear that as voting turnout increases, the chances for things to go wrong go up.&#0160; Whether it&#39;s inadequate support at polling places leading to long lines, bad line control putting people in the wrong line to vote, or problems with ballots or machines, it&#39;s easy to find people who ran into snags and snafus.</p><p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/amazing-vote-reports/">Andrew Turner posts a recap of the amazing vote reports that the #votereport project gathered</a> - both good stories and bad about how things worked.&#0160; There&#39;s a lot more to learn from that project and they have an awesome dataset to look at for review of where things went wrong (and where they went right). </p><p><strong>5.&#0160; Practice makes perfect.</strong></p><p>I voted using the Accumark system.&#0160; It was mostly painless, helped in large part by having done it enough times that I knew what was likely to fail.&#0160; The poll worker there knew that I needed to tear off the strip on top of the ballot before feeding it into the marking machine - the simple solution to most of the reported problems with the device - in part because this was my third time through this same precinct with the same voting machine and we figured it out before.</p><p><strong>6.&#0160; (something about polls)</strong></p><p>Nate Silver at <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> is still going over the differences between poll data and actual vote counts, but it&#39;s clear: there&#39;s a widespread, systematic, and unpredictable difference between what people say they will do to pollsters and what they actually do in the voting booth.&#0160;&#0160; FiveThirtyEight did an amazing job at correcting for systematic poll bias, but even with all that there were still a few surprises (Indiana?!?) where you just couldn&#39;t know.</p><p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/unpublished/electionnight.pdf">A paper by Andrew Gelman and Nate Silver circulated in the afternoon of election day,</a> on statistics and conditional probabilities, predicting Obama 99% if he wins Virginia based on scenario analysis.</p><p><strong>7.&#0160; Prepare ahead of time</strong></p><p>My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/michigan-2008-election-results.html">Michigan Election Results</a> page this year was easy to write because I had written the same page in previous elections, knew where the results would be, and knew crucially which search terms people would be using.&#0160; I made it relevant before results came in by posting where the election parties would be.&#0160; You know these things are going to happen because they happened before; there&#39;s no reason to need to scramble at the last minute to put something together.</p><p>---<br />Lessons learned from previous events, for better or worse:</p><p>Hurricane season - <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/gustav-social-m.html">Gustav lessons learned</a><br />Disaster relief and reporting - the process of the <a href="http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA368651">&quot;after action review&quot;</a> as derived from US Army practice<br /><a href="http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2005/10/today_i_publicl.html">Aviation safety compared to computer security</a></p>

      </h3>
      <p>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly
part of the same easy to define train of thought.  It&rsquo;s
&ldquo;note to self&rdquo;, or &ldquo;note to future self&rdquo;, for the sorts of things
that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again.
It&rsquo;s notes about places I&rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&rsquo;d like to go
to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get
interested enough in something to write down what I find out about
it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that
find it (and more) so I can learn more.</p>

<p>The result was described by someone as &ldquo;it looks like part of a
bigger project, but I don&rsquo;t know what it is&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let me describe the bigger project in words that I used in 1998
when I launched some earlier version of this project as the Vacuum
mailing list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can people organize in their minds and personal interactions
information about a network so large that strains the limits of the
imagination? Vacuum tries to provide insight, tools, and clues to find
out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was 1998, about 10 years ago - the net was a lot smaller
then. I marvel at its complexity now.&nbsp; But for the most
part I don&rsquo;t try to do anything other than help answer this continuing
question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to take <a
href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret">a systematic approach
to self-instruction at my new blog called The Bloggers&rsquo;s Secret</a>,
but as always understanding what you already know in a format that
lets you tell others about it is a continuous work.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>More

      <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/polenta">delicious tag polenta</a>, from the blog <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/">Hungry Cravings</a> - the so called <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/2008/10/cheater-method.html">Cheater Method Polenta</a>.</p><p>The critics were skeptical:</p><div class="msg">

Serve with a sauce on top.</p><p>The original recipe has more spices (hot pepper flakes) and more substance (cheese, pepperoni), but I thought I&#39;d bring it back to basics for the start.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-fire.html">The City of Ann Arbor has started an email-based delivery service for changes and updates to the city&#39;s web site run by GovDelivery.</a>&#0160; I contacted Dave Sommerness, a University of Michigan graduate and their COO, to find out more.</p><p><strong>
How did your organization get started, and who was your first customer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govdelivery.com">GovDelivery</a>, Inc. was started in 1999 by our two co-founders, CEO Scott Burns and EVP of Sales Zach Stabenow. &#0160;We developed the GovDelivery Digital Subscription Management system in 2000 in collaboration with the City of St. Paul, who had a need for reliable communication with its residents. &#0160;We found this need to be pervasive across public sector organizations, and it&#39;s taken off quite well from there.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Government web sites are built with all kinds of technologies. &#0160;How do you manage the process so that it all looks the same to the user?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We integrate with client sites by simple links on their web pages. &#0160;The effect is seamless because we customize our web and email templates to match the look-and-feel of each client. &#0160;Behind the scenes GovDelivery is deployed as a multi-tenant, SaaS system, so Ann Arbor is using the same basic application as our other clients.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
The service I signed up for was an email based one. &#0160;What are your plans for looking at web 2.0 technologies for notification, e.g. using something like Twitter to do messaging?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We&#39;re always looking forward to new technologies and applications to our system/market. &#0160;A couple years ago we added RSS capability, so our clients can publish their messages as RSS feeds in addition to sending them out through email. &#0160;We&#39;ve seen a lot of excitement in our market over Web 2.0 technologies, so we&#39;re developing functionality to take advantage of that and promote more options for communication and collaboration between government and citizens. &#0160;A few examples of Web<br />
2.0 notification that we already support include automatically posting messages to blogs, updating a Facebook page, and using public RSS feeds to publish bulletins to widgets.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Do you work with libraries as part of your business, and if so, can you share some good stories from those implementations?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>The majority of our experience has been with government bodies - from small cities and counties up to the largest federal departments - and transit authorities, though we have some experience with education,<br />
non-profits, and other organizations. &#0160;We work with a number of libraries, mainly through city accounts, but the most notable stand-alone library account is the Library of Congress.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
What makes St. Paul a good place to run this business from, and not Silicon Valley or Washington, DC?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>Good business is about good people, and there&#39;s a great pool of talent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. We&#39;re one of the fastest growing software companies in the area, which attracts talented people and helps us to retain and keep them challenged. &#0160;We don&#39;t have the issues that Silicon Valley has where folks are more apt to jump to the next flavor of the day. &#0160;Because of the density of clients in D.C., we do maintain a sales office and staff there, which we plan to grow as the business does.</p><p><strong>
Who do you root for when Michigan plays Minnesota?</strong></p><p>I grew up a Bulldog hockey fan in Duluth - the Gophers were big rivals, so it&#39;s been tough for me to become a fan of any of their teams. &#0160;The real dilemma for me would be if Michigan ever played UMD in hockey.</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks Dave!</p>

   <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
   <p>A
conference of invited presentations is to be held in Ann Arbor on
November 7-9 2008 to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Language
Learning and to explore a paradigm shift currently taking place across
the language sciences, the growing realization of Language as a Complex
Adaptive System.</p>
   <p> Language Learning was first
published from the University of Michigan in 1948. Its subtitle then
was &quot;A Quarterly Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;; indeed the beginnings
of &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; have been attributed to this usage. In the 60
years since, the subtitle has evolved to become &quot;A Journal of Research
in Language Studies&quot; reflecting our mission: </p><blockquote><p>Language Learning is a scientific journal
dedicated to the understanding of language learning broadly defined. It
publishes research articles that systematically apply methods of
inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive
science, educational inquiry, neuroscience, ethnography,
sociolinguistics, sociology, and semiotics. It is concerned with
fundamental theoretical issues in language learning such as child,
second, and foreign language acquisition, language education,
bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain,
culture, cognition, pragmatics, and intergroup relations.</p></blockquote>
   
   <p>The
conference in 2008 will mark our 60th anniversary and our remarkable
success towards these ends. Members of the board, past editors, our
colleagues at Wiley-Blackwell, and friends and confederates in this
enterprise are gathering to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The topic of
the conference is Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent
research across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, and changes over time. However, there is mounting
evidence that processes of language acquisition, use, and change are
not independent from one another but are facets of the same complex
adaptive system. This theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues
from different branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems
(including Clay Beckner, Richard Blythe, Joan Bybee, Morten H.

Diane Larsen-Freeman, and Tom Schoenemann) at a meeting at the Santa Fe
Institute in 2007. &quot;The Five Graces Group&quot; (named after their rather
special accommodations there) are offering a position paper on Language
as a Complex Adaptive System as the introductory piece for the
conference followed by ten individual papers that discuss substantive
areas of language from this perspective. The authors of these ten
papers are active in their recognition of complexity in their
respective areas, ranging from language usage, structure and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing. Discussion of these
papers will be led by members of the board of Language Learning in
order to contextualize these influences within Applied Linguistics and
the Language Sciences more generally.</p>
   <p>Written papers
based on these presentations will form a special issue of the journal
Language Learning (2009, Volume 59, Supplement 1). The proceedings will
also be recorded and later made available through Wiley-Blackwell and
the University of Michigan as a webcast.</p><p>The previous day there&#39;s a seminar on campus:</p><h3><font color="red">Emergence in Physical, Biological, and Social Systems III</font></h3>
<h3>November 7, 2008</h3>
<h3>340 West Hall, University of Michigan</h3>
<h3>9 am-4:30 pm</h3>

<h3>Talks and Poster Session open to the public</h3>
<br />
<p>
Our goal is to help
encourage the formation of a coherent community of researchers on
campus grouped around
the general theme of complexity, emergence, and collective effects.
This third ICAM meeting at the University of Michigan is timed to
connect to the University of Michigan conference on <a href="http://elicorpora.info/LLC/overview">&quot;Language as a Complex Adaptive System&quot;</a> (Nov.8-9, 2008)</p>

      <p>(from the ICOS mailing list)</p><p>Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common<br />
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.</p><p><a href="http://icos.cms.si.umich.edu/sites/icos.cms.si.umich.edu/files/Espeland.pdf">The Discipline of Rankings: 
Public Measures, Decoupling, and Organizational Change (PDF)</a></p><p>Michael Sauder

<br /><a href="http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/espeland/home.html">Wendy Espeland 
Northwestern University </a></p><p>This article demonstrates the value of Foucault‟s conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault‟s 
depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings 
change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This 
approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the 
prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the 
external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to 
buffer or hide some activities. Members‟ tendency to internalize these pressures, to 
become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that 
rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and 
by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of 
performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional 
environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a 
crucial task for scholars.

infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with
foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of
cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not
related—they are caused by different viruses. Humans do not get the
animal disease, and animals do not get the human disease.<br /></div><br /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Treatment and Medical Management </strong></h3>

children under age 12 years.</p>
<p>Salt water mouth rinses (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon of salt to 1 glass of warm
water) may be soothing if the child is able to rinse without
swallowing. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids. Extra fluid is
needed when a fever is present. The best fluids are cold milk products.

      <p><a href="http://www.lucidninja.com/2008/03/28/blogger-spotlight-missy-caulk/">Missy Caulk</a> is doing a seminar at Keller Williams about blogging in real estate in the Ann Arbor market.&#0160; Some impressionistic notes.</p><p>&quot;Google likes fresh content&quot; - static content with 10 years worth of stuff that is mostly the same.</p><p>Examples of real estate content - information about schools, neighborhoods, real estate issues.</p><p>Blog to learn, blog to grow, blog to share, blog for relationships.</p><p>&quot;MIssy, you need to do more hyperlocal&quot; = become an expert on that subdivision.&#0160; </p><p>As people get closer to buying a home, their searches get more specific; move from &quot;ann arbor real estate&quot; to something much more specific, at the neighborhood level.&#0160; If you&#39;re an expert on a neighborhood, then you can be pretty sure that someone will find what you write about that neighborhood.</p><p>Neighborhood: once a month send a postcard to a neighborhood, once a month write a blog post with statistics for that market, point the postcard to the link to the blog and tell people where to go to look.</p><p>How to get started:</p><p>Read - subscribe in rss reader (overflowing), figure out how it&#39;s done<br />Comments - when you start you might not get any comments; you will grow as a writer</p><p>When you write it&#39;s hard work - two hours to write a good post about a subdivision or golf course.&#0160; </p><p><strong>What to write about:</strong></p><p><br />* about the communities<br />* about events in the area<br />* about real estate situations<br />* about your market<br />* about a closing<br />* share your listings<br />* answer questions that buyers and sellers ask you<br />* anything and everything<br />* interview people</p><p>Right now there&#39;s a lot of open spaces - you will be found.&#0160; (but when those open spaces stop happening...)</p><p><strong>Events: </strong></p><p>Halloween events in Washtenaw County (Ed&#39;s blog came up) - haunted houses.&#0160; Do you want to write about Halloween all the time?&#0160; No - write a max 30% off-topic, 70% on-topic.&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://www.sashafarm.org/">On Manchester, MI - non-profit animal rescue (Sasha Farm, 65 acres).</a> - Missy wrote a piece about <a href="http://activerain.com/blogsview/635187/The-Village-of-Manchester">Manchester, MI </a>and got a nice note from the director of the shelter, &quot;nobody knows about us&quot;.&#0160; (nb. this is the &quot;long tail&quot; of rescue animals).</p><p><strong>Write about real estate transactions: </strong></p><p>Be careful when you write about a tough transaction - hold off before posting.&#0160; Don&#39;t post anything you don&#39;t want someone to read.&#0160;&#0160;</p><p><strong>Photos:</strong></p><p>Don&#39;t steal.</p><p>Flickr has creative commons licensed photos, follow the rules and you can use for free.</p><p>iStockPhoto - costs about $1 per photo.</p><p>Take your own photos.</p><p><strong>Video</strong>:</p><p>Flip video - USB, post to Youtube, about $100.</p><p><strong>Back links</strong></p><p>Todd Waller: 1000-5000 links to a property, using video to expose a home in every possible space.&#0160; (What good is it?)&#0160;&#0160; We want you all over the place (just happen to be in a &quot;data surfing haze&quot;) on Oodle.&#0160; Systematic, syndicated.</p><p><strong>Write down questions from buyers and sellers</strong></p><p>Take the email that you would send to one person and post it to the net (suitably edited of course).&#0160; Not just for your own clients to see, but for new clients to see.&#0160; </p><p><strong>Interviews</strong></p><p>People love to be interviewed, anyone you want to talk to write it up.&#0160; </p><p>Google for a &quot;completely different reason&quot; and you pop up.</p><p><strong>Style</strong></p><p>Less is more - 50, 60 words.&#0160; Just get it out there.</p><p>Be real, be yourself, be authentic.&#0160; Be real, find your voice, be you.&#0160; </p><p>Relate to the consumer - be transparent.&#0160; Who you are.&#0160; Things which are standardized are boring, boring, boring.&#0160; Buyers and sellers want to work with people who they like.</p><p><strong>Timing</strong></p><p>Buyers take eight months to make a decision - they read about how you do things online, and by the time you meet someone in person they know you (and trust you).</p><p><strong>Write for the search engines</strong></p><p>If you&#39;re getting started, don&#39;t think about this AT ALL.</p><p>The search engine platforms make a difference.</p><p>Don&#39;t stuff in keywords, write in natural language.</p><p>People search for lots of things, including things you wouldn&#39;t happen to write about specifically.&#0160; If you have a lot of content, relevant for a &quot;crazy search that somebody does&quot;.&#0160;&#0160; <a href="http://real-estate-net.blogspot.com/2006/07/real-estate-marketing-and-long-tail.html">(Ref &quot;Long tail&quot;

This approach is particularly useful to understand the day-to-day social and material practices of calculation. Ethnography places the researcher in the same uncertain position as his or her subjects, thereby avoiding the danger of underestimating uncertainty (Agar 1986; Spradley 1979). Its emphasis on practice taps into the actual solutions developed by the users, as opposed to those intended by the designer of the system (Orlikowski 1992; Barley 1986). Our study spans three years of observations at the equity derivatives trading room of pseudonymous International Securities, a large global investment bank with American headquarters on Wall Street. From this period, we selected a single morning of trading at the merger arbitrage desk. The combination of two years of observation with one full morning of data provides a high-frequency, highly contextualized account, in line with the literature in cognitive <br />science and distributed cognition (Hutchins 1995; Hutchins and Klausen 1992).&#0160;&#0160; </p>
