<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>Riots is of course a loaded word, but that's what the media and public safety is using. Some stories about this evening's firing of long-time Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, and Penn State president Graham Spanier, and the sometimes violent reaction on the Happy Valley campus.</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/jon_wertheim/11/09/penn.state.joe.paterno/">Sports Illustrated</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Jon) Wertheim: This university lost their president today. What Jerry Sandusky is to alleged to have done is some of the most grotesque stuff you'll ever read, but it seems to be all about Joe Paterno tonight. It's just interesting to see a new wave of emotion here. It's anger, and it's frustration, and I imagine tomorrow's going to be completely different. This story keeps jumping around.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crowds began to gather around 10 p.m. on Beaver Avenue. After police in riot gear told them to move along, the students moved to Old Main. They sang the alma mater, professed their love for Paterno and profanely denounced Sandusky. They pointed toward Penn State president Graham Spanier's still-lit office. Then, after a brief "back to Beaver" chant, the crowd returned to Beaver Avenue. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. "In addition, in certain cases, the institution must issue a timely warning if a reported crime represents a threat to the campus community," it said in a statement.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR USA, November 5-7, 2011 (Vacuum News) - There were a series of earthquakes in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, but we didn't feel them here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p>Some maps and news from people who did feel the quakes follow. The data here are preliminary, and you'll want to go to the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usb0006klz.php">USGS page for the Oklahoma quake</a> for details, and <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/history.php">Oklahoma earthquake history</a> to figure out how normal this is.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/oklahoma-earthquake-sets-a-record.html">News coverage from the New York Times</a> quotes Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey; Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center; and Justin Reese, who runs the <a href="http://boomarangdiner.com/">Boomarang Diner</a> in Chandler, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The earthquake, originally reported at magnitude 5.2 and then upgraded to 5.6, was said to be felt [as far away as Milwaukee] - a claim which is being tested and that I haven't confirmed. <a href="http://earthquakes.tafoni.net/">Additional aftershocks were reported</a>; the map is by <a href="http://www.tafoni.net/">Dawn Endico</a> using the Google Maps API.

      </h3>
      <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?</p>

<p>There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. The VC in turn provides value by vetting the value of the allegedly valuable trade secret and is prepared to say "that's not a secret, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Paul Baran started a company doing that in 1985</a>".</p>

<p>A crafty tradesman is perpetually disclosing some relevant fragments of their trade knowledge at all times, in part to demonstrate competence, and in part to test whether what they know is really true.</p>

<p>As far as disclosure of trade secrets goes, I'd be much more worried about details leaking out inadvertently via ill-considered partners and subcontractors than via an investor.</p>

      <p>THIS WEEK IN MAPS, for Sunday, October 30, 2011: A late October snowstorm is heading up the East Coast of the United States for Halloween. Here's maps of the affected areas, showing what parts of the electrical grid have had the worst impact from the heavy, wet snow in the forecast.</p>

<h2>New Hampshire</h2>

<p>As of 2:00 a.m. Sunday, 32% of PSNH customers are without power.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a>. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.</p>

<p>Google now has a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real time version of Google Analytics</a>, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it. It tells you in real time what pages are being looked at, where people are coming from to look at them, and which keywords and referring sites are driving traffic. It scratches some of the same itch that mybloglog used to scratch, when there's some kind of burst of news and you want to know what's going on in real time and not on tomorrow's reporting.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a> had something that GA doesn't have and really hasn't had: tracking of clicks not to the site you're looking at, but to something out there in the world that you linked to. That was great to use - and something that made it easy to see that you were successful as a blogger because you were driving traffic elsewhere. That's gone; maybe someone will build it, but maybe they won't.</p>

    <p>The creator of the C programming language and the co-author of the book of the same name has died.� Dennis Ritchie joined Bell Labs in 1967 and in addition to developing C was one of the developers of the Unix operating system at Bell Labs in the late 60s and in the 70s written almost entirely in C.C grew out of B which was derived by Ken Thompson from BCPL, developed at Cambridge University in 1966 by Martin Richards.</p>
    <p>I started programming in Fortran66, then played around with Ratfor, which was Fortran made to look like C, before buying my first copy of K&amp;R C.� For a Fortran programmer who also had to program some chunks in assembler to get around the limitations of Fortran, C was a liberation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.</p>
<p>The organization announced its new web site, <a href="http://northburnspark.org" target="_self">northburnspark.org</a> , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</p>
<p>Residents expressed their concerns about municipal and neighborhood issues to each other and to several area elected officials who are residents of the neighborhood, including Mayor John Hieftje, Councilman Christopher Taylor, Washtenaw County commissioner Yousef Rabhi, and the recently appointed city administrator Steve Powers. (Does Steve live in the neighborhood?) (Links to names?)</p>
<p>Noise was a concern shared by several citizens, who expressed their frustration that nearby religious services, University functions, special events and construction activity generated noise far beyond ordinary noise limits yet were exempted by permits or the University&#39;s special relationship as an autonomous body. (Link to noise articles?) (mention Big House run by name?)</p>
<p>Mayor John Hieftje addressed citizen concerns regarding crime, noting that overall crime statistics as measured according to the FBI&#39;s standard reporting criteria are down across the board. Hieftje was critical of the media&#39;s portrayal of crime issues and perceptions of crime. It was noted (by whom?) that the increased awareness of near-campus crime was due in part to the University&#39;s direct dissemination of crime information and alerts. (Explain the Cleary Act? Link to municipal maps?)</p>
<p>Residents in North Burns Park (who, specifically?) expressed specific concerns about parking in near-campus apartments, noting that landlords have converted back yards into parking lots in excess of the city standard of 4 on-site spaces for a (which, specifically?) apartment unit.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Who? A couple of petanque enthusiasts) described the courts which they had helped in getting installed at the northeast corner of Burns Park (on some date) and invited neighbors to join in their enthusiasm for the game. Petanque is a French game similar to (boules) or bocce, played with metal balls on a gravel court. Students at Burns Park Elementary School learn petanque as part of their PE classes, and (the couple) are looking forward to a June 2012 event to raise money for ALS (as part of A2A3).</p>
<p>Long term residents were happy to see each other again at this annual meeting event, and new residents were welcomed. About (how many, 35?) were in attendance. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 pm and residents ate some but not all of the cider and cookies provided before walking home.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 7, 11:30 p.m. - A house near the corner of Harpst Street and Tremmell Avenue was on fire on the evening of October 7, 2011. This photo is provided courtesy of Mike Nowak (@<a href="http://twitter.com/snackdog" target="_self">snackdog</a>) and is used with permission.

According to apartment resident Amanda Szot, there was no fire in the complex, despite the substantial amount of smoke seen there.</p>
<p>Smoke from the fire could be smelled all the way to north to East Stadium at Westminster, and as far east as East Stadium at Packard.&#0160;</p>

<p><a href="http://chezpim.com/bake/quince-caramel" target="_self">Quince caramel</a> from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious.</p>
<blockquote>The fuzzy, fragrant fruits stared at me from the countertop for a couple of days. I thought I would poach them in simple syrup and keep in the fridge. The sweetened quince and the poaching syrup make a wonderful topping for my morning yogurt. The batch that my neighbor Beccy and I made a couple of weeks ago is running out, so this would be a good time to replenish. Then the real inspiration struck, caramel! I could use the sweet poaching liquid to make quince caramels, combining two of my favorite things to eat in the world, caramel and quince – I just love quince, I even love a restaurant named after it. How wonderful would that be?</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://migraineur.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/slow-food-chicken-tagine-with-quinces/" target="_self">Chicken tagine with quinces</a> comes via The Migraineur, quoting a recipe from Larousse for the preparation but spicing it with a traditional tagine.</p>
<blockquote>Still mindful of all those recipes calling for bucketloads of sugar, I was curious about how a raw quince would taste. While preparing the dish, I cut myself a very fine sliver and ate it. The texture was like an Asian pear, pleasingly granular, but a lot drier. Mostly I got that wonderful flowery fruity fragrance. Encouraged, I cut myself a larger chunk. Wow! Talk about pucker. It was like sucking on an inferior teabag – quinces are clearly loaded with tannins. So, no, I don’t think quinces can be eaten raw. However, I am encouraged by this recipe to think that quinces do not have to be sweetened.</blockquote>
<p>Beef with Quince, aka&#0160;<a href="http://mamastaverna.com/beef-with-quince-moschari-me-kydonia/" target="_self">Moschari me Kydonia</a>, is a savory stew courtesy of Mama&#39;s Taverna.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>It’s not glamous-looking, that’s for sure, but the tartness of the quince makes it zingier than you’d expect. This is NOT a boring beef stew!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time it was del.icio.us, and it was the new cool way to use bookmarks and tagging, and I used it all the time. I put more than 10,000 bookmarks into the system. This was when Flickr was on the top of the world and before Facebook and Twitter had made much of a dent.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us turned into delicious.com, got bought by Yahoo. Some cool people started to work there supporting it. Yahoo gave it a loving embrace, and those cool people left to do other cool things. They warned me on their way out, and I moved <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">my 10,000 bookmarks</a> to <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_self">pinboard</a> and mostly stopped using both systems because I wasn&#39;t ready to invest heavily in something that other people didn&#39;t trust.</p>
<p>Yahoo sold delicious.com to the founders of Youtube, who now run a company called AVOS. By all accounts the transition hasn&#39;t gone very well, e.g. your most loyal users say that the system has been <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/avos-delicious-disaster-lessons-from-a-complete-failure/705" target="_self">mangled by carpetbaggers</a>. From Violet Blue on ZDNet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahoo! got caught with its finger on the trigger to kill Delicious, an amazing cry came up from the internets to save it. Then AVOS rode in on a white unicorn to save it. Yay!</p>
<p>But, no. What we got was our worst fears about the bubble, confirmed.</p>
<p>Delicious is a bitter lesson for everyone. It’s the difference between how people actually use a product versus how rich, out-of-touch knuckleheads think people&#0160;<strong>should be</strong>&#0160;using that product, all to further their own self-interests.</p>
<p>If you make a startup we like, such as Delicious: please don’t sell it.</p>
