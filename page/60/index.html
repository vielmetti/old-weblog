<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Here&#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow.</p><p>1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy.</p><p>2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary.&#0160; In any case, write around the start of your post.</p><p>3.&#0160; Go into your favorite blog editing tool and write enough in the input box for your post so that you fill it completely.&#0160; You aren&#39;t constrained by 140 characters there, but there&#39;s still some reasonable limit, and you don&#39;t want to go over.</p><p>Blogging is good for when you have more to say; twitter helps you say it in less words.&#0160; Use both.</p>

      <p>Bumboats are small boats used as floating shops that market to sailors in harbor.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a tradition of them on the Great Lakes; here&rsquo;s what I could find with a bit of searching.<br><br>In Duluth, Minnesota, <a href="http://www.duluthport.com/99wintspr/marinetrader.html">the Marine Trader went back to the lakes in 1998</a>:&nbsp; (via a story in Minnesota&rsquo;s World Port w/photos)<br><span  style="font-family: Arial" size="3;"><br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">On May 24, 1998, an
 old boat and an even older maritime practice both came back to life. Here’s what
 happened, as described by Franz VonRiedel: &ldquo;After 12 years of lying idle, the
 bumboat Marine Trader pulled up along-side the 650-foot self-unloader Algoway at the
 Cutler-Magner salt dock in Duluth. Up went the ladders, and the crew members of the
 Algoway scrambled down to do a little shopping … &ldquo; </font></div></p>

<p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Franz VonRiedel wrote those words as part of an
 article for a recent edition of the Nor’easter, the journal of the Lake Superior
 Marine Museum Association. Mr. VonRiedel knows bumboats, and he really knows the Marine
 Trader. He and his father, Bruce VonRiedel, own the Trader and three other small craft
 that make up their business, Acme Marine Services. </font></p>Some other bumboats on the lakes included the <a href="http://archive.boatnerd.com/archiveg/11-04/000121e4.htm">Dewey&rsquo;s and Kessler II in Toledo</a> (now scrapped), and something similar but not quite the same is the <a href="http://www.boatnerd.com/westcott/mbtnnw.htm">mail boat J.

      </h3>
      <p>I put up a little project on github last night, <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter mutual friends</a>.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.</p><p>I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</p><p>The existing Twitter feedback for these is very limited, based almost entirely on numerical counts.&#0160; I thought I could do better by examining what kind of mutual relationships already existed between me and other people and to see if I could characterize folks based on who else they followed to know at least which part of my life they might have found me by.</p><p>Thus, the twitter mutual friends effort.&#0160; The simplest version of this downloads two friend lists, and looks for overlap.&#0160; The list of overlapping ids is walked through, noting who the overlapping people are, what their last twitter was, how many people they in turn were following, and the like.&#0160; </p><p>You could look either at friends, followers, or mutual friend/follow pairs; you can derive things from the text of recent tweets from mutual friends, or their follow counts, or other second derivatives of mutuality or reciprocity.&#0160; At some point there&#39;s a nice visual of all of this, as well as some good textual analysis (&quot;trending words in our mutual followers&quot;).&#0160; But as a start this is just an effort to get beyond simple counting and into network views of twitter.</p>

<p>According to a report in The Michigan Citizen, the court earlier granted in part the prosecutor’s request to “preclude argument, the asking of questions, and the introduction of any other evidence purporting to show that defendant was acting in her capacity as a reporter during the events in question,” and “rul[ed] essentially that only Bukowski could testify regarding her role as a reporter.”</div><br />

<p>&quot;Morels can be found just about anywhere, commonly in apple orchards, around poplar trees, dying elm trees, where ferns grow, sometimes even in pines,&quot; he said. &quot;They grow on the ground. South wooded slopes are favorite spots. They often appear in the same place every year.&quot;</div><br />

      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/santa-barbara-and-montecito-t-fire.html">When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California</a>, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.</p><p>As a small public service, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/category/problems/">the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog</a>, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again.&#0160; His piece on <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2009/05/07/some-clues-for-covering-wildfires/">how the media need to do better reporting on wildfires</a> is spot on:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">With all due respect to the good jobs that most of the legacy media
are doing, their coverage could be much, much better if they paid
respect to those listening and watching online, which includes their
smart phones. What they need are plain hard facts, rather than the
vague, boiled-down or sensationalized stuff that was News As Usual for
the duration.</p><p>Take home point #3 is all you need:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Uncomplicate your damn websites</strong>. Without
exception, legacy media have websites that are far too complicated and
jam-packed with visual noise, including promotions of junk that is
highly uninteresting to visitors looking for hard facts about their
homes and neighborhoods.</p><p>There&#39;s much more news and many more photos than I can possibly link to here.&#0160; <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=jesusita">On Twitter search for #jesusita</a> or #jesusitafire for lots of information.&#0160; <a href="http://timhatch.com/panos/jesusita-fire">Tim Hatch has some panoramic photos of the fire</a>.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sundowner-stress8-2009may08,0,7680616.story">LA Times always has good wildfire coverage</a>, not the great coverage that Doc wants for his neighbors, but something to put things in perspective from miles away.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Let me explain to you why those terms don&#39;t explain things very well.</p><p>I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers.</p><p>Public accounting at the turn of the century was hard work.&#0160; Not only did you have to come to some means of doing standard categorization for hundreds or thousands of categories of events and expenditures in a typical rail operation, but you also had to manage all that data flowing back to you as print and then reconstruct it into numbers.&#0160; And then you had to make the case that one type of patented equipment was much more dangerous than another and that some private enterprise needed to be coerced, encouraged, or jawboned into making investments in public safety.</p><p>You would think that 100 plus years later, with all of our wonderful technology, that things would be better.&#0160; You&#39;d be wrong.&#0160; Government organizations and publicly regulated institutions are still primarily putting together products designed to be printed, and in most cases there is very little thought put towards the use or reuse of the data hiding inside.&#0160; </p><p>In one extreme, this shows up as hundred plus page long PDFs of scanned in images presented to board members to help them make decisions, including scanned in spreadsheets that have numerical errors that cannot be audited without rekeying.&#0160; In another extreme, it means that no two public organizations that report the number of flu cases have precisely the same number, since their reporting cycles are different and no one is adding things up except at document preparation and print time.&#0160; </p><p>You can&#39;t count on critical public information being available in non-proprietary file formats, and you can&#39;t count on non-critical public information being made openly available to the public at all.</p><p>It&#39;s so bad that people trust Wikipedia more than they trust any other source, because at least with Wikipedia you know that what you&#39;re looking at might be wrong and there&#39;s a healthy dose of skepticism that can be dealt with by examining original documents.</p><p>So if I ask for that page of numbers as the spreadsheet it was originally, and a public records officer for a public body gives it to me as a bitmap, I&#39;m going to ask again and keep asking publicly and perhaps uncomfortably until we both understand that this is a routine request and that compliance with routine requests is much easier than making everything an exception - because maybe, just maybe, I can replace that FOIA letter with a tiny shell script and we can just go about our business.</p>

shot much of the film in Davenport, Iowa and the surrounding Quad
Cities and were one of the first to take advantage of recent tax
incentives for filmmakers who spend over $100,000 in the state.</p>
<p class="blockquote MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Earlier this month Iowa
Governor Chet Culver in speaking about Iowa’s commitment to helping
filmmakers said, “Iowa has a lot to offer the film industry and, quite
frankly, we want more movies filmed in our state. As a television or
motion picture producer with the greatest of expectations, in Iowa, you
can find it all. The new film tax credit and training award send a
clear signal to Hollywood: Iowa is camera-ready and open for business.” </p>
<p>Thanks to Debbie Sobeloff for the heads up about this, who liked it when she saw it in DC because it &quot;treated all of the characters with dignity&quot;.&#0160; I don&#39;t know of any local Ann Arbor show times (not that I ever get out to the movies....)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Laundry is a chore. I&#39;m only slowly getting better at it after most of
a year of having increasing responsibilities.
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Mama mama make me clean. Every day the same routine.&#0160;
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SWX2jBT6Cm0C">Jean Marzollo</a>)<br /></div><p><br />The most important part of doing laundry once you start it is to figure
out what the cycle time is that you need to keep up to make continuous
progress, and then work with that timing in mind as you plan your
effort. If your washing machine takes 45 minutes to run, then going
downstairs 30 minutes later is a wasted trip, and going down an hour
later slows down system throughput considerably.&#0160; No one yet that I know is using any web based time to change the laundry app that monitors your appliance directly, but simple timers or even just knowing that the top of the hour is when you go down to work on it should be enough.</p><p>Laundry works best when clothes and wash are sorted before they get
dumped into the washer. This suggests that every time you put in a load
you should immediately sort the next load, so that there&#39;s no need to
wait any more time that you need to the next time the cycle runs.
Sorting is made a lot easier by having big clearly labeled baskets. (I
never have figured out the symbols.)
</p><p>One school of laundry thought says to do a load every day; the other
says to do all the wash you have to do once a week in a continuous
stream. What is best for you depends on how many kids there are getting
clothes dirty, how many days or weeks of little boy clothing you have
in your stockpile so that there&#39;s always a dry pair of clean pants
during mud puddle season, and what kind of mindless work you can do
while folding. In any case, there&#39;s little to be gained from making
laundry a random process - routines repeated every week make it all
easier.
</p><p>It&#39;s 2:00pm; I promised myself that I&#39;d go to the basement every hour
on the hour and move the process forwards. If I work at this properly
it will take less than 15 minutes to get the next load in and then I&#39;ll
be able to have another 45 minutes of writing time.</p><p>More reading, should you need to, falls in two rather distinct camps: the domestic diva enthusiasm as seen on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#flylady">#flylady</a> , or the art and science of keeping home exemplified by <a href="http://google.com/search?q=cheryl+mendelson+home+comforts">Cheryl Mendelson&#39;s Home Comforts</a>.&#0160; Either way there&#39;s method in the madness, and I haven&#39;t even touched on the strategies of sending all of your wash out to be done, or taking it all to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Laundromats">laundromat</a> weekly for one big megawash. </p>

</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
No permit shall be issued to a person, by the City, and no chickens shall be allowed to be kept unless the owners of all residentially
zoned adjacent properties (see 9:42(3)(j)) consent in writing to the permit. Please attach the Adjacent Neighbor Consent Form to
this application and check the box that you understand and have complied with the terms of this ordinance requirement.<br />
 <br /></div><br /><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
If the requirements of Chapter 107 are not complied with, the City may revoke any permit granted and/or initiate prosecution for a
civil infraction violation. A person who has been issued a permit shall submit it for examination upon demand by any police officer or
code enforcement officer. Fenced enclosures are subject to all provisions of Chapter 104 (Fences). Notwithstanding the issuance of a
permit by the City, private restrictions on the use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit. Private
restrictions include but are not limited to deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws,
and covenant deeds. A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens
is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.repastspresentandfuture.org/123-people-eat-at-selma-cafe-and-king-of-calm-silvio-medoro-does-not-break-a-sweat/#respond">What happens if the man doesn&#39;t agree with your poultry easement</a>: you get a personal visit from the city attorney (!!!!!) who is apparently the city&#39;s only animal control officer.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We decided we were not interested in pursuing the official permit,
as we are a bit out of compliance anyway and do not really feel this
should be required (that this process is more just a way for the city
to ease into a common sense practice). The city attorney hand delivered
a notice telling us of all our waywardness. I will post a
notice/petition of support out front. Please come by and sign it when
you get a chance. Thanks!!</p><p>Read the <a href="http://www.chickenvideo.com/topten.html">Top Ten Reasons to Raise Your Own Yard Hens</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
