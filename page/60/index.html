<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>We haven&#39;t scheduled our visit yet to <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/">Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, MI</a>, but as a public service you should know that they are open.&#0160; From the mailing they sent out:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font color="#ff0000"><span class="il">STRAWBERRY</span> SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!!
</font></strong><br /><br />
The first day of the 2009 <span class="il">strawberry</span> season will be Wednesday June 3rd.
<br /><br />
As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&#0160;
ready to pick. If you are looking to pick massive amounts to freeze or
make jam it would be better to wait until they are more plentiful. With
the cool temperatures predicted the berries may not ripen that quickly.
It is advisable to call the farm before you come out to make sure we
are not closed to let them ripen up.
<br /><br />
The price of the berries is $1.46 per pound and we furnish the
containers for free.
<br /><br />
We are open 7 am to 8 pm daily (weather permitting).
<br /><br /></div><p>How did I find out about this, you ask?&#0160; &quot;The List&quot;</p><p class="UpickText blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We at Rowes have been compiling lists of customer
addresses over the years and been sending postcards to our customers
when the strawberry and raspberry seasons are at their peak. Our
strawberry list has over 12,000 addresses and the raspberry list has
over 4,500. Due to rising costs of printing and postage we are no
longer taking addresses for our lists. Instead we have started an email
list. You can sign up for &quot;The List&quot; by sending us an email via the <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/contact.html">Contact Us</a>
page. Once you send us an email the email address you send from will be
added to our new list. This way instead of getting one notice we are
able to send updated information on picking conditions more often,
better serving our customers. If you are on the &quot;old&quot; postcard list it
would be appreciated if you would sign up for the email list and tell
us your street address so we can remove it from the old list. </p><p>12000 strawberry pickers!&#0160; wow.&#0160; you should get on The List if you want more updates.&#0160; I didn&#39;t see any current info on their web site (other than &quot;get on The List&quot;).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.</p><p>Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in.&#0160; You are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat.&#0160; Each experience is essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less dingy, but it&#39;s all of a piece.</p><p>The result then is that I am transported into a new place with this effort, a place where I can write a postcard, read a long-forgotten book, or work within the confines&#0160;of my laptop without the infinite global distraction of the Internet.&#0160; Frankly, the infinite global distraction of the Internet is not conducive to reasonable thought - it demands attention, reply, responsiveness, and engagement, 24/7, whether you want it or not.</p><p>It&#39;s hard, but not impossible, to reconstruct airplane mode in the rest of the day.&#0160; The appropriate cafe can be a part of it, at least for the ritual coffee experience. It helps a lot to have a tool like Freedom (Mac OS X) that enforces a bit of network downtime for you by shutting down all Internet links for a period of time.&#0160; The telephone is&#0160;harder, but almost every call can be made to wait if you plan carefully enough to create a signal for what is actually urgent.</p><p>When I&#39;m offline, I write with different tools, and thus my thinking is different.&#0160; Entering text into &quot;vim&quot;, my old standby favorite text mode editor, triggers different brainwaves that does keying things carefully into a web form.&#0160; Not feeling like I have to hyperlink every third word frees up the brain for internal connections instead of external&#0160;connections.&#0160; There&#39;s rarely a need to hide from flashing distracting advertising or to spend time deleting spam.</p><p>Once upon a time, being online was the exception rather than the rule - some part of my far away brain remembers that and wants to get back to that earlier, simpler day.</p><p>--</p><p>notes afterwards.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/freedom-to-go-o.html">Freedom: previously described here.</a></p><p>a possible answer for using <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/06/use-notepad-vim-or-any-text-editor-with.html">vim as an alternative text editor in firefox</a></p><p>&quot;once upon a time&quot; is roughly the UUCP era, when there was email and netnews but no web and hardly ever any real time communications unless you were all logged into the same machine.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">So, standing in a bookshop with towers of cookery books inviting me on armchair culinary tours of just about everywhere, wondering what might come after Flavours of Southern Patagonia, my eye was drawn to a cover depicting rows of bright scarlet on a black background, that looked like an oil painting but turned out to be stalks of rhubarb. At first I thought they must be raw; no Sargasso sea of greenish-pink threads my mother used to overboil, and which - guided by Raymond Blanc - I can now cook intact. But not keep red.</div>

Keep the rhubarb and vanilla flavoured syrup and use to  glaze the rhubarb tarts or  as a base to make a delicious rhubarb and stem ginger sorbet. I also like to serve the vanilla sous-vide rhubarb cut in pieces for breakfast along with natural yoghurt, drizzle the vanilla rhubarb syrup over for that extra yumminess.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Which is why Chris Whaley, chef at Picco in Larkspur, vacuum-seals rhubarb in a heat-proof plastic bag with white wine-vanilla syrup, gently poaches it in a water bath, and spoons it atop individual almond tarts. At first bite, the rhubarb seems uncooked because it&#039;s so pleasingly crunchy. But it&#039;s not at all stringy or tough. It&#039;s just a whole new, delicious rhubarb.</div>

Drawing on the cuisines of England, Scotland, Scandinavia and other parts of northern Europe, America and New Zealand, she provides a rhubarbaric dish for every occasion. There is particular emphasis on recipes from Shetland, because the author spends half the year on the islands and rhubarb has a special place in Shetland’s cookery.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">It is said that, upon one occasion, an academic person met Mr. A. Edward Newton. Newton has written extensively on the subject of book-collecting, and, as any dealer will attest, has probably done more to increase the appreciation and the reading of English literature than many a professor or librarian. To Newton the academic announced, &quot;I am a scholar; to me a photostat is as good as the original.&quot; Newton swiftly countered, &quot;Any man who would make a remark like that, would probably just as soon kiss a pretty girl through a piece of plate glass.&quot; The librarian should be careful how he makes light of the collector&#039;s enthusiasm lest he reveal his own shortcomings.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">It won&#039;t be long before one of Southwest Michigan&#039;s largest crops starts making an appearance at area farmer&#039;s markets. MSU Extension District Fruit Educator Mark Longstroth says the region is one of the largest producers of strawberries in the state, and they&#039;re typically ripe for picking in mid June.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">So with only 5 months until we can harvest fresh rhubarb, we&#039;d better keep eating our canned and frozen rhubarb. I&#039;m going to be taking some of our canned stewed rhubarb to a Michigan Lady Food Bloggers &quot;Summer in January&quot; gathering where we are bringing food that reminds us of summer. However, there are many ways to use rhubarb in savory dishes. Here is a favorite of mine as it combines so many unusual flavors and healthy foods all in one dish! I took it to the last Slow Food book club. There was not much left over, but I was glad to see a little that I could take home to enjoy the next day.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">This is a delicious, unusual and quick brunch that I made for my friend Pat Smith visiting from Ann Arbor, MI. I like the balance between sweet, salt and tart tastes, as did Pat. French toast is something I knew in France as pain perdu or lost bread, I never had it for breakfast until I came to this country. There, it is always served as a dessert and mostly to use  up stale bread. My batter is pretty simple and the secret is in the bread: I use good french sourdough country bread. The duck bacon is of course from d’Artagnan, it’s slight gaminess reveals itself only after the pleasant tartness of the fresh rhubarb. There is no need for extra maple syrup as I sweeten the rhubarb compote with it.</div>

1 1/4 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and a scant 1/2 teaspoonful of salt, mixed together and stir the rhubarb into the mixture. Turn into lined plate, dot with bits of butter, and cover with pastry. Brush the lower edge of paste with water, before putting the upper crust in place, then press the edges together firmly, and brush over again with water. Bake
in a moderate oven until the pastry is well browned.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;The hothouse rhubarb industry prospered for decades. At one time root houses appeared on virtually every farm in Macomb County. The crop became so  important that in the late 1940s and early 1950s, an annual Rhubarb Festival was held in Utica, complete with a queen  and her court.  A headline in the Utica Sentinel in October 1953 proclaimed Utica the “Rhubarb Center of the World.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Here&#039;s my recipe for rhubarb pie. Make it with a lattice top, because for some reason, that is what rhubarb pies always have. If you are pie crust phobic, a lattice top is very forgiving. All you need to do is cut your top crust into slices, and lay a row of slices on top of your pie. My favorite trick is to lay the center cross lattice first, weaving over and under. Then place the outboard cross lattices from that center stripe, weaving them opposite of the one next to it.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Those who are self-conscious about using white crystal sugar can blend rhubarb with raisins, dates, prunes, honey, maple syrup, and even molasses. Consider other sour foods such as lemons, vinegar, sorrel, and sour cream. They make wonderful sweet and sour combinations: lemonade, chutneys, pickles, sweet and sour spareribs, Chinese hot and sour soup. Try substituting rhubarb, either raw, cooked, or as strained juice, in some of these dishes. Why not rhubarbade or rhubarb chutney?</div>

      <p>Herein a recipe for producing what looks like some kind of careful long term reasonable insight into a question, but what is really a coping strategy for the complete inability to be attentive to anything for very long.</p><p>Be distracted away from the thing you are supposed to be doing; that part is pretty easy.&#0160; Wander off randomly into the wilderness of recent changes to the Internet or a random page in your personal knowledge management heap or some long-dusty book in Google Books.&#0160; Note some small fragment of something that isn&#39;t at all relevant to what everyone else seems to be looking at right now but that somehow temporarily holds your interest long enough to compose a few paragraphs with a few links.&#0160; Write about it here; try with desperation to find a category it should already belong to so that it has some illusion of continuity with what you have been doing all along.&#0160; Hit &quot;save&quot;, hit &quot;publish&quot;, and return to the task at hand.</p><p>Scatter your attention all over the Internet to a range of places where recent changes seem to be more predominant.&#0160; Post to Twitter, or Facebook, or your favorite online newspaper&#39;s best reader comments section, or to some seasonally or topically appropriate blog where you know that the author welcomes your readership.&#0160; Be outwardly visible and pay attention to someone else, something else, some place other than yourself.&#0160; Make the rounds of the usual places and hit a few new ones.&#0160; Stop before everyone is asleep.</p><p>Gather up things you have written on a topic, things captured during previous distractions or scattered to the four winds.&#0160; If there is a search engine, search for your own long-forgotten commentary on something, and collect it back to somewhere central.&#0160; If all you have is paper, leaf through it steadily and methodically until inevitably that journal yields a relevant fragment.&#0160;&#0160; Pile up the fragments, enumerate them, list them out carefully as though they were bits of papyrus needing careful reassembly.&#0160; See what you might have known in the past and re-know it, relearn it.</p><p>Then, when all of the distract-scatter-gather process has all been put into motion, can you focus on that one thing you have been getting ready to do all this time.&#0160; Come back to what you have gathered up and re-assess the work as a whole.&#0160; Allow yourself to work methodically through the work you have gathered together, to pull it apart, to see what the whole set looks like and not just little bits of it.&#0160;&#0160; Pull through everything that is relevant and stitch it all together into something new, something that lasts longer than a simple short distraction but that hold and sustain a concentrated narrative with examples and ideas and themes and notions pulled out from a long time.</p><p>The whole process should run on some cycle appropriate for the task or the season.&#0160; As I write, I think about the quarterly holiday of Discardia, where you celebrate letting go, and of all of the distracted and scattered thinking I have about that event that culminates in an every three months deliberate effort to tidy things up.&#0160; The collected effort of pulling things together means not only that you have everything in mind but also that you can free yourself of the distractions that eventually got you here - and that you get, periodically, a chance to edit out some randomness and make it look like you are more organized and orderly than your easily-distracted nature would allow.</p><p>This season&#39;s Discardia holiday is coming up on June 20-22, 2009.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Today is a Twitter conference, so Twitter is full of good stuff people have been saving up.&#0160; Here&#39;s one: a &quot;conversation prism&quot; in bright happy colors showing a set of categories of tools, and how each one of them is occupied by some set of applications.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mapping of each of them onto the set of tools that I am using to keep a2b3 loosely connected.&#0160;
Sorry no links, didn&#39;t have time to hyperlink everything <a href="http://theconversationprism.com" title="The Conversation Prism by Brian Solis and Jesse Thomas"><img src="http://theconversationprism.com/convoprismembed.jpg" style="border: 0px solid #666666;" /></a></p><p>The Conversation Prism by <a href="http://briansolis.com">Brian Solis</a> and <a href="http://jess3.com">Jesse Thomas</a></p>
<br /><p><br />Forums: Yahoo Groups</p><p>This is the biggest single tool I use for group continuity; it perhaps reflects my elderly nature that email is the first system rather than web-based forums or modern social networks.&#0160; All I can say in my defense is that Usenet would have been better but it&#39;s really not available, and that I have 10 years of continuous use into Yahoo Groups and they haven&#39;t ruined it (yet).</p><p>Social networks: Facebook (intermittently)</p><p>Facebook will show up here frequently, if only because it&#39;s ubiquitous and because Ann Arbor is full of people who use it.&#0160; My sense is that its group tools are way weaker than its personal tools and so it&#39;s best used as an adjunct to the main Yahoo group just so you can attach names to faces and so you can promote events.</p><p>&quot;Interest and curated networks&quot; (?): LinkedIn</p><p>I&#39;m not sure about the category, but LinkedIn certainly qualifies as one ongoing conversation starting and continuing tool.&#0160; Like Facebook, groups are second class objects in LinkedIn, and thus it&#39;s weak at building cohesion.&#0160; On the plus side you don&#39;t have to pretend to be someone&#39;s pal to look up their resume.</p><p>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</p><p>There are a bunch of national scale review sites, but nothing beats asking a good sized group of your peers for recommendations on everything from programming language libraries to pest control.&#0160; To whatever extent possible, Arborwiki becomes the public long term storage for what would otherwise be something ephemeral and hard to retrieve through the Yahoo Groups search interface.</p><p>Location: none; I gave up on Plaxo when it creeped me out</p><p>Location-based mobile services are supposed to be the future of the social mobile web, but I lived through having my location visible on Plaxo and decided against living that way when people who knew where I was without me telling them didn&#39;t have the social clues not to be obvious that they were watching me.&#0160;&#0160; If I want to tell you where I am I&#39;ll be explicit about it on Twitter, or you can just wonder.</p><p>Video: whatever people use</p><p>There are a couple of filmmakers in the group, and I respect their judgement what to use for video.&#0160; None of the video tools have strong group membership characteristics - or even particularly weak ones - so I treat them all pretty much interchangably as dumb hosting.&#0160; (And no, I don&#39;t particular care if any given short video clip goes viral.)</p><p>Customer Service: Get Satisfaction, but it&#39;s not quite right</p><p>If a2b3 was a business it might need customer support, but it&#39;s not, and Get Satisfaction is just extra baggage.&#0160; Tried it, it seemed to be functional, but not for the problem at hand.</p><p>Documents/Content: SlideShare seems to be a favorite</p><p>Those people who are giving presentations seem to have settled on SlideShare as a common denominator for hosting.&#0160; The weekly lunches don&#39;t feature presentations so there&#39;s no natural synchronization around it as a tool, but it works as advertised.</p><p>Events: upcoming, Facebook events, in-person lunch w/announcements</p><p>Events are perhaps the hardest nut to crack, the thing that would make you spend all week promoting other people&#39;s work and the like.&#0160; I have been telling people who don&#39;t have URLs for events to post them to upcoming; Facebook will tell you about more parties than you can manage to go to; and there&#39;s nothing like someone telling you about something around the table.&#0160; The only way to really lick the events question is to have someone full time collecting them.</p><p>Music: One each of everything; I&#39;m fond of how blip.fm twitters out songs</p><p>blip.fm is the closest thing to Napster that&#39;s out there; do a Twitter search for your favorite artist plus the word &quot;blip&quot; and you may be lucky enough to find a fellow fan and a track you can listen to.&#0160;&#0160; YouTube is also really good for songs - my 4 y/o calls it &quot;picture music&quot;.</p><p>Wiki: Arborwiki, plus my own private Socialtext space</p><p>Arborwiki is the designated spot for dropping in information that deserves to live in a wiki; the &quot;Birthday Deals&quot; page there is the one universal attraction point around which much of the rest lives.&#0160; I keep a Socialtext private wiki for my own personal memory augmentation tool, in part because it works awesomely on my Blackberry.</p><p>Livecasting video: haven&#39;t done it yet, not appropriate for lunch</p><p>If you want to join in to lunch, you don&#39;t want to watch it remotely; the space isn&#39;t set up for that.&#0160; If and when I get to a place where regular live video streaming makes sense I&#39;ll use whatever the cool kids are using then.</p><p>Pictures: Flickr, Facebook photos</p><p>Once upon a time Flickr was a dynamic photo community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly creative people who you really wanted to share pictures with.&#0160; Then everything grew up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and my camera died.&#0160; Now if I want to share a photo I&#39;m more likely to put it on Facebook.&#0160; I miss the old Flickr.</p><p>Social bookmarks: Delicious, plus whatever Les is working on</p><p>Once upon a time Delicious was a dynamic bookmark community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly smart people who you really wanted to share bookmarks with.&#0160; Then everything group up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and Twitter came along.&#0160; Now if I want to share a link I think twice and either twitter it out or work it into a longer blog post.&#0160; I just hope my 10,000 bookmarks stick around for a long time.</p><p>Comment and reputation: plenty of that around the lunch table</p><p>There&#39;s enough people who I care to converse with that I know by face and name that the level of comment-tracking promoted by blog tools seems irrelevant, for the most part, or at least too much work.</p><p>Crowdsourced content: arborwiki, a2geeks</p><p>Both arborwiki and a2geeks have enough of a wiki platform running for general and for technical info that if you need to crowdsource something there&#39;s a place to point people toward to edit things.</p><p>Collaboration: Google Spreadsheets (for football parking info)</p><p>If I need to collect a bunch of numbers from a bunch of people, Google Spreadsheets seems to do pretty well.&#0160; I love wiki for private collaboration, but you have to be collaborating with people who love it too.&#0160; Otherwise, printing things out and letting someone else wrestle with tracking changes in Microsoft Word is about as good as I get.</p><p>Blog platforms: Typepad</p><p>Someone else worries about it and I just hit &quot;post&quot;.</p><p>Blogs/conversations: Google Blog Search is the best of a bad lot</p><p>It&#39;s hard to track conversations in blogs, in part because the blog vs comment distinction is weird.&#0160; It&#39;s just as easy to do regular Google searches and put in teh word &quot;blog&quot; as an added qualifier.</p><p>Blog communities: mybloglog</p><p>I&#39;m using this mostly for stats and to detect one-day spikes that mean that some seasonal post is current again or to notice when something is on fire.</p><p>Micromedia: Twitter</p><p>twitter, duh.&#0160; </p><p>Twitter ecosystems: trying out Cotweet</p><p>I have a beta account; it&#39;s working pretty well to do future scheduled postings and to better track responses.&#0160; Not sure yet if and how to open up the @a2b3 account to multiple posters but that&#39;s the next obvious thing.</p><p>SMS/Voice: Google Voice</p><p>It converts voice mail to text so that I don&#39;t have to listen to all of my voice mail.&#0160; Still in closed beta.</p><p>Lifestreams: get a life!&#0160; need some privacy sometime</p><p>Part of living a life is deciding what to broadcast to the Internet and what to keep quiet.&#0160; I&#39;m just as happy to be offline as online, and the idea that you should soulcast every last mood swing seems to be as unproductive as it gets</p><p>----</p><p>After working my way through this, I realize what it&#39;s missing - all of these apps I write about are apps that work on a big screen.&#0160; The real conversation prism also includes a parallel set of augmented reality supported by mobile devices, and that very well may include entirely new categories than above.</p>

      <p>The Capital Press is an agricultural journal for the Western US.&#0160; I search it from time to time to get blueberry crop information.&#0160; Here&#39;s a latest <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/main.asp?SectionID=67&amp;SubSectionID=619&amp;ArticleID=51520&amp;TM=84492.1"><strong>Oregon blueberry assessment cap altered downward</strong></a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="mailto:mlies@capitalpress.com"><span color="#000000" size="1;" style="font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF"><strong>Mitch Lies</strong></span></a><br /><span color="#000000" size="1;" style="font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF"><strong>Capital Press</strong></span><br /><br /><font color="#000000" face="ARIAL, SANS SERIF" size="2">SALEM

blueberry assessments.</font><br /><br /><span color="#000000" size="2;" style="font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF">Oregon blueberry growers, beginning this summer, will pay no more than 1 percent of the value of their crop in assessments.</span><br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.oregonblueberry.com/farms.html">A list of Oregon blueberry farms</a> is useful if you are in the area during the fresh berry season.</p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/04/south_american_bumper_crop_of.html">An April 2009 story from the Grand Rapids Press</a> points to a continuing growth in frozen blueberries in storage, in part due to growth of crops in South America.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">About 150 million tons of blueberries are now in storage nationwide,
said Carlos Garcia Salazar, a small fruit specialist for <a href="http://web1.msue.msu.edu/fruit/bluberry.htm">Michigan State
Extension Service</a>&#39;s Ottawa County office. That&#39;s about double the
normal amount for this time of year.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="more"></a></div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Fresh blueberry prices were above $2 per pound in
2007 and 2008, but this year they will be closer to $1.30 a pound. A
pound of processed blueberries could drop from $1.63 to below $1.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We had bonanza for three or four years,&quot; Salazar said. &quot;But that&#39;s over.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We believe that given our holdings and storage some are estimating prices similar to five or six years ago.&quot;</p><p>One possible direction for this surplus of blueberries is increased use as a dried fruit, in addition to fresh and frozen.&#0160; <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/05/graceland_fruit_is_a_dried_and.html">The Kalamazoo Gazette writes about Graceland Fruit</a>, which has innovated in creating cherry and blueberry &quot;raisins&quot;</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We&#39;re starting to see a very significant increase in dried
blueberries,&quot; said Frank Bragg, chief executive of <a href="http://www.blueberries.com/">MBG Marketing</a>, a
multi-state blueberry cooperative based in Grand Junction, near South
Haven.</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Today, 10 to 15 percent of processed blueberries are dried. That&#39;s up from about 5 percent two years ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">A quarter of North America&#39;s blueberry crop comes from a four-county
stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline between Grand Haven and the Indiana
border.</p><p>In other news, we had blueberry pancakes for breakfast (yum).</p>

      <p>Here&#39;s a thought experiment for you.&#0160; (See what people are saying: google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vielmetti+mobile+identity">mobile identity</a> , twitter search <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=mobile+identity">mobile identity</a> )</p><p>You&#39;re waiting to meet someone who you don&#39;t know very well, and you have a few minutes with your cell phone to do a little bit of searching or browsing to see what might be useful to know.&#0160; If you have one social mobile site to look at, which would it be?&#0160; And when the meeting is over, where do you jot down that note to self to remind you for the next visit?</p><p>Some possibilities:</p><p><a href="http://m.facebook.com">Mobile facebook.</a>&#0160; If you&#39;re frends already, this works pretty well, as long as your correspondent is keeping up appearances.&#0160; This is pretty much an all or nothing question.</p><p>Mobile Google search.&#0160; This works pretty well if the person you&#39;re talking to has a distinguished name, but not everyone does.&#0160; The results are an absolute mixed bag and vary wildly depending on how much personal SEO someone does and how lucky you are with Google mobile-izing the results.</p><p><a href="http://m.linkedin.com">Mobile LinkedIn</a>.&#0160; Dry as dust, this won&#39;t even get you someone&#39;s picture so that you know you have the right person; suitable for background employment history, so I guess if you&#39;re doing impromptu interviews it might be a good part of your mobile arsenal.</p><p><a href="http://m.twitter.com">Mobile Twitter.</a>&#0160; That person you&#39;re about to meet, did they have a peanut butter sandwich for dinner last night, so you can avoid suggesting one again?&#0160; This is perhaps the most open ended resource to tap into if someone is on Twitter, since it&#39;s plausible to believe that you might be able to get a message through that they&#39;d see.</p><p>Mobile Gmail search.&#0160; If you have had a bunch of correspondence with someone and you use Gmail, one plausible tactic is simply to plow through your old inbox and unearth some conversation from the past to bring up again.&#0160; Results may vary but it&#39;s a much more personal search than any of the others.</p><p>Mobile Flickr.&#0160; Is your friend a photographer?&#0160; Look at their photo stream, it&#39;s like a personal channel into their life.&#0160; This only works if you know there&#39;s photos to see.</p><p>Mobile wiki.&#0160; If you, like me, are one of the odd people who keeps a personal wiki, then you can search through it and see if there&#39;s some wiki note-to-self that you wrote that triggers a memory or association.&#0160; There&#39;s a variety of similar memory augmentation tools that fill a niche that was once called a &quot;personal information manager&quot;, and the right ones of these offer a jumping off point for reflection or memory or jotting down a few notes.</p><p>Mobile address book.&#0160; If your address book on your mobile phone or web-based call manager has a notes field, you might have written down a few things or a lot of things that you want to remember for that next conversation.&#0160; Most of these that I&#39;ve seen are pathetic fixed-length field plain text databases with no inter-contact linking and very weak group management, but you might have worked around something&#39;s limitations to make it your own.</p><p>The overall complaint I have about all of these is that nothing does an awesome job of being the everything-spot to look up a few notes before an impromptu meeting and to jot down a few notes afterwards.&#0160;&#0160; As a rule, the web-based stuff is weak on being a launching point for phone calls, the phone-based stuff is weak on web services, and the social networks aren&#39;t private enough.&#0160; At some point you just want to carry around a little black address book and write things discreetly in pencil.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On Thursday May 22 I had lunch with the a2b3 group for the 183d time.&#0160; I&#39;m writing that down as though it was a perfectly accurate number, just so that next week I can look it up and say that it will be the 184th time.</p><p>Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.&#0160; This week it felt like Groundhog Day, where I was the Bill Murray character practicing piano lessons over and over again until I really was the person who was good at hosting lunch for 30 instead of someone wondering whether I could pull off hosting lunch more than once.</p><p>It was a quiet week in Ann Arbor, my home town, where Garrison Keillor comes to do his Prairie Home Companion every once in a while at lovely Hill Auditorium, though he didn&#39;t come this week and won&#39;t come next week but he might show up at any moment, making you think that he was just a voice from the radio even though you could see him on stage.&#0160; Ann Arbor is still the third or fourth best city in the nation for any number of things that you could measure, and if anyone wants to put together the convincing statistic that ranks this town in the best in the nation for bi bim bap I am certain that our civic leaders can devise the numerator and demoninator for the metric that proves it.&#0160; And we&#39;re justly proud of our long civic history of providing parking structures for all of the cars of all of the vistors who come to our charming town to experience its pedestrian charms.</p><p>Every week, after I give a short speech, I ask a question.&#0160; Some of them are great questions, and some of them are ordinary questions, and mostly they give the lunch patron a chance to say something about themselves that doesn&#39;t depend on the &quot;what do you do for a living&quot; answer because when you are free for lunch sometimes that is because you are in a career transition and your sense of personal identity that used to be wrapped up in your job is cut adrift.&#0160; No one needs to be put on the spot that way, so the lunch question admits a certain ambiguity about your day job.</p><p>People introduce themselves, say a few words, and hand the microphone on.&#0160; We started using a microphone because the table seats 35 and it&#39;s the entire length of the restaurant.&#0160; The people who come back again and again sometimes get good at describing who they are in a few words that can be repeated faithfully by anyone else who is similarly a regular.&#0160; The question is almost always optional, and people are always free to ask their own question or to ask for assistance from the group from some problem, thorny and pressing or trivial and mundane; generally the specific answers wait until afterwards when people talk among themselves again.</p><p>I try to introduce the whole table by 1 pm so people can move to the next thing they need to do.&#0160; It has been a remarkable crowd for many reasons, not the least of which is the wide variety in ages of the people at the table, ranging this week from just out of high school to nearly retired.&#0160; It&#39;s a special design of no specific purpose that you need to get a diverse crowd - by not having a clear cut agenda, you make it possible to let pretty much any person who shows up be the right person to arrive.</p><p>At the end there is some attempt to organize information about upcoming events, either meetings of other groups that organize regularly, or one time events that someone is planning.&#0160; </p><p>With the routine as established as it is, and with enough people knowing what to expect and how to work within the time boundaries that are the only real fixed limits, it&#39;s been possible for me not to show up and not to announce that the event is happening and have everything go pretty much the same as if I were there.&#0160; </p>

<p>As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&nbsp; It's not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there's a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.</p>

<p>When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.&nbsp; I'm hoping to collect some of that same level of detail here.&nbsp; It's always a big concern when forests burn, especially when they burn uncontrolled in land that doesn't have a lot of roads in it.</p>

<p>Here's some details I've been able to figure out so far.</p>

<p>The Yooper Daily blog from Shawn and Brian Malone, commercial photographers, has a post titled simply <a href="http://yooperdaily.blogspot.com/2009/05/wildfires-break-out-in-up.html">Wildfires Break Out In UP.</a> They have an approximate map of the Black River Falls fire which shows it deep in the woods of Ely Township. </p>

<p>A lot of my searches go to another fire called the <a href="http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3321">Black River Falls fire, but in Jackson County Wisconsin;</a> this historical marker describes a 1977 fire, the traces of which are almost gone by now with timber regrowth.</p>

<p>The Remote Sensing Applications Center of the USDA Forest Service has a series of maps, including this <a href="http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/activefiremaps.php?op=maps&rCode=enm">Northern Midwest fire map</a> (Northern Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin).&nbsp; The current one I'm looking at shows the Pinery Fire near L'Anse, MI, but nothing from the Black River Falls fire. The scale on this is fairly large, so it doesn't pin down the precise acreage, just the nearest town.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img  src="file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="">For a more detailed map you turn to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr">Michigan DNR</a>, which is preparing maps for active fire fighting. This sample shows the extent of the fire as of last update, though it doesn't have a date on the map, the file date is 20090521 (may 21, 2009).&nbsp; <a style="display: inline;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-pi"><img  class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b image-full " alt="Picture 2" title="Picture 2" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-800wi" border="0"></a> 
</p>

<p><br><p>I&rsquo;m stopping here because this is what I started looking for, and you&rsquo;ll want to stay tuned to whatever other news sources you have if you&rsquo;re close to the fire.</p></p>

<p>On twitter I notice updates from <a href="http://twitter.com/MDNR">@MDNR</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wluctv6">@wluctv6</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/miningjournal">@miningjournal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nortman">@nortman</a> and expect to collect more.&nbsp; It's worth noting that the Mining Journal has extremely terse 60 character headlines on Twitter which means that typical keyword style searches don't find them very well, though once you do find their news stream the writing and reporting is first rate, and they have <a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/527617.html">interviews of people at the Red Cross shelter at Westwood High School</a> which is quite evidently information central for families affected by the blaze. </p>

<blockquote>
ISHPEMING - Sandwiches, coffee, donuts, cots to sleep on - the American Red Cross shelter, set up at the Westwood High School gym, was ready to fill the needs of residents evacuated due to the Black River Falls fire off Marquette County Road 581.

The thing the evacuees were wanting most, however, was news about the fire.

Of the 300 people who passed through the shelter Wednesday, the vast majority wanted news about their homes and neighbors, said Red Cross Executive Director Kayla West.

"They wanted information more than anything," she said.

      </h3>
      <p>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&#39;re better than me.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.westsidefarmersmarket.com/">Westside Farmers Market</a>, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&#0160; </p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ann Arbor&#39;s Westside Farmers&#39; Market is currently &quot;on hold&quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor.</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/zoning_violation_shuts_down_an.html">The Ann Arbor News story by Judy McGovern reads</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The property&#39;s C3 zoning is the most relaxed of the three commercial categories, but it doesn&#39;t allow the kind of &quot;special use&quot; permits that can be issued to properties in the more restrictive C1 and C2 categories.<br /><br />That appears to be an oversight in the regulations, and city officials are working to change the code, said City Council Member Carsten Hohnke, whose 5th Ward includes the property.<br /><br /></div><p>I read through <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Ordinances/Pages/Online%20City%20Code.aspx">city code</a>; it appears that C3 zoning (5:10.23) for the properly in question is preferential to properties where automotive access is the characteristic function:</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="blockquote l0" style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">Intent.</span>&#0160;
            <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline;">The
design and regulations of this district are set up to provide for
certain types of commercial activities which have characteristics in
common. In this district, the customer usually comes directly to the
particular establishment by automobile, making a separate stop for each
errand. Comparison shopping activity is less than in the central
business district. Since there is little essential interdependence of
activities, establishments can be dispersed over considerable areas
with each establishment having its own automobile parking. Good
automobile accessibility is essential to these districts. The uses
permitted, because of their lack of intense pedestrian activity and
their required contact with auto access, would be incompatible in the
central business district.</span>&#0160;
            </div>
</div><p><br />The get-out-of-jail-free card is this language on special use permits, as described in the C-1 Local Business District language (5.10.15):</p><div class="Normal-Level">
<div class="l1 blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">(h)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;The City Council may, by resolution, designate
certain dates and locations as special events temporary outdoor sales
areas. Said resolution shall include conditions and standards of
conduct to be in force for outdoor sales and displays on private
property. A property owner who wishes to conduct outdoor sales and
displays on his or her private property, as provided for in the council
resolution, shall first apply for and receive a Zoning Compliance
Permit by the date designated in the resolution. The conditions and
standards contained in the resolution shall be conditions of the Zoning
Compliance Permit issued to a property owner. Failure to comply with
the conditions set in the resolution shall be a violation of this
ordinance section and shall be grounds to revoke all permits granted to
the property owner for the duration of the special event identified in
the resolution.</div>
</div><p><br />The question, is appears, is whether the C-1 &quot;special events&quot; language applies to C-3 zoning, or whether there is no permit possible for someone in the automotive, big box, strip mall and huge parking lot district to ever do a temporary outdoor sales area.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>Given that Zingerman&#39;s had a previous permit for this use I suspect there&#39;s some other story not yet being told.&#0160; Your guess is as good as mine what prompted this whole snafu.&#0160; <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/04/development_dirt_dda_drug_stor.html">Zingerman&#39;s has had disputes with the city about their 322 E Kingsley property&#39;s zoning</a> , which have come to council recently.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-crisis-informatics-or-the-study-of-community-emergency-response/">crisis informatics, or the study of community emergency response</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The &quot;<a href="http://google.com/search?q=crisis+informatics">crisis informatics</a>&quot; (Google search) term is new to me, but the research I&#39;ve been able to find under that term is familiar.&#0160; Faced with an unexpected crisis situation that is bigger than what the mainstream media and existing government organizations can easily manage the news flow from, how do communities response in emergency situations with social media and with ad hoc emergency response systems?</p>
<p>Without going into lots of detail I do want to share one recent paper that caught my eye, via Leysia Palen: <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/%7Epalen/Papers/iscram08/BackchannelsISCRAM08.pdf">Backchannels on the Front Lines: Emergent Uses of Social Media in the 2007 Southern California Wildfires.</a></p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Opportunities for participation by members of the public are expanding the information arena of disaster.&#0160; Social media supports “backchannel” communications, allowing for wide-scale interaction that can be collectively resourceful, self-policing, and generative of information that is otherwise hard to obtain. Results from our study of information practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires suggest that community information resources and other backchannel communications activity enabled by social media are gaining prominence in the disaster arena, despite concern by officials about the legitimacy of information shared through such means. We argue that these emergent uses of social media are pre-cursors of broader future changes to the institutional and organizational arrangements of disaster response. </div>
<p><br />The term &quot;crisis informatics&quot; is credited to Christine Hagar (2006).&#0160; If you do a proper retrospective look at the phenomenon without that term, you unearth previous discussion of the use of the net for responses in the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes, hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and various power outages and ice storms.&#0160; A proper retrospective bibliography awaits someone else&#39;s project.</p>

      <p>Bumboats are small boats used as floating shops that market to sailors in harbor.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a tradition of them on the Great Lakes; here&rsquo;s what I could find with a bit of searching.<br><br>In Duluth, Minnesota, <a href="http://www.duluthport.com/99wintspr/marinetrader.html">the Marine Trader went back to the lakes in 1998</a>:&nbsp; (via a story in Minnesota&rsquo;s World Port w/photos)<br><span  style="font-family: Arial" size="3;"><br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">On May 24, 1998, an
 old boat and an even older maritime practice both came back to life. Here’s what
 happened, as described by Franz VonRiedel: &ldquo;After 12 years of lying idle, the
 bumboat Marine Trader pulled up along-side the 650-foot self-unloader Algoway at the
 Cutler-Magner salt dock in Duluth. Up went the ladders, and the crew members of the
 Algoway scrambled down to do a little shopping … &ldquo; </font></div></p>

<p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Franz VonRiedel wrote those words as part of an
 article for a recent edition of the Nor’easter, the journal of the Lake Superior
 Marine Museum Association. Mr. VonRiedel knows bumboats, and he really knows the Marine
 Trader. He and his father, Bruce VonRiedel, own the Trader and three other small craft
 that make up their business, Acme Marine Services. </font></p>Some other bumboats on the lakes included the <a href="http://archive.boatnerd.com/archiveg/11-04/000121e4.htm">Dewey&rsquo;s and Kessler II in Toledo</a> (now scrapped), and something similar but not quite the same is the <a href="http://www.boatnerd.com/westcott/mbtnnw.htm">mail boat J.

      </h3>
      <p>I put up a little project on github last night, <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter mutual friends</a>.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.</p><p>I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</p><p>The existing Twitter feedback for these is very limited, based almost entirely on numerical counts.&#0160; I thought I could do better by examining what kind of mutual relationships already existed between me and other people and to see if I could characterize folks based on who else they followed to know at least which part of my life they might have found me by.</p><p>Thus, the twitter mutual friends effort.&#0160; The simplest version of this downloads two friend lists, and looks for overlap.&#0160; The list of overlapping ids is walked through, noting who the overlapping people are, what their last twitter was, how many people they in turn were following, and the like.&#0160; </p><p>You could look either at friends, followers, or mutual friend/follow pairs; you can derive things from the text of recent tweets from mutual friends, or their follow counts, or other second derivatives of mutuality or reciprocity.&#0160; At some point there&#39;s a nice visual of all of this, as well as some good textual analysis (&quot;trending words in our mutual followers&quot;).&#0160; But as a start this is just an effort to get beyond simple counting and into network views of twitter.</p>
