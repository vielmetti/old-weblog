There is a new book out on the disaster, entitled Bath Massacre: America's First School Bombing, from the University of Michigan Press, written by Arnie Bernstein.&nbsp; The press kindly sent me a copy.&nbsp; Bernstein has a historian's eye for small and significant period details of fascinating interest to anyone who thinks about what the 1920s were like in Michigan, which makes it easy to pick up anywhere and read some small detail that gives you a sense for the times. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-in-memory-of-the-victims-of-the-bath-massacre-may-18-1927/">&raquo;</a></p>

1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy.
2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-15-blog-more-twitter-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I put up a little project on github last night, twitter mutual friends.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.
I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-12-twitter-mutual-friends-exploring-mutual-and-reciprocal-relationships/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.
As a small public service, the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-08-jesusita-fire-in-santa-barbara-ca-in-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Let me explain to you why those terms don&#39;t explain things very well.
I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-07-i-am-not-an-information-activist-or-a-civic-minded-data-freak-thank-you-very-much/">&raquo;</a></p>

1.&#0160; Move all starred items to the inbox

The fascinating thing from a technical point of view is just how many of these board packets include spreadsheets, and how many of the spreadsheets are presented either as bitmapped images or as text-only documents. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-04-that-image-of-the-spreadsheet-in-the-pdf-you-sent-me-is-not-the-public-record-you-are-required-to-sh/">&raquo;</a></p>
