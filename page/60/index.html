        <p>On Thursday May 22 I had lunch with the a2b3 group for the 183d time.&#0160; I&#39;m writing that down as though it was a perfectly accurate number, just so that next week I can look it up and say that it will be the 184th time. Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.&#0160; This week it felt like Groundhog Day, where I was the Bill Murray character practicing piano lessons over and over again until I really was the person who was good at hosting lunch for 30 instead of someone wondering whether I could pull off hosting lunch more than once. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-22-a2b3-nonsummary-for-22-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Google search: black river falls michigan fire map Twitter search: black river falls As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&nbsp; It's not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there's a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire. When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.&nbsp; I'm hoping to collect some of that same level of detail here.&nbsp; It's always a big concern when forests burn, especially when they burn uncontrolled in land that doesn't have a lot of roads in it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-21-black-river-falls-fire-maps/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&#39;re better than me. The Westside Farmers Market, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&#0160; Ann Arbor&#39;s Westside Farmers&#39; Market is currently &quot;on hold&quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor. The Ann Arbor News story by Judy McGovern reads The property&#39;s C3 zoning is the most relaxed of the three commercial categories, but it doesn&#39;t allow the kind of &quot;special use&quot; permits that can be issued to properties in the more restrictive C1 and C2 categories. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-ann-arbor-westside-farmers-market-on-hold-due-to-zoning-restrictions/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On May 18, 1927, disgruntled school board member Andrew Kehoe bombed the Bath, Michigan school, killing 38 children and six adults. There is a new book out on the disaster, entitled Bath Massacre: America's First School Bombing, from the University of Michigan Press, written by Arnie Bernstein.&nbsp; The press kindly sent me a copy.&nbsp; Bernstein has a historian's eye for small and significant period details of fascinating interest to anyone who thinks about what the 1920s were like in Michigan, which makes it easy to pick up anywhere and read some small detail that gives you a sense for the times.&nbsp; There is enough of a horrifying tragedy in these covers, a story that I don't know, that I think I need to get the book onto a high shelf so that my very literate 8 year old doesn't read it quite just yet until I get a chance to read it and figure out how to explain it to him. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-in-memory-of-the-victims-of-the-bath-massacre-may-18-1927/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords. As a small public service, the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again.&#0160; His piece on how the media need to do better reporting on wildfires is spot on: With all due respect to the good jobs that most of the legacy media are doing, their coverage could be much, much better if they paid respect to those listening and watching online, which includes their smart phones. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-08-jesusita-fire-in-santa-barbara-ca-in-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Let me explain to you why those terms don&#39;t explain things very well. I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-07-i-am-not-an-information-activist-or-a-civic-minded-data-freak-thank-you-very-much/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m always behind on email, but this time it&#39;s worse than normal.&#0160; Here&#39;s a catching up strategy.&#0160; To do this you need to know that anything I think might need a response gets a star in Gmail, but sometimes also gets archived for later. 1.&#0160; Move all starred items to the inbox 2.&#0160; Mark all inbox items as new 3.&#0160; Marvel that there are 238 things to read that haven&#39;t been touched 4.&#0160; Lean on the j key to zoom through them quickly 5.&#0160; Count only the number that hasn&#39;t been looked at at least once I&#39;m also using tags in Gmail, so an additional strategy is to select all the messages, look in the labels tab, see which labels look weird, unselect everything, and then search just for the label you found (to deal with it or delete it). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-06-making-sure-everything-that-needs-to-be-read-gets-read-at-least-once/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;ve become one of those people who requests and then reads the &quot;board packets&quot; for meetings of public bodies.&#0160; These are fascinating things, generally 50-150 page tomes of memos, spreadsheets, graphs, charts, and news clippings that the staff of a public body will prepare for its board to go into a public meeting. The fascinating thing from a technical point of view is just how many of these board packets include spreadsheets, and how many of the spreadsheets are presented either as bitmapped images or as text-only documents.&#0160; In either case, there&#39;s no way to know how the spreadsheet is constructed, whether the totals presented really add up to the totals displayed, and what if anything is hidden in the model used to come up with the numbers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-04-that-image-of-the-spreadsheet-in-the-pdf-you-sent-me-is-not-the-public-record-you-are-required-to-sh/">&raquo;</a></p>
