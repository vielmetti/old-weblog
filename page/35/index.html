        <p>I&#39;m irritated when so-called newspapers fill their pages by rewriting stories from other newspapers. It&#39;s worst when the rewrite is as long as the original and contains no new reporting, just regurgitage.
A typical example:
Dexter Patch writes a story about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station. AnnArbor.com follows up with the same story, too lazy even to call any of the officials named in the story to get its own quote. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-05-rewritten-news-blah/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A France-based school of writing called &quot;Oulipo&quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is an entire novel written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format.  A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-01-a-salute-to-oulipo-providing-inspiration-since-my-keyboard-is-missing-a-key-and-i-wonder-if-anyone-w/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>750 words on blogging, memory and forgetting
I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-28-750-words-on-blogging-memory-and-forgetting-ive-been-blogging-for-a-long-time-and-writing-online-for-longer-than-that-27/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private Facebook forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-27-ubiquity-focus-and-isolation-as-success-factors-for-internet-socialiability/">&raquo;</a></p>

I&rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&rsquo;t have much to compare against. The experience so far recommends it as a handy adjunct to a full-size computer for some tasks, and it makes me more confident in my hunch that an Android phone is going to be my next phone. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-23-the-d2-pad-a-short-review-of-an-android-tablet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.
The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.
Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-23-librarything-as-a-shadow-catalog-for-books/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-22-my-goal-sitting-down-to-write-this-is-to-write-a-thousand-words-exhorting-you-to-occasionally-sit-down-and-write-long-about/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means.
The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-20-task-surfing-which-is-to-say-not-multitasking-with-github/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Students and teachers from the photography class at Marquette Alternative High School (MAHS) create a calendar each year. The project showcases their work and funds a field trip for the students. This year&#39;s 2013 calendar features pictures of Marquette, the butterfly house on Mackinac Island, and the DeYoung Family Zoo in Wallace. The cost is $20 and it&#39;s available for sale online.
Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&#39;s trip. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-17-marquette-alternative-high-school-photo-calendar-for-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>
