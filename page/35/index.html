<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking to localwiki</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages</li>

Google's Street View has come to Ann Arbor.  From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon.  The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi's toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.<br />

Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.  With the exception of a short foray through the private drive in Barton Hills, nothing outside the freeway limits was explored.  No Ypsi, no Chelsea, not even the bits of Ann Arbor on the wrong side of the concrete walls.<br />

      <p>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form.  Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.</p>

<p>The single best blog on the topic is <a href="http://daveslandslideblog.blogspot.com/">Dave's Landslide Blog</a>, from Dave Petley, who is the Wilson Professor at Durham University, UK.  He's doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won't even try to be up to date with that.</p>

<p>As a previous example:</p>

<p>Lake Sarez in Tajikistan is the result of a 1911 earthquake, forming the 600 meter long Usoi landslide dam.  An <a href="http://eeg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/151">article in GeoScienceWorld by Schuster and Alford</a> discusses the risks of the dam failing.  A <a href="http://www.adrc.or.jp/countryreport/TJK/2003/page4.html">2003 risk mitigation project</a> installed remote warning sensors to alert villagers of risks detected.</p>

<p>Quake Lake in Montana formed after a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1959_08_18.php">1959 earthquake</a>; the <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/magazine/990815_mag01.html">Billings Gazette</a> captured memories of it in 1999.  The US Army Corps of Engineers was quickly put into service to build a spillway for the dam.</p>

<p>There is a limestone pier  <br />
That stretches into blue  <br />
Waves on Lake Superior <br />
   <br />
Where I cast a spoon into  <br />
Water glowing translucent green  <br />
Like sunlight through a leaf <br />
  <br />
And watch a lone fishing boat  <br />
Surrounded by circling gulls  <br />
That cry a plaintive call <br />
  <br />
Make its way from the blue waves  <br />
Toward the calm green water  <br />
Behind the seawall of the harbor  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>In the "try this next year" category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down.  Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there's frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don't have soil.</p>

<p>Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty.</p>

<p>There's apparently television advertising for these things (which tells you how much TV I watch) but these look pretty easy.</p>

<p>without further ado:</p>

<p>from <a href="http://greenthumbs.tribe.net/thread/5ea48cbb-5b2c-4320-8b70-e0e068cc58a9">greenthumbs.tribe.net :</a><br />
<blockquote><br />
My 83 year old dad told me he use to grow upside down tomatoes in an old tin, they would put a small hole in the end of the tin (I guess a paint tin? not sure what type tin they used) and plant the tomato plant upside down and at the top of the tin they would plant a pepper plant. He said they flourished! I have the upside down container that I am going to plant my tomatoes and herbs in this spring...I can't wait!<br />
</blockquote></p>

<blockquote><br />
I had great success with tomato plants, but peppers did poorly. I drilled a single hole and fed my seedlings up through the bottom. This year I am making the hole a little bigger and putting the plant through the inside of the bucket and using some landscape cloth to gold it all in. Last year the buckets with chives, parsley and basil growing on the top side did better. I think because it held the water in better for the tomato roots.<br />

Wow! If I knew there was a market for this, I would have had my grandmother patent it years ago. Since I was a little kid, she always grew her tomatoes upside-down -- by just using a simple plastic bucket & a few strategically placed holes.</p>

<p>And, as an added bonus? She planted azaleas on the top, so it not only looked pretty, but it would keep the bugs & other nasty critters from going after the tomato plant underneath.</p>

<p>We coulda been millionaires.<br />

You will need the following materials:<br />

-dirt (more on this later) I used peat moss, manure, and vermiculite<br />

Thank you for your DIY upside down tomato planter. It is the cheapest, most attractive one I've seen online. I planted two with Bush Celebrity Tomatoes and a third one (the one in the middle) planted with Jalapenos. I planted Thai Basil, Italian Parsley, Purple Sage, Sweet Woodruff, Italian Oregano, and Sweet Basil in the top of the planter. I realized that my pots are hanging a too low, so I have to shorten the cord, but I think they came out pretty good! Can't wait to see if my tomaotes and jalapenos will grow good upside down!<br />

      </h3>
      <p>Frost warnings for Ann Arbor for tonight; that's kind of late.</p>

<p>In the spirit of gardeners everywhere, here's some collected recommendations for dealing with frost damage in your garden.</p>

<p>From Zimbabwe and <a href="http://www.farmradio.org/english/radio-scripts/34-7script_en.asp">Farm Radio International</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Protect Tomatoes from Frost

<p>By Livai Matarirano, Zimbabawe</p>

<p>You can grow tomatoes even in cold weather. A farmer in Zimbabwe, Mr. Francis Handwa, uses cooking oil or milk bottles filled with water to keep tomato plants warm. This is a good alternative to covering tomatoes if used bottles are easy to get. Here is how he does it.</p>

<p>Francis fills cooking oil or milk bottles with water until they are three quarters full. While the plants are still young, he places the bottles upright on the ground among the tomatoes. He places one bottle beside every third plant in every other row. He makes sure that the neck of the bottle appears above the plants. When the plants get taller than the bottles he places stakes beside the tomato plants. He hangs a bottle on each stake with a string. The bottles hang 10 centimetres above the plants.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>from <a href="http://www.gardenersnet.com/vegetable/tomato.htm">GardenersNet:</a></p>

<blockquote>
Tomatoes like it hot! They will die if exposed to frost. Make sure to plant them after the last frost.

<p>Tip#1: Cover your young seedling if frost is predicted. A simple and easy cover  for small seedlings is to buy large or extra large plastic disposable cups. Place them over the seedling at dusk, and remove them in the morning. There is usually little or no wind on nights with frost, so they are not easily tipped over.</p>

<p>Tip#2: If you get a light frost overnight and you did not cover up your plants. Go out early before the sun rises, and spray your plants with the garden hose. This melts the ice off the plants and may save them.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.tomatocasual.com/2007/09/26/how-to-continue-harvesting-your-tomatoes-after-a-frost/">Tomato Casual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
If a more serious frost is coming, cover your plants with something to keep the frost from ending up on the leaves. I like to use sheets but anything like plastic, sheeting, newspaper or other material that can be used like a gentle covering will suffice.

<p>Leave the cover on until the temp breaks that frost level in the mid morning and your plants will be none the worse for wear. Do not, however, leave plastic on the plants in the hot sun as this is damaging to the tomato plant and all your attention will be wasted.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://rebeccasgardenblogs.blogspot.com/2006/09/protecting-tomatoes-from-frost.html">Rebecca's Garden Blogs:</a></p>

<blockquote>
If you still have tomatoes on the vine, keep bed sheets on hand. When frost is in the forecast cover the vines early afternoon before the sun starts setting. This will help trap the daytime heat before the soil cools. Also, try to extend the sheets to cover as much ground as possible. I stretch mine out and put a stone on top to hold it in place. This creates a tee pee which too traps more warmth. Remove covering once the sun comes up. 
</blockquote>

<p>From the Columbia Missourian, <a href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/28/put-plants-bed-blanket-tonight/">Put plants to bed with a blanket tonight<br />
</a><blockquote><br />
According to Sapp, it’s best to cover plants with cloth. A simple flannel bed sheet will do the trick, but make sure that it is lifted slightly off the plants so they have a little breathing room. Cardboard also works, Sapp said. Take a box, place it over low plants and flowers, and then open the box top during the day so the plants can soak up the sun.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Sapp said plastic isn’t the best option for covering plants because it doesn’t sufficiently shield them from frost. Stick with cloth and cardboard to save the seedlings.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>From Rutgers University, <a href="http://ifplantscouldtalk.rutgers.edu/planttalk/article.asp?ID=12">Planting and protecting warm season vegetables</a></p>
<blockquote>
Water walls- There are various clear plastic devices that have long tubes connected in a circle. Once the tubes are filled with water, they will stand up on their own and provide a great deal of frost protection for early tomatoes. The water filled tubes heat up during the day and retain heat during cold nights to protect plants. These thick water walls provide effective insulation to counter cool temperatures. The water walls need to be staked to prevent them from blowing over with strong winds. After frost dates have passed, these devices can be removed.
</blockquote>

<p>Stay warm, and keep your tomatoes protected.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>every once in a while you have to look at the net to see what other people say that you are.  so here's that search for a2b3.</p>

<p>First, all the things that don't relate to the lunch meeting:</p>

<p>A2B3 is a rare genotype resulting from the inheritance of both A and B genes on one chromosome.</p>

<p>The p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein inhibits a2b3 integrin-mediated cell spreading on vitronectin by blocking PKC-dependent localization of a2b3 to focal contacts</p>

<p>Unicode Character 'YI SYLLABLE CIEX' (U+A2B3)</p>

<p>These two transcripts differ by 75 bp and the protein that is coded by a2b3 has 25 amino acids more.</p>

<p>Second, the lunch meeting series:</p>

<p>Ed Vielmetti's a2b3 group is quite popular (Thursday lunches; I missed it today while I wrote this blog post)</p>

<p>A2B3 is a physical/virtual community. There are many versions of the creation myth, but all involve a band of hardy explorers on a mission to try all the versions of bi bim bap served at restaurants in Ann Arbor. </p>

<p>The Ann Arbor Bi Bim Bop lunch group (a2b3) is a group of people organized by Edward Vielmetti who meet for lunch on Thursdays in Ann Arbor at Eastern Accents.</p>

<p>a2b3 is a reasonably regular lunch series gathering people from the Ann Arbor area to talk (often about tech stuff, but not always and not exclusively) and share a delicious bowl of bi bim bap. There's no agenda, and a very minimal but evolving bits of organization to make sure that everyone who's coming gets at least a little introduction to everyone else.</p>

<p>A2B3 is a motley collection of geeks, tech wizards, corporate startups, educators, students, hobbyists, politicians, activists, and various other identities who gather once a week for lunch and to discuss interesting ideas.</p>

<p>Started by U-M alum and Internet pioneer Ed Vielmetti as a way to see his friends each week, A2B3 has become an informal nexus for local knowledge workers and entrepreneurs.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0522/p01s05-usgn.html">The Christian Science Monitor has a good story with pictures of the current state of the "Mississippi Cottage" design of manufactured housing.</a></p>

<p><blockquote>Hurricane Katrina downsized his domain to nothing. Today, his new castle is about one-seventh the size of his old one, measuring 450 square feet. But surveying the familiar view from the dollhouse porch of his &ldquo;Mississippi cottage,&rdquo; Mr. Voorhies is one of many storm survivors who have reassessed their coastal existence.</p>

<p>"Small works for me right now," Voorhies says of his cottage, one of nearly 2,400 the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) has given to state residents to replace the FEMA trailer. "There's less to lose."</p>

<p>Not everyone is an enthusiast of the Mississippi cottage – a wheeled version of the now famous Katrina Cottage – despite its compact cuteness. Most communities along the now-rebuilding Gulf Coast have demanded that MEMA haul them out by next March, citing concerns about their storm-worthiness, low assessed values, and aesthetics. That is leading some cottage-dwellers to vow to fight for their abodes, promising a showdown ahead.</blockquote></p>

Here's some small measure of the problem they are up against:</p>

<p><blockquote>
My house was a 1945 Gentilly bungalow with double parlor, original floors, the Gentilly tile, and deco molding. It was in no danger of falling down. My contractor drove by, called, and asked why there were bulldozers on the property the morning they tore it down. Before he could reach us, the house was gone.</p>

<p>I cannot return to the city now. I feel such pure fury when I think of my house being torn down. City bulldozers trespassed on my property and tore down my lovely Gentilly bungalow. New Orleans has nothing to do with America anymore. New Orleans is dead to me, and I will not lift a finger to help or give back to it again.<br />

      <h3>ALL WATCHED OVER BY MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE</h3>

<pre>
I like to think (and
the sooner the better!)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.</pre>

<pre>
I like to think
      (right now, please!)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully 
past computers
as if they were flowers 
with spinning blossoms.
</pre>

<pre>
I like to think
      (it has to be!)
of a cybernetic ecology 
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

bill tozier, nobody can explain what I do</p>

<p>quorum.</p>

<p>tozier: talking, thinking for way too long; read in newspaper.  want to know what we mean.</p>

<p>independent workers, sharing space, resources; share: utilities, all the way to child care, insurance.  </p>

<p>what do people get from coworking?  sharing risks, offer opportunities for collaboration, lowering fixed costs, getting perks not from home.   most people can do this from home.  talking about it as if it was brand new.  started with a2b3 networking lunch.  microcoworking, get together at cafe at regular schedule.  that works, 4-5 up to a dozen, projects, give each other work.  success, too much of a success, can't get this many people in a room to work together.  natural size has hit its size.  </p>

<p>question: what do we do in addition?</p>

<p>suppose there was a shared permanent space in ann arbor, for ann arbor, coffee, drinks, teaching, training, lab work, shop work, art, some subset more than sitting at little tables with laptops.  think there's room for more stuff, not sure what that stuff is, what would you like?  all a different answer (good thing).  think there's enough overlap, don't know how.  </p>

<p>1.  what would IT be to begin with?<br />
2.  what entity would write the checks?  someone takes risk.<br />
3.  what would we do to join?<br />
4.  what do we do next?  </p>

<p>last: write it down when we all have access to it.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>1. donuts?  no donuts.  not our space, don't own it, can't do it there.<br />
2.  need: whiteboard, other people breathing around me<br />
3.  models: people from here, visitors.  "we" is flexible.  compare to hotel.<br />
4.  range of people laptop, +whiteboard, +coding, +hardware all the way to tech shop</p>

<p>we understand "co", now what do we mean "working"</p>

<p>5.  access to tools, especially special tools<br />
6.  how important is seeing other people?<br />
7.  utility of access to people, and not just tools - training<br />
8.  washtenaw community college fabrication class, fridays (students)<br />
9.  need for privacy?  private locker?<br />
10.  pottery guild on hoover, cooperative.  board runs it, dues are paid, students money.<br />
11.  ymca, locker, just "go", don't have to bring everything with you every time.<br />
12.  location: office shared easy, warehouse harder.<br />
13.  ICON office space, $250/mo, printers etc - no longer there<br />
14.  conference phone?  little conference room?  hands free room.<br />
15.  30 people - swan theater below first street, $1500/mo - 25, $60/mo each.<br />
16.  create an organization that's a cooperative?  copy something that's comfortable</p>

<p>do we need to have everything that it's going to be like?</p>

<p>17.  model of membership: join core group, add additional memberships<br />
18.  overlap between "makers" and "laptopper" people<br />
19.  how to get informal networking, cooperation going?  <br />
20.  little production room / sound room<br />
21.  not jump in with huge bureaucracy and accounting process, really simple</p>

<p>(lots of discussion)</p>

<p>22.  model is potter's guild?</p>

<p>what other organizations are models?  </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-threequel-three/">threequel === threequal - of movies, code, and the l33t</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few definitions for you, with citations from the wild; spelling is as in the original with Google counts of occurences, if possible.</p>

<p>In short: threequel and 3quel are about movies; threequal is the "===" operator; 3qual is hacker speak.  More or less.</p>

<h3>threequel (33,900):</h3>

<p>When I was a kid, I assumed all third installments in a horror series had to capitalize on the ability to turn the “3″ in the title into “3-D.” Now, looking back, I only really remember (and can only find proof of) Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th 3-D and Amityville 3-D. But that isn’t stopping me from assuming Hollywood will once again abuse the gimmick.  </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.spout.com/2008/02/27/hollywood-steps-up-to-the-3d-threequel/"><br />
"Hollywood steps up to the 3-D Threequel", SpoutBlog </a> 2008</p>

<p>Spider-Man 3. Shrek 3. Pirates of the Caribbean 3. When did third-installment movies make a comeback? There's already a special multiplex in Hell that shows only Lethal Weapon 3, Beverly Hills Cop 3, and Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College. Below, we evaluate the lasting contributions of other classically bad "threequels."  </p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/05/attack_of_the_threequel.html">"Attack of the Threequel", New York Magazine</a>, 2007</p>

<h3>threequal (1,540):</h3>

<p>The operator === is unique to Ruby (as far as I am aware). The common name for it is the case equality operator because it is used implicitly by case statements. But this is slightly misleading, as I said earlier, because it is not really "equality" at all. In this book, I often use the term relationship operator. I did not invent this term, but I can't find its origin, and it is not in common use today. The "hip and trendy" name for this is the threequal operator ("three equals").  </p>

<p><a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/0768667208/ch01lev1sec6">_The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming_, Second Edition. </a></p>

<p>Every class typically has a "threequal" operator === defined. The expression class === instance will be true if the instance belongs to the class. The relationship operator is usually known as the case equality operator because it is used implicitly in a case statement. This is therefore a way to act on the class of an expression.  </p>

<p>_The Ruby Way_</p>

<p>So (1..5) === 3 is true because 3 is in that range, but 3 isn't equal to that range, so 3 === (1..5) doesn't return true. Logical enough. If you're wondering how you're supposed to remember all this, you aren't. You don't really even need to know it. The === method exists for controlling how a case/when block will evaluate an object. It should never be used by humans. It is code written to be consumed by other code, specifically, by case and when.</p>

<h3>3quel (1,200):</h3>

<p>In its pre-TV glory days, Hollywood made a few series--Andy Hardy, The Thin Man, the Bob Hope-- Bing Crosby Road comedies, and horror films with the whole Frankenstein family. But these were middling fare. The big-ticket items were singular sensations. Nobody made a sequel to Gone With the Wind, Casablanca or Ben-Hur. The industry didn't think in roman numerals until The Godfather, Part II in 1974. But with the triumph of special-effects fantasies like Star Wars, sequels became a smart way to print money. Now they are needed to turn bad years into good ones. The difference between the box-office slump of 2005 and the rebound last year can be attributed to one film: Pirates 2. That's why the trifecta of threequels is crucial to Hollywood's health.</p>

<h3>=== (7,220,000 in Google Code Search; unsearchable in Google)</h3>

<p>Suppose though that we don't want to allow a string containing a three to match with a number three. Let's add another equals.</p>

<p>if (x === y + z) {alert('true');}</p>

<p>This still does a comparison between x and the result of adding y and z but now no conversion of numbers into strings (in fact no type conversions at all) is permitted when doing the actual comparison. Now the values being compared must be of the same data type as well as have the same value. A string containing a three is not of the same type as a number containing a three and so the comparison evaluates as false.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-reification-is/">Reification is an ontological imperative</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Reification is an ontological imperative.</p>

<p>I think that this might be some deep statement about the
semantic web, but it's so deep that I really don't understand it.</p>

<p>Reification in this sense appears to have something to do with
taking abstract concepts and making them concrete, turning 
ad hoc heuristics into code, writing down a set of things into
a list so that it can be machine processed and sorted, and 
otherwise taking thoughts and ideas and turning them into bits.</p>

<p>Ontological has to do with categories and classification, the
relationships between things, and especially how to create data
structures to represent these.  In typical ontologies, the result
is some data structure that looks like a graph, often but not
necessarily a hierarchy, which puts things into buckets based
on their essential features.</p>

<p>If I had to reprocess this through my own experience, it would
have to do with the relationship between writing things down
and sorting through them.  Fundamentally, if you are going to
take a long list of abstractions and make them concrete, you
get as a necessary side effect the ability to distinguish between
them and group them into bunches based on attributes that may
not have been explicit in the abstract conceptions of things.</p>

<p>To see someone else having thought through the repercussions of
this, see:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">
Clay Shirky, "Ontology is overrated"</a>.  On tagging systems
vs. hierarchical classification, and how it's OK to have tag
collections from a bunch of people make sense of the identity
of things on the net vs. having centralized catalogers do that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.librarything.com/thingology/2006/07/tags-reading-and-listening-list.php">
Tim Spalding on Tags: A reading and listening list</a>, from Thing-ology.
Tim has addressed the problem of making explicit people's
information about their own books in a way that makes
collective information visible with LibraryThing, and there's
a lot more to it than just saying "tags rock!".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2008/04/14/detroit-presentation-the-politics-of-metrics/">Ed Yourdon, "The Politics of Metrics"</a>, a talk he gave at the Software Best Practices conference in Detroit in April 2008.
When the thing to be reified is the behavior of individuals, and
the ontology that is applied is a measure of quality or success,
there are all manner of messy politics and second-order effects
that come into play.</p>

<p><a href="http://joechip.net/brian/2007/12/06/alive-to-the-extent/">Brian Kerr channeling Christopher Alexander</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
“To seek the timeless way we first must know the quality without a number. There is a central quality which is the rooted criterion of life and the spirit of man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be numbered.”
</blockquote>

<p>I write this down (reification), and then Typepad insists that I add a category to it (ontological imperative).  It landed in "cyberinfrastructure", this weird bag of side effects of computerizing the world.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-18-freedom-to-go-o/">Freedom, to go offline</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Through some random chance encounter on the net - that is to say,<br />
I don't remember why I found it - I'm offline right now.</p>

<p>The tool of choice for going offline is a little Mac application<br />
called <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/">Freedom</a>, which disables your Internet access for a specified<br />
period of time so that you can get things done.  Written by Fred <br />
Stutzman at UNC.</p>

<blockquote>
Freedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only circumvention of the Freedom time limit you specify. The hassle of rebooting means you're less likely to cheat, and you'll be more productive. Not rebooting is why we bought Apple computers in the first place. When first getting used to Freedom, I suggest using the software for short periods of time.
</blockquote>

<p>It's a great idea, especially for the times when you find yourself<br />
overwhelmed by the 1000000000s of possible things to do when you<br />
are on line, and when reducing the number of options is key to actually<br />
accomplishing any one task.</p>

<p>(Obviously I'm back online to post this!)</p>

<p>Free CNC software from<br />
http://cnc4free.org/</p>

<p>gmax is the cnc4free.org preferred 3D design application  by reason of it's functions, pedigree and ability to expand core features by use of plugins and scripts.  CNC specific tools are available for gmax in the form of the CNC_Toolkit MAXScript plugin.  No other FREE application will function with CNC_Toolkit.  </p>

<p>gmax has single floating-point precision for engineering work. At the same time gmax is also capable of many types of freeform modelling.  gmax is derivative of Autodesk's Autocad and 3D Studio, being essentially a restricted version of 3D Studio Max  V4.

<p>problem to solve: workflow.  how to record audio onto thumb drives? <br />
"i key" recorder:  http://www.ikey-audio.com/ikey.htm<br />
computers everywhere?<br />
appliance? plenty of sound cards out there.  Windows prohibitively expensive.<br />
Cheapest?  Embedded Linux, plus ?   Distributions for a media environment.<br />
replace thumb drive with compact flash?</p>

<p>after much discussion, some recommendation involved Ubuntu, starting from too much and then removing; QEMU can be used to artificially squash down the running system to constrain it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year the <a href="http://www.arcaracing.com/news_flatrock.cfm">Flat Rock Speedway</a> does a race series that includes figure eight bus races.  This year's schedule includes:</p>

<p>June 14: Marco's Pizza School Bus Figure 8, legends cars, factory stock, 4-cylinder.<br />
Sept. 13: Pepsi Cola School Bus Figure 8, street stock.</p>

<p>This year there's also school bus figure 8s at the <a href="http://www.arcaracing.com/news_toledo.cfm">Toledo Speedway</a>:</p>

<p>May 23: Night of Destruction, school bus figure 8, figure 8 train, factory stock, 4-cylinder, backup race, rollover contest.<br />
Sept. 5: Burge Wrecking Night of Destruction, school bus figure 8, boat and train figure 8, factory stock, rollover contest, race car bowling.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.monroenews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080319/SPORTS/79987421">Monroe Evening News</a> has the complete schedule.</p>

<p>For photos and videos of this sport I'll refer you to my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/06/figure_eight_sc.html">2007 figure eight school bus race coverage</a> and my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/figure_eight_sc.html">2006 figure 8 bus race notes</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-09-expert-heuristi/">Expert heuristics for problem solving - George Polya&#39;s &#34;How To Solve It&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It is characteristic of an expert to have a systematic approach to problem solving.</p>

<p>A very good example of this is George Polya's <a href="http://edwardvielmetti.vox.com/library/post/this-book-wow.html">How To Solve It</a>, subtitled "A new aspect of the mathematical method".  In it he prepares the math student for a problem solving approach, not so much by the memorization of zillions of dry facts, but an approach and a set of heuristics (read "methods", "rules", or even "hacks") for dealing with a broad range of mathematical questions, discovery and invention.</p>

<p>The core of How To Solve It is a structured approach to problem solving, and a dictionary of techniques which can be applied to this structure. </p>

<p>First. You have to understand the problem.<br />
Second.  Find the connection between the data and the unknown.  You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found.  You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution.<br />
Third.  Carry out your plan.<br />
Fourth.  Examine the solution obtained.</p>

<p>The dictionary of heuristic follows with short pithy entries on technique, questions like "What is the unknown?" and strategies like "Decomposing and recombining".</p>

<p>This book is a math book, but more than that it's a way of thinking about things - and as such, I've found it useful to refer to whenever I embark on a new project to help me understand what I'm after and the sorts of things I need to learn along the way to get to a satisfactory answer.  It is as well a brilliant example of how to distill expertise into a handbook which can carry on teaching long after the expert is gone.</p>

      <p>How do you become an expert in a field?  By writing about that field, repeatedly, until you have mastered it to the level which people find you easily and draw on your expertise.</p>

<p>A big part of being able to write about something twice a day is to have a ready collection of other people to call on for ideas or to ask for details or referrals.   By being ready to tap into other people's expertise, you figure out what you need to know fast.</p>

<p>Here from <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/12/bird_by_bird_an.html">Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
There are an enormous number of people out there with invaluable information to share with you, and all you have to do is pick up the phone.  They love it when you do, just as you love it when people ask if they can pick your brain about something you happen to know a great deal about -- or, as in my case, have a number of impassioned opinions on.

<p>One of the regular top hits on my blog is the post I did about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/06/who-do-i-call-t.html">how to report a noise complaint in Ann Arbor.</a>  Recently, <a href="http://twitter.com/a2snooze/statuses/805588556">the local college has been doing a little bit of construction around their playing field, and some of the neighbors have complained about the sound.</a></p>

<p>If you were going to spend too much money to monitor noise, you'd put together some kind of infrastructure with data loggers at various points around the area, all of which sent their readings (and perhaps audio capture) back to a central system for analysis and reporting and alerting.  Here's some of what I was able to find out about that.</p>

<p>From Make Magazine:  <a href="http://avello.viewbook.com/volumen">"Volumen", a giant graphic equalizer built by Argentinian artist, Sergio Avello</a> relays the ambient urban noise levels around the Redgaleria in Buenos Aires. Pretty intense way of visualizing the constant buzz of the city, plus nice shots of the internal circuits.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://nonoise.org/">Noise Pollution Clearinghouse</a> has a vast array of information and experts about noise pollution.  Their sponsors include <a href="http://www.quest-technologies.com/index.htm">Quest Technologies</a>, makers of a bunch of noise level monitoring and analysis tools.</p>

<p>In the mining industry, a company called Vipac markets an <a href="http://www.vipac.com.au/mining/products/envnoisemon.htm">environmental noise monitor</a> with built in GSM phone (so you can call in and listen), an MP3 recorder which clicks in when sound exceeds a threshold, a solar cell for off-grid use and reporting of data back to a central web server for analysis.  No price listed.</p>

<p>Noisemeters.com has a <a href="http://www.noisemeters.com/product/soundear/soundlog.asp">data logging, noise metering sign</a> with clear graphics showing when sound levels have been exceeded on a big indoor sign, and a data logger which collects information about noise levels that can be downloaded from a PC (not real time).  w/software, this runs about $1200.  They also have a <a href="http://www.noisemeters.com/product/cr2434.asp">Noise Pole</a> outdoor monitor mounted permanently high out of the way unobtrusively with similar logging (call for pricing) and a <a href="http://www.noisemeters.com/product/cr2434.asp">portable logging noise monitor</a> which runs about $9000.</p>

<p>CSN sells a <a href="http://www.csnstores.com/Virco-LIBLITE-VR1704.html">Virco LIBLITE</a> designed for indoor cafeteria use with a red-yellow-green stoplight style display, designed either to get kids in a cafeteria to scream at the top of their lungs or to quiet them down (not clear what the actual results would be).</p>

<hr/>

<p>I didn't find some simple homebrew system, but the "graphic equalizer" direction seems like it might be reasonable - how hard could it be to turn an iPhone into a portable noise meter of some kind?</p>

<p>At the low end these are called "sound level meters", here's a <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2006/12/30/affordable-noise-meter-puts-a-number-to-the-annoyance">review of a $50 device</a>, with no remote reading capability.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-07-joy-yuill-1932/">Joy Yuill (1932-2008)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/508946.html?nav=5007">as printed in the Marquette Mining Journal, April 22 2008</a>.  Joy and Baldy were neighbors of ours in Marquette.</p>

<p>REPUBLIC — Joy Elizabeth Yuill, 75, of 11676 River Road, Republic, and former Marquette resident, entered eternal life Tuesday afternoon, April 15, 2008, at her home in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula Home Health & Hospice.</p>

<p><br />
Born September 11, 1932, in Gaylord, the daughter of Stanley and Dorothy (Siegel) Yuill, Joy was raised in Vanderbilt and graduated from the Gaylord High School in 1949. She attended Hillsdale College for a year before transferring to Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, where she received a bachelor of science degree in education in 1953. Joy taught in Detroit, while also taking classes at Wayne State University, which led to her receiving her master’s degree in special education in 1956, with special emphasis on blind and partially sighted clients. In 1957, Joy moved to Marquette, traveling extensively throughout the Upper Peninsula to serve sight-impaired students. In 1971, Joy received a nursing degree from Northern Michigan University, working at Marquette General Hospital mostly on weekends. She retired from her nursing career in 2000. For over 17 years, Joy worked summers at Bay Cliff Health Camp in Big Bay as a special education teacher and swimming instructor. She retired from this position in 2005 and then assisted with adult campers for one week each year. 1972 was to produce yet another degree for Joy, this time a master’s degree in music from Wayne State. Joy continued teaching full time until 2002 and thereafter taught on a part-time basis for the next two years. When not in the classroom, Joy was the piano accompanist for the Marquette Male Chorus for many years. She also assisted many students with their solo and ensemble pieces at the Negaunee and Westwood high schools for over 20 years. Known locally for her beautiful renditions on the harp, Joy was a participant in many concerts and musical programs over the years. She was a member of the United Presbyterian Church in Ishpeming. In June 1963, Joy married Vincent “Baldy” Bur, and he preceded her in death in 1999. Joy and Baldy were great animal lovers and took in all sorts of stray and unwanted animals over the years. In her leisure, she enjoyed baking bread, knitting, sewing, gardening, and being involved in anything musical.</p>

<p><br />
Joy is survived by her brother, Robert “Beezle” Yuill of Harvey; a brother-in-law, Leonard Bur of Marquette; sister-in-law, Amelia Kent of North Little Rock, Ark.; her niece, Martha Yuill of St. Paul, Minn.; and a nephew, Stephen Yuill of Ishpeming. In addition to her parents and husband, Joy was preceded in death by sisters-in-law, Christine Yuill and Verna Bur; and a nephew, Michael Bur. </p>

<p><br />
The family will receive relatives and friends at the United Presbyterian Church in Ishpeming on Saturday, May 10, beginning at 1 p.m. A memorial service will follow at 2 p.m. Saturday with the Rev. James Robb officiating. Memorials may be directed to the Marquette County Humane Society, 84 Snowfield Road, Negaunee, MI 49866; or to the United Presbyterian Church, 112 E. Euclid St., Ishpeming, MI 49849.</p>

<p><br />
The Fassbender Funeral Home is serving the family, where condolences may be expressed online at <a href="http://www.fassbenderfuneralhome.com">www.fassbenderfuneralhome.com</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-06-ann-arbor-may-6/">Ann Arbor May 6 2008 election results and AutoMARK voting issues</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'll link to election results when they go online here.  <a href="http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/elections/election_results">The Washtenaw County site has the official results.</a>  The <A href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/05/ann_arbor_millage_renewals_lea.html">Ann Arbor News</a> has coverage on the blog, but, true to form, they don't link to the official results site in their coverage.</p>

<p><a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/may2008/cumulativereport.html">Early returns</a> (63% counted at 9:30pm) have both Ann Arbor millage proposals passing 3-1, and incumbent school board member Helen Gates-Bryant leading 2-1.  Voter turnout looks like it's going to be less than 10% county wide. </p>

<p>This is the second election that I've tried to vote using the AutoMARK machines used to provide assistive technology for those with low vision.  The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/01/michigan-primar.html">first time I tried this back in January I failed to make it work</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The technological snafu was voting as though I was a vision-impaired voter and trying to use the AutoMARK machines provided for that purpose.... The machine marks ballots with audio prompting; it has awful industrial design, a very clumsy ballot shield, the poll workers had not run a real ballot through it all day (just a sample ballot), and when it spat back my ballot a half dozen times they directed me to the hand marked ballot booth rather than spoiling the ballot and starting with a new piece of paper.
</blockquote>

<p>I got to the polling place a little bit earlier this time and tried it again.  It misbehaved the same way, but this time there was time to figure it out, so the poll workers called in their expert who drove over to help figure it out.  The solution ended up to be very simple: the detachable stub on the ballot must be detached before putting the ballot into the machine, despite the very clear instructions on that stub not to detach it, and with no visible instructions to detach it anywhere on the AutoMARK machine.</p>

<p>I was able to find with some digging a <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ElectionDayGuide_174575_7.pdf">AutoMARK Troubleshooting Guide</a>, which mentions two possible solutions: either remove the stub before putting the ballot into the machine, or program the machine to recognize the stub.  I don't know whether this stub length programming is possible with the ballots we are using.</p>

<blockquote>If the ballot has a stub, 
the stub length may not 
have been entered into the 
election setup information.</blockquote>

<p>Note that the system did work with the sample ballot tested by the poll workers - but the sample ballot did not have a stub at the top!  </p>

<p>Note for next time: vote early (and vote often), and tear the stub off before inserting the ballot into the AutoMARK machine, despite all of the instructions to the contrary.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>More AutoMARK issues, as I find them around the net:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adaweb.net/departments/ClerkAuditorRecorder/Response3.asp">Ada County, ID</a>:  " About 90% of the precincts encountered problems testing the machines because the stub was still attached. This is clearly our fault. The ballots we trained with did not have stubs on them. We never thought about the significance of that and obviously the manufacturer did not consider that either"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/depart/sc/grandjury/0405/0504r1.pdf">Contra Costa County, CA</a>: "During the March Election, the Grand Jury observed the following:  a. The perforation on the ballot stub, which the voter received, did not always tear cleanly, complicating insertion of the ballot into the scanner. "</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-06-personalized-tr/">Personalized transit planning for the AATA</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Some notes on something that doesn't exist yet, but should.</p>

<p>Imagine a service that has URLs like</p>

<p>http://wheresmybus.org/route/5/inbound/packard+granger/3<br />
http://wheresmybus.org/route/any/inbound/packard+state/0<br />
http://wheresmybus.org/route/any/any/stone-school+eisenhower/4</p>

<p>and which has a very simple output of the times you need to leave to catch the next bus</p>

<p>8:04<br />
8:22</p>

<p>based on the following:</p>

<p>real time bus location information (via mobile ridetrak), for buses already en route, and then estimated times for scheduled buses not yet visible.  This is scrapable from existing services.</p>

<p>previously estimated, interpolated times for time points, so "packard+granger" is known to be "packard+south" plus 2 minutes.  Interpolation is something that the AATA won't provide, but if you know your route you can probably get within a minute or two.</p>

<p>user specified time offsets to show time you spend to get to the bus stop, the "3" in the above giving me time to walk out the door and walk to the bus, but not to run.</p>

<p>The "any" route variant would let you simultaneously get information about next-bus routing for stops that have multiple lines serving them, and also let you go in any direction just in case you want the "anywhere but here" bus system.</p>

<p>In my typical use of mobile ridetrak I often do this computation in my head (oh, the bus is 8 minutes late...let's see, that means I can leave at ... or walk down how many stops?)  That's a lot of math for what should be straightforward for a computer to put together, and if you crunched this down tiny enough it could fit on a very tiny screen.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>reposted from the <a href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/obits/obit/672/">Columbia Missourian</a></p>

<p>COLUMBIA — Marie V. Scholes, a Columbia resident for 60 years, loved reading and conversation about politics and history.</p>

<p>“She seemed to know everything and was extremely intelligent,” said her niece, Diane Lucas. “You could have a good conversation on anything with her even if you didn’t agree. We agreed to disagree on politics.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Scholes wasn’t talking about history and politics, she was reading about it. </p>

<p>“She read everything,” Lucas said. “Her house was packed with history, politics and mystery books.”</p>

<p>She also enjoyed playing bridge and working crossword puzzles.</p>

<p>“She was just neat, she knew everything and was never judgemental,” Lucas said. “She was the best aunt there could be.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Scholes died Wednesday, April 16, 2008, at The Bluffs. She was 91.</p>

<p>She was born Nov. 20, 1916, in Norway, Mich., to Max and Mary Vielmetti. She attended the University of Michigan where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honorary societies and received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. </p>

<p>She married Walter V. Scholes, who was a member of the MU history department, in 1941. Mrs. Scholes co-authored a book with her husband in 1970, “The Foreign Policies of the Taft Administration.”</p>

<p>“She and her husband spent many summers in London among other places,” Lucas said.</p>

<p>She is survived by five nieces and nephews, 10 great-nieces and great-nephews and eight great-great-nieces and great-great-nephews.</p>

<p>Her husband, one sister and five brothers preceded her in death.</p>

You don't really think I'm going to tell you where to pick morels, do you?  Even my mom won't tell me where she gets hers.</p>

<p>What I can share is some set of things that people are tracking for timing for when morels appear, and forums where this stuff is being discussed by experts.</p>

<p>There is a terrific list of <a href="http://thegreatmorel.com/info.html">morel mushroom information</a> carefully collected by The Great Morel; lots to read, if you want to know more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michigan-sportsman.com/forum/showthread.php?p=2078720">The Michigan Sportsman Forums</a> report on <a href="http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morel_progression_sightings_map.htm">the Morel Progression Sightings Map</a> for the year, which gives you big dots showing approximate locations.

<p>Absolute Michigan's story on the <a href="http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/michigan-morels-and-the-boyne-city-mushroom-festival/">2007 Boyne City Mushroom Festival</a> includes plenty of details.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.grayling-mi.com/morel.html">Grayling, MI visitors bureau guide to the morels of Crawford County Michigan</a> gives away details, but being coy, recommends that you bring your own log book and note where you found yours.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Mike Gould of Ann Arbor has a story originally in the Ann Arbor Observer about <a href="http://www.mondodyne.com/a2observer/morels.shtml">Roonquest: the mushrooms that bloom in the spring</a> about morel hunting near Charlevoix.</p>

<p>UPDATE: More morel information by video at Youtube - see e.g. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/VideoMorelHunting"> VideoMorelHunting</a> collection of accounts and movies.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-04-23-garlic-mustard/">Garlic Mustard in Michigan (via MSU IPM)</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.ipm.msu.edu/garlicmustard.htm">Garlic Mustard in Michigan</a>, a report and information from Michigan State University:
</p>
<blockquote>
Garlic mustard is an exotic invasive plant from Europe that invades woodland habitats in North America and impacts forest biodiversity. In some woodlands, dense stands of garlic mustard in the spring threaten showy spring blooming ephemerals like spring beauty, trilliums and trout lilies. Other research points toward potentially negative impacts on timber species and forest health. Many land managers consider it to be one of the most potentially harmful and difficult to control invasive plants in the region.
</blockquote>
<p>
It's time to pull garlic mustard again, which is a sure sign of spring.  Our yard has a little bit, not too bad, and certainly not as bad as it was a few years ago before we realized just what we had that was growing so vigorously.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/04/where_else_can_.html">Last year at this time</a> I recounted a tale of where to go for a walk in the woods, and the story of the celebration of the garlic mustard recipe of the year.  (in summary, bleah.)  As a reminder:
</p>
<blockquote>
So I made it and tasted it. Not particularly good, and I'm still dealing with the tummy ache. Perhaps someone else has a better recipe, or I picked it too late in the season, or it really just doesn't taste that good? I will admit to not adding the vinegar (or, as Allen Bailey suggested, lemon juice) which might have been the problem. Next time, I'll also cook the greens in a change or two of water first, which should also draw off some of the bitterness.
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have an awesome garlic mustard recipe - or, if you know a source for a supply of pygmy goats that will eat the stuff - pls. note in the comments.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-04-23-supermemo-and-m/">supermemo and morning coffee ritual memory</a>
      </h3>
      <p>An important piece of having coffee in the morning is making it part of a routine.  If you're predictable in your habits, you start to see the same people in the same space at the same time, and you get to be something of a regular.</p>

<p>If you're careful, and switch your morning allegiances from time to time but still visit the old haunts often enough, you can be what passes for a regular long after you stopped coming every day.</p>

<p>How often, then, do you need to show up for people to remember you?  For that I turn to structured repetition, and the power of priming memory periodically to strengthen it.  <a href="http://www.supermemo.com">Supermemo</a>, a software package for memory improvement, has a nice paper on <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/paper.htm">using Supermemo without a computer</a>, which specifies a pattern of repetitions and intervals to get details into memory.  The table of intervals specified says that you review materials at this pace:</p>

<p>4 days, 7 days, 12 days, 20 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 5 months, 9 months, 16 months, 2 years, 4 years, 6 years, 11 years, 18 years</p>

<p>Which suggests that a well-timed practice of showing up at a cafe, introducing yourself to everyone, learning their names, and them coming back at precisely timed intervals to repeat the process would be enough to make you a regular in no time at all.</p>

Today as of Apr. 23 3:45 AM EDT<br/>
which is OK for current information (albeit wordy) but useless for the forecast.</p>
<p>I'd like something between <br/>
48104: Today: Mostly cloudy through mid morning...then becoming partly sunny. An isolated light shower during the morning...then a chance of showers and thunderstorms through 6 PM. Highs 72 to 76. Light and variable winds...becoming north 5 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30 percent.<br/>
and<br/>
48104: Isolated Thunderstorms. High: 76 Low: 46<br/>
all to fit in the 140 character Twitter format.</p>
