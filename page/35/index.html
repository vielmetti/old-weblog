<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-23-hurricane-season-2012/">Hurricane season, 2012</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Each year is a new hurricane season, and each year the internet is a little different. Here&#39;s some things that are new that I&#39;ve noticed.</p>
<p>Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come. The word of the year is &quot;<a href="http://www.spaghettimodels.com" target="_self">spaghetti model</a>&quot;, illustrated below, showing a whole series of separate tracks from different atmospheric models to predict a set of possible futures for the storm.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-pi"><img alt="643281402" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31710ad8970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="643281402" /></a><br />Another novel thing this year is the appearance of the hurricane app for your smart phone or iPad. <a href="http://kittycode.com/products/hurricane-hd/" target="_self">Hurricane HD</a>&#0160;for your iPad focuses solely on hurricane tracking, giving you alerts and forecasts and graphical updates as conditions change. (I haven&#39;t used it, but the screen shots look good and straightforward). The <a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/New-Hurricane-App-Brings-Safety-Information-to-Smart-Phones" target="_self">Red Cross Hurricane App</a>&#0160;includes&#0160;“I’m safe” messaging that allows users to broadcast reassurance to family and friends via social media outlets that they are out of harm’s way. Both have access to <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/" target="_self">NOAA Weather Radio</a>, which is one of the typical channels found on any of the scanner apps that are available.</p>
<p>If you are interested in listening to hurricane radio traffic, one good source is <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>. In addition to listening to police scanners and fire service radios, you can also tune into the <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?feedId=9559" target="_self">National Hurricane Center SKYWARN network</a>&#0160;and hear weather and condition reports directly from amateur radio operators in the field.</p>
<p>One thing that hasn&#39;t changed is the excellent hurricane coverage from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com" target="_self">Weather Underground</a>, with the <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html" target="_self">weblog of Dr. Jeff Masters</a> a clear and precise account as conditions change. The comment board on this blog is notable for being well behaved and well informed, a rarity in this day and age. Weather Underground was recently purchased by Weather.com. There&#39;s no visible changes yet to hurricane information, but a few more TWC meteorologists are blogging on the wunderground site.</p>
<p>Here in Michigan, the worst we can expect from a hurricane is flooding from the far-north remnants of a storm. Others will not be so lucky. Do your best to be prepared.</p>

      <p>For the most part, I don&#39;t comment on newspaper web sites any more; it&#39;s generally more effective to engage by writing the same message directly to the reporter or to the editor.</p>
<p>In some cases, good results can also be had by sending messages directly to the parties involved in the story, and cc&#39;ing (or bcc&#39;ing) the reporter in question.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect.</p>
<p>The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZxe-2rtOGo" target="_self">video from &quot;battlebauble&quot; on YouTube</a> looks convincing. We ended up picking out the bones after it had been cooked.</p>
<p>The trout was from the <a href="http://www.springvalleytroutfarm.com/" target="_self">Spring Valley Trout Farm</a> in Dexter, and the boys were there as part of Summers-Knoll summer &quot;Escape Camp&quot;.</p>
<p>FUN!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-17-twitter-api-changes-cause-obvious-problems-for-developers/">Twitter API changes cause obvious problems for developers</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &quot;I&#39;m eating a sandwich&quot;.) Here&#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.</p>
<p>From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &quot;<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes" target="_self">Interpreting some of Twitter&#39;s API changes</a>&quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application. His conclusion is stark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter has left themselves a lot of wiggle-room with the rules. Effectively, Twitter can decide your app is breaking a (potentially vague) rule at any time, or they can add a new rule that your app inadvertently breaks, and revoke your API access at any time. [...]</p>
<p>I sure as hell wouldn’t build a business on Twitter, and I don’t think I’ll even build any nontrivial&#0160;<em>features</em>&#0160;on it anymore.</p>
<p>And if I were in the Twitter-client business, I’d start working on another product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="http://app.net" target="_self">App.net</a> has grand designs to be a Twitter clone, based on three elements: a solid realtime engine for data, a well defined open API, and a subscription supported model (rather than an advertising supported model) for making the whole thing pay. Dalton Caldwell&#39;s manifesto is a worthwhile read, &quot;<a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal" target="_self">Announcing an audacious proposal</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe so deeply in the importance of having a financially sustainable realtime feed API &amp; service that I am going to refocus App.net to become&#0160;<strong>exactly that</strong>. I have the experience, vision, infrastructure and team to do it. Additionally, we already have much of this built: a polished native iOS app, a robust technical infrastructure currently capable of handing ~200MM API calls per day with no code changes, and a developer-facing API provisioning, documentation and analytics system. This isn’t vaporware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/global/" target="_self">alpha.app.net channel</a>&#0160;is full of want to be superstar application developers figuring out how their new idea could work in this new space.</p>
<p>There are two applications that I use that could be affected by this set of changes. One is Pinboard, which is a bookmarking tool that (among other things) reads and archives my Twitter stream. Pinboard&#39;s developer Maciej Ceglowski has a very funny, no holds barred <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard" target="_self">Twitter account for Pinboard</a>, where he among other things promotes his own service by retweeting posts from the accounts of his competitor Delicious. Here&#39;s his take on app.net:<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 7" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01676952ae15970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 7" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;d be sad if my Twitter backups didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The unusual Twitter client that I use which is most likely to run up against the new look-and-feel guidelines of the Twitter API is <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/" target="_self">ttytter</a>, a command line client written in Perl by Cameron Kaiser. It looks nothing like the official Twitter apps of any kind.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 8" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01761747085d970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 8" /></a><br />It&#39;s hard enough to insist on API and look-and-feel rules with applications that are user configurable; imagine what it must be like to enforce those rules when the application is delivered as relatively easy to modify source code. How can you make sure people don&#39;t break the rules if they can change their own code?</p>
<p>Twitter has some reasonable reasons to want to narrow the scope of what third parties can do with their service, but it&#39;s not going to come without a fight. Expect a tug of war between innovation and conformity, and it&#39;s safe to say that some of that innovation that comes at a high cost and low value to Twitter will be squashed out. I&#39;ll be particularly interested in the delicate balance between value provided by Twitter to advertisers (who pay directly) and social media marketers (who often ride for free) on the service.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m working on a lot of things, or so it seems, but right now I just want to write.</p>
<p>The working environment at the moment is the Chrome browser, with 6 tabs open. Two are Gmail accounts, one is Twitter, one is the Typepad dashboard from which I&#39;m writing this, and one is a Google Analtyics window set to &quot;real time&quot; view for Arborwiki. A sixth tab is currently on Google search, but it varies from time to time.</p>
<p>There are people who keep hundreds of open tabs, but I&#39;m not one of them - my usual plan for dealing with a surplus of work in progress is either to blog or twitter about it or to pin up a bookmark with Pinboard and then close the window.</p>
<p>Most notably from a productivity perspective is that Facebook doesn&#39;t fit into the picture. My Facebook stream has turned into a political circus, and I don&#39;t like wading through artful graphics making fun of politicians on all sides. It&#39;s tedious, and it makes me think that I could give up on Facebook mostly and not miss it.</p>

<p>The bike-trip planners for New York and Washington were built as demonstrations, said Kevin Webb, the Washington-based co-director of transportation at OpenPlans. Much of the technical work was already done for the Portland project, so it wasn’t a huge leap to create the new sites.</p>

      <p>How many people do you need to know before it&#39;s likely that two have the same full name?</p>
<p>The answer is going to depend critically on the pool of people you are sampling from, and whether you count people in multiple generations as Sr., Jr. as &quot;same name&quot;. Similarly, middle initials or middle names will be distinguishing marks. What I&#39;m after is less about collisions within a family and more about two John Jones in your addressbook, otherwise completely unrelated.</p>
<p>I suspect that the number is in the low thousands, just from personal experience.&#0160;</p>

      <p>After writing about power problems that affected thousands of homes, it&#39;s hard to imagine a problem that would take out 700 million subscribers.

<p>Twenty of India&#39;s 28 states were hit by power cuts, along with the capital, New Delhi, when three of the five electricity grids failed at lunchtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Power Grid Corporation of India&#39;s <a href="http://www.powergridindia.com/PGCIL_NEW/news.aspx" target="_self">press release on the subject</a> provides some details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A disturbance occurred in the NR, ER and NER electricity grid at 1300 hours today leading to a blackout in these regions except survival of small pockets in Delhi, Kolkata, Narora etc. Supply to affected regions is being extended from Western and Southern Region grids. Presently supply to NR has been extended from Gwalior on Gwalior-Agra line up to Delhi stations. Supply to railway traction and metro has been restored to almost all the points. Hydro Stations in NR have been started and supply has restored up to Punjab and Haryana areas also. Startup supply has been extended to Singrauli, Rihand via Vindhyachal and startup supply to Talchar has been extended from Western Region It is expected that supply to all the major points in affected regions shall be made available in 2 to 3 of hours time.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Microcoworking is independent workers and freelancers working together at the same time in a coffee shop, sharing ideas and conversation. It&#39;s more informal than the coworking facilities that have sprung up all over the country, but it shares with them the idea that just because you&#39;re working on your own you don&#39;t have to be alone.</p>
<p>Today Laura Fisher, Patti Smith and I restarted a microcoworking cell that had been on hiatus for a while, meeting at Zingerman&#39;s Next Door. We did some editing work together, Patti and I, and Laura showed off her stylish <a href="https://www.sensubrush.com/" target="_self">Sensu brush</a> for the iPad. The music started out as a 70s mix which gave us all the appropriate flashbacks in time.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>According to Facebook, none of my friends have a birthday today. How many friends do I have to have so that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that there will be a birthday every day of the year?</p>
<p>An answer comes from the blog <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/" target="_self">Math Goes Pop!,</a> referencing the well known <a href="http://www.mathgoespop.com/2009/07/math-gets-around-on-birthdays-and-trading-cards.html">&quot;coupon collector&#39;s problem&quot;.</a></p>
<blockquote>What’s known about this problem? Well, as I said above, even if you buy hundreds of thousands of cards, or stuff millions of people in a room, there’s no guarantee that you’ll collect every card or every date. However, on average, the number of cards you’ll need to go through to complete a set of size n is about n*log n.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In terms of birthdays, this says that if you want to collect every date, on average you’ll need to pool together around 2,153 people. Why such a large number? It’s not unreasonable to expect something like this – when you first begin collecting people, it won’t be hard to get people with different birthdays. However, as your numbers increase, you’ll get a new birthday less and less frequently. Finding that last birthday could prove to be quite elusive.</blockquote>
<p>No birthdays today means no existential angst about filling in witty, brief birthday greetings to all of your friends. You could have <a href="http://www.skelliewag.org/why-you-should-start-a-swipe-file-today-137.htm">swipe file</a> of pithy and varied greetings that can be cut and pasted in with loving care. (Especially if you have 2,153 people to greet annually.)</p>

<p>A spill on this pipeline near Milwaukee led to it being shut down for a time this week, and even though the pipeline is back in operation, the effects linger in the form of a fuel shortage in the UP. Prices have gone up because distributors need to make an extra long run from Milwaukee to get their supplies.</p>
<p>In response to this, Michigan&rsquo;s Governor Snyder has declared a fuel emergency for the UP. <a href="http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=780149#.UA9gb2kUHF9" target="_self">From TV6 in Marquette:</a></p>
<blockquote>The executive order makes drivers of gasoline trucks exempt from weekly hours of service restrictions to make sure demand is met.&nbsp; The order remains in effect until it is rescinded or until August 7 at 11:59 p.m., whichever comes first.&nbsp; Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker also declared an energy emergency on Saturday.</blockquote>
<p>As noted in the comments on the TV6 story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, I think for the first time ever there was a real reason for a spike in gas prices in the UP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good to know the maps of key infrastructure so you can see after the fact how systems are interdependent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE July 26, 2012: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that wells in the area of the pipeline spill have been contaminated. <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/washington-county-pipeline-break-soils-private-wells-5p68kib-163798766.html" target="_self">Story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private wells at three rural homes north of Western Ave. in the Town of Jackson are contaminated with gasoline that spilled out of a break discovered last week in a regional pipeline, a spokesman for West Shore Pipe Line Co. said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Benzene levels in water from the wells exceed the federal safe drinking water standard of 5 parts per billion, and those families will be provided bottled water. Benzene is known to cause cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UPDATE October 9, 2013: The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel continues to track the spread of benzene from the gasoline spill. <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/large-gasoline-spill-linked-to-benzene-detected-in-village-of-jackson-well-b99115765z1-226939341.html">The story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A July 2012 gasoline pipeline spill in the Town of Jackson is the likely source of benzene detected in a Village of Jackson municipal well in May of this year, a village consultant&rsquo;s investigation determined.
<p>
This is the first contamination of a municipal well linked to the spill of 54,600 gallons of gasoline from a fuel distribution line owned by West Shore Pipe Line Co. of Illinois.
<p>
A total of 44 private wells in the town within a 1-mile radius of the spill have been contaminated with benzene or other gasoline compounds, records show.
<p>
Though well No. 6 is more than 2 miles northwest of the pipeline rupture, pumping of the well in early July determined it drew ground water out of fractured dolomite rock beneath the spill site in the 1800 block of Western Ave., according to the consultant&rsquo;s report.

<p>The 2012 Michigan hay crop is not looking good, due to widespread drought conditions. <a href="http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/still_time_to_increase_2012_hay_crop/" target="_self">From Michigan State Extension</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dry weather of 2012 has left most livestock producers in the Midwest scrambling for more hay. First cutting hay yields were down 20 – 40 percent in much of Michigan and with the dry weather intensifying, total hay yields for the year could be off by 50 percent or more. In order to feed ruminant animals such as beef cattle, sheep and others through the winter season many are looking for ways stretch their feed resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their first recommendation is &quot;Cover what you have first&quot;. Losses due to spoilage range from 4-7 percent for well-covered hay to 20-35 percent for baled hay left out in the fields.</p>
<p>If you need hay as feed, one source (for information at least) is the <a href="http://www.hayexchange.com/" target="_self">Internet Hay Exchange</a>. It&#39;s a marvel of Craiglist-style old school Internet simplicity in design, with offers from hay sellers for each state. As of this writing, a big round bale of alfalfa/timothy hay would set you back $60 picked up from Montague, MI, or $80 delivered, according to <a href="http://www.hayexchange.com/display_detail_hay.php?id=43117" target="_self">this listing</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedgeree" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Kedgeree">Kedgeree</a> - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water</li>
<li>safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it</li>
<li>spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar</li>
<li>vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
<li>fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon</li>
<li>greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch</li>
<li>hard boiled eggs for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p>The method runs roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Cook the rice first; if you happen to have enough leftover rice, you can use that.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large pan, and saute the onion (and possibly garlic) for 3-5 minutes until soft. Add the spices which will give the onions a wonderful color and smell when thoroughly mixed.</p>
<p>Mix in the vegetables so that they are heated through or cooked; again, suitably prepared leftovers would work here.</p>
<p>Add the rice to the onion mixture, stirring well. Add lemon juice.</p>
<p>Flake the fish and mix in with the rice. Mix in chopped parsley or cilantro. Stir well, and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with hard boiled eggs if desired.</p>
<p>- end -</p>

      <p>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&#39;s going on in real time.

<p>There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary. To help follow this, Twitter had adopted the #aacitycouncil hash tag to follow along. Last night, though, AnnArbor.com reporter Ryan Stanton had this great suggestion:</p>

It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either).</p>
<p>The blog Brandland USA did this <a href="http://www.brandlandusa.com/2008/07/02/were-lovin-remastered-casey-kasem-at-40/">2008 piece on the revival of American Top 40</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Yes, you can still catch Casey Kasem’s original 1970s American Top 40 radio shows on your local FM. The shows have returned from a tape morgue in Hollywood, and have been completely remastered. They were remastered by “syndicated radio junkies” at the Cabot, Arkansas based audio restoration firm Charis Music Group. Charis has posted original “Cue sheets” on its website so nostalgia junkies like us can read along with the shows.</blockquote>
<p>And with that hint, I was able to search enough to find this set listing on <a href="http://staxofwaxtopofthepops.blogspot.com/2012/07/casey-kasems-at40-80s-july-7th-2012.html" target="_self">Stax of Wax</a>, the precise music played 30 years ago on the July 4 weekend show in 1982.&#0160;</p>
