        <p>There is a tremendous appeal to the deletionist point of view.  I spent some time this evening improving Wikipedia by suggesting that some of its less well written articles be removed. The task was relatively simple; hit the &quot;random page&quot; button, read the article, decide if it is so horrible as to be unencyclopedic, and if it is then paste in the &quot;please delete this&quot; template and hope for the best. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-deletionism-or-the-grim-reaper/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A France-based school of writing called &quot;Oulipo&quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is an entire novel written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format.  A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-01-a-salute-to-oulipo-providing-inspiration-since-my-keyboard-is-missing-a-key-and-i-wonder-if-anyone-w/">&raquo;</a></p>

I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-30-some-reflection-on-use-of-github-as-an-issue-tracker-two-weeks-in/">&raquo;</a></p>

Working on something every single day is hard.

I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-28-750-words-on-blogging-memory-and-forgetting-ive-been-blogging-for-a-long-time-and-writing-online-for-longer-than-that-27/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private Facebook forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-27-ubiquity-focus-and-isolation-as-success-factors-for-internet-socialiability/">&raquo;</a></p>

The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.

        <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-22-my-goal-sitting-down-to-write-this-is-to-write-a-thousand-words-exhorting-you-to-occasionally-sit-down-and-write-long-about/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means.
The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-20-task-surfing-which-is-to-say-not-multitasking-with-github/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Students and teachers from the photography class at Marquette Alternative High School (MAHS) create a calendar each year. The project showcases their work and funds a field trip for the students. This year&#39;s 2013 calendar features pictures of Marquette, the butterfly house on Mackinac Island, and the DeYoung Family Zoo in Wallace. The cost is $20 and it&#39;s available for sale online.
Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&#39;s trip. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-17-marquette-alternative-high-school-photo-calendar-for-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.
The examples that come to mind share some common traits.
 there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-12-collaboration-and-community-leadership/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I just got done reading Francis Spufford&#39;s &quot;Red Plenty&quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.

It&#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few coffee shops that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the flyers collection lets you see what&#39;s on the bulletin boards around town. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-03-toledowiki-is-up-and-running/">&raquo;</a></p>
