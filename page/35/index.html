<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" /></a>I think I voted today.</p>
<p>I used the <strong>Automark</strong> machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&#39;ve used this machine before <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error.html" target="_self">many times</a>, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator.</p>
<p>The actual practice of voting went fine. It&#39;s a long ballot, and I went through all of the eleections, in some cases undervoting the ballot (see &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/10/bullet-voting-or-plunking-as-a-voting-strategy-in-pick-n-elections.html" target="_self">plunking</a>&quot;) and in other cases not voting at all when I didn&#39;t know anything about any of the candidates (my bad).&#0160;</p>
<p>The touch screen on the Automark device that I used didn&#39;t have perfect registration, and so every so often I&#39;d hit a button for one candidate adn it would mark the other one. You&#39;d think that you could design a screen so that the ballot &quot;hot spot&quot; for each candidate was further apart, don&#39;t you think? But I was careful and made sure to vote for the right candidate each time.</p>
<p>The first problem occurred as the ballot was being printed. The printer went kachunka-chunka and printed both sides of the ballot, but then it stopped with an error message to call an election official. The very nice election officials didn&#39;t know any more about the error message than I did, so we decided to pull the machine apart to extract the printed ballot, and if it turned out to be wrong to spoil it and start over. It came out OK, I double checked it and it was printed on both sides, so it looked right.</p>
<p>Next, time to insert it into the tabulator. Usually you insert the ballot into the tabulator from the top, right? But the tabulator wouldn&#39;t take the ballot. I then put it in backwards, and the machine accepted it. I just hope that it read it correctly.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a confidence-inspiring visit to the polling place.</p>

      <p><p>WNYC is running live California election results with data straight from the California Secretary of State. As part of that experiment I&rsquo;ve embedded their results page below. Note that this page will update throughout the night on Tuesday as election results come in, and that it&rsquo;s all unofficial results until the totals are certified.</p>
<p>If your screen is small enough (like mine) that the results are clipped, you can go to the <A href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/625.html">California election results map</a> page and see the whole thing. And, if you&rsquo;re interested in the code and the data behind this, you can find <A href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/data/election_data.json">2012 California election data in Javascript</a>, <a href="http://project.wnyc.org/election-2012-ca-results/data/election_jsonp.js">California 2012 election data in JSONP</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/wnyc/election_california_2012">the source code for the 2012 California election map</a> on Github.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Long Island Power Authority has not one but three maps showing power outages and restorations. I&#39;m not sure which is most informative. Each of these are from the evening of Saturday, November 3, 2012. Please click through to the page linked for current updates.</p>
<p>Some news that goes along with this:</p>
<p>Newsday, Tuesday November 6: &quot;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cuomo-blasts-delays-in-power-restoration-as-unacceptable-1.4191546" target="_self">Cuomo blasts delays in power restoration as &#39;unacceptable&#39;</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criticism of LIPA&#39;s outage map prompted the utility to produce a new format.</p>
<p>It came under intense heat and skepticism Monday after ratepayers noticed outages in their area were reported to be considerably smaller than they knew to be the case.</p>
<p>Hervey said LIPA sharply cut back the touted capability of the map to remove most interactivity, including restoration times in specific neighborhoods, and other details of outages, because the features weren&#39;t working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newsday, Monday Novmeber 5: &quot;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/new-storm-lipa-outages-gas-lines-frustrate-liers-1.4190867" target="_self">New storm, LIPA outages, gas lines frustrate LIers</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As he did last week, Cuomo expressed anger at utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The progress is unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that the utility companies have not performed adequately. The utilities are paid to provide service. They should have been prepared.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LIPA chief operating officer <strong>Michael Hervey</strong> on Sunday acknowledged a large backlog in uploading current information to the outage system. Crews are focused on work, he said, but LIPA is working harder to get the information current and accurate.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not enough for Pat Davis, who was forced to evacuate her&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;home because the family could not remain there with their 1-year-old as temperatures dropped below 50 degrees. She said the outage map shows only 1,000 outages in the neighborhood, but &quot;I do not know anybody south of&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;Road with power, as well as many north of Merrick Road without power.&quot;</p>

<p>A sign on the door of the large&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//National_Grid">National Grid</a>/LIPA complex on Mill Road read: &quot;This office is temporarily closed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/powerless-lipa-customers-frustrated-suspicious-of-numbers-1.4188048" target="_self">Newsday, Monday November 5:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LIPA was reporting that 263,000 customers remained without power as of Monday morning, down from the high of 945,000 a week ago. The number excludes around 30,000 customers in the Rockaway Peninsula,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Beach,_NY">Long Beach</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Atlantic_Beach,_NY">Atlantic Beach</a>, and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Fire_Island,_NY">Fire Island</a>&#0160;whose homes were so badly damaged they cannot take electric service.</p>
<p>The outage map, a critical link to many customers seeking information on their anticipated restoration time, has taken a skewering since the storm began. First it reported thousands more outages than some hamlets or villages had actual LIPA customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On day five of the largest outage in&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Island,_NY">Long Island</a>&#0160;history, LIPA received unprecedented levels of reinforcements -- 900 line workers from&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Canada">Canada</a>, Florida and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Arizona">Arizona</a>, some airlifted here with their equipment, according to Hervey. The flights were arranged by Gov. Andrew M.&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Andrew_Cuomo">Cuomo</a>&#0160;working with federal officials. The total workforce is now well over 3,100 workers.</p>
<p>LIPA spokesman Mark Gross said the number of workers in the field would be 4,300 by this morning, with another 1,000 being added by day&#39;s end, which would be more workers than any prior LIPA restoration effort.</p>

<p>This dramatic map shows areas where power is out (in red), where it has been restored (in blue), and where there was never a service interruption (in grey).

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Sandy hit the US East Coast earlier this week, knocking out power to more than 8 million subscribers. The damage to the infrastructure was so severe that it&#39;s expected to take more than a week to bring service back.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.</p>
<p><strong>NY Times</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/30/nyregion/new-york-power-outages.html" target="_self">tracking power outages and restoration for the Con Edison service</a>. They&#39;re pulling county by county data from the utility company web site and tracking and visualizing it over time. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/31/nyregion/where-the-power-is-out-and-returning.html" target="_self">More detailed reporting also covers surrounding states</a>, including hard-hit New Jersey and Long Island.

<p>Another tracker for Con Edison outage information has been done by Cameron Cundiff (@<a href="http://twitter.com/ckundo" target="_self">ckundo</a>) from Pivotal Labs.

<p>The &quot;Storm Center&quot; application from iFactor powers the web sites for a number of the larger utilities affected by Hurricane Sandy. In&#0160;<a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com/storm-center-put-to-the-test-during-sandy/">Storm Center put to the test during Sandy</a>, they discuss how the systems held up in the storm. Some&#0160;3,500,000 visits were logged to the mapping pages, and of those 20-50% were from mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>NYC Power Status</strong></p>

<p><strong>The trouble with utility outage tracking</strong></p>
<p>The hardest part about tracking utility outages across a broad area is that there&#39;s wide variety in how each utility reports outages. It would be useful to a lot of organizations to have a single map covering the whole storm area, but instead we have little pieces of a big picture.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m at Lou Rosenfeld&#39;s talk at the Michigan Union, with the title &quot;Beyond user research: Building an organizational brain&quot;. Notes below.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;You are not your user.&quot; The importance of talking to your users. The book &quot;Design of Everyday Things&quot;, 1986 as a watershed event. Everyone understands this now, so &quot;we won&quot;. But what does victory look like?</p>
<p>&#0160;Less of an information architect, more of an information therapist.</p>
<p>Reports from the user research group; information about site search analytics (in another group); logs from the call center (yet another group); reports from web analytics applications (yet another group); also &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; (survey research); CRM applications like Salesforce; papers from a research center; papers from the net; a &quot;mental model&quot; diagram; brand architecture research; net promoter score (survey research).</p>
<p>The problem: where&#39;s the insight in a situation that&#39;s completely siloed. Risk to &quot;user research&quot; work is that it&#39;s siloed away. If you collaborate you&#39;re &quot;the brain for the organization&quot;.</p>
<p>1. What vs. why.&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Quantitative vs qualitiative.</p>
<p>3. Organizational goals vs user goals.</p>
<p>4. Measure what you know vs. explore what you don&#39;t know. (Look for outliers, surprises, patterns.)</p>
<p>5. Statistical data vs. descriptive data.</p>
<p>How to succeed in getting user research to cooperate? Use data from other siloes. Examples: site search data from search logs; match persona with search log analysis; use analytics tools to frame questions about user behavior; field study + analytics combined.&#0160;</p>
<p>Example: query search for &quot;lost&quot; on Netflix.</p>
<p>How to get out of your silo: get out of your (physical) space; eat in the other cafeteria.</p>
<p>Boundary object: things that are common to a couple of fields. Linkages are connective areas of shared interest.</p>
<p>(The preso will be up in slideshare....these notes are incomplete of course)</p>
<p>Build a map - put the various interests on the map to generate the space that you can evaluate the various options.&#0160;</p>
<p>Stop using words - &quot;useless, misunderstood terms impede progress&quot;. Meaningless buzzwords, none of which involve solving problems.</p>
<p>Build a dashboard (a failed metaphor) which incorporates information across a number of separate siloes.&#0160;</p>

      <p><p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/24/weather-journal-storm-could-make-next-week-a-mess/" target="_self">Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name</a>.</p>

Most of the storm traffic is on #<a href="http://twitter.com/#sandy" target="_self">sandy</a>. </p>
<p>The other name for the storm is &quot;Frankenstorm&quot;, from the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd&amp;version=0&amp;fmt=reg" target="_self">Hydrometeorological Prediction Center</a>&#0160;extended forecast for Thursday, October 25, 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] These models are predicting that Sandy will get caught up by the trough approaching the Eastern U.S., which will inject a large amount of energy into the storm, converting it to a powerful subtropical storm with a central pressure below 960 mb and sustained winds of 60 - 70 mph. Winds of this strength would likely cause massive power outages, as trees still in leaf take out power lines. Also of great concern are Sandy&#39;s rains. Given that ocean temperatures along the Northeast U.S. coast are about&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at">5°F above average</a>, there will be an unusually large amount of water vapor available to make heavy rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy is now a category 1 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and central pressure of 970 hPa (see picture).&#0160; My community is all aflutter about this storm, particularly since our forecast models are&#0160;<strong>not&#0160;</strong>in agreement&ndash;some suggest the storm will intensify and head straight in to the Middle Atlantic coastline, some take it out to sea, and others move it out to sea before swinging it westward to hit New England or the Canadian maritimes.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?</p>
<p>I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;<a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-October/date.html" target="_self">outages</a>&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. One report of call failures listed the following cities:</p>
<pre>Cedar Rapids
Springfield, IL
Madison, WI
Green Bay, WI
Minneapolis
Sioux Falls
Omaha
Des Moines
Dubuque
Fargo
St. Louis
Davenport
Kansas City
Detroit

<p>as affected.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.</p>
<p>2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</p>
<p>3. Cast 4 votes, leaving none behind, and choosing one of the candidates you are opposed to to round out the ballot.</p>
<p>The strategy is called &quot;bullet voting&quot;, and it has some pros and cons which are neatly spelled out in this <a href="http://larrydavidson.blogspot.com/2005/09/bullet-voting-pro-and-con.html" target="_self">2005 blog post from Larry Davidson</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, to bullet-vote or not? The choice depends entirely on which scenario you think is more probable. If the race for fourth place is between your two favorite candidates, you should bullet-vote. If the race for fourth place is between your second choice and someone you strongly dislike, you should not bullet-vote. Maybe it’s not how they would handle it on&#0160;<em>Numb3rs,&#0160;</em>but math can’t give you a definite answer here.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullet voting is also known as &quot;plunking&quot;. The general case of voting systems being gamed by strategic voters is more common than you&#39;d expect, since it can give a coordinated minority the ability to decide an election over a disorganized majority.</p>

He&#39;s got a 1942 Jack Renie Street Guide of Los Angeles,&quot; [Glen] Creason said. &quot;He has four of the first Thomas Bros. guides from 1946. Those are very hard to find. The one copy we have is falling apart because it&#39;s been so heavily used. We had to photocopy it.&quot;</p>
<p>Creason was also enthralled by the discovery of several &quot;Mapfox&quot; Los Angeles street guides published in 1944. Creason said in his 32-year library career he had never seen one.</p>

      <p>I had my first chance to sit at the new Elixir Vitae cafe on East Liberty today. The store is one of two with that name, after the Cafe Ambrosia store on Maynard Street changed its name. (Same ownership, just a new name, because of conflicts with too many other coffee businesses called Ambrosia).</p>
<p>Some impressions:</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more sunshine in the new cafe than there ever was in the old one. Maynard is shaded by the parking structure and by Tower Plaza, but East Liberty has a nice south-facing window and light coming in.</p>
<p>The general ambiance is about the same, but not as many people have discovered the new cafe just yet. I&#39;m expecting it to eventually get something between a Main Street and a State Street sense to it, but for now, I was mostly alone in using the place for an extended typing session.</p>
<p>The local events bulletin board has a good selection to look at - it&#39;s not quite as big as the Maynard location, which has in my opinion one of the finest bulletin boards in town.</p>
<p>All in all a solid showing and a good new place to go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor City Council holds meetings twice each month, which are <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/communicationsoffice/ctn/meetingplace/Pages/TheMeetingPlace.aspx" target="_self">streamed online through the city&#39;s CTN network</a>. I tuned in last night on my laptop to listen and watch.</p>
<p>While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=typd" target="_self">a2council</a>&#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience. The running cmmentary made it easier to follow what was going on, and it served as a back channel to help make sense of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The council was working from an agenda that&#39;s in the <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com" target="_self">Legistar system</a>, and from time to time I&#39;d go back to that to see what the text of an agenda item was, to look at supporting materials, and see the detail.</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Chronicle does near-real-time news coverage as a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/category/civic-news-ticker/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker</a>, reporting out results from key votes and decisions during the meeting. This is brief coverage but important, and it sets the stage for their 10,000 word meeting reports that come out a week or so later.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a window open to <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a>, which has a local encyclopedia of information about what is going on in the city and the surrounding area. As council considered various options, I looked up what Arborwiki had to say about the current state of affairs, and updated it as best I could to reflect the meeting results and the news that was happening.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that watching this multi-connected stream was different from the experience of being in the same room as council. You miss the non-verbal communications, the body language, the hallway conversations that take place during breaks, and all sorts of in-person nuance. But for what it was, I&#39;m pretty happy with the experience. It felt like I was engaged with the meeting and could have a sense that I was part of the civic process.</p>

      <p>What we got:</p>

<p>Yellow beans - &quot;one more week of these&quot;</p>
<p>1/2 peck Rome apples. &quot;We lost 80% of the crop, only have 5 varieties instead of 20&quot;</p>
<p>Flat leaf parsley</p>
<p>Radishes</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes</p>
<p>Sweet red peppers</p>
<p>The market was busy and there was a full set of vendors under the covered awnings, but no one in the sand lot.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> is a local encyclopedia about the Ann Arbor area that anyone can edit. Up til now, it&#39;s been running on the same Mediawiki software that powers Wikipedia, but we&#39;re in the process of moving it to a new Localwiki instance.</p>
<p><a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a> is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California. The Localwiki software is especially good at handling maps, and so it should be that much easier to map out the streets and roads of Ann Arbor and surrounding Washtenaw County.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now also a new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/" target="_self">Facebook group</a> to discuss Arborwiki, which has been handy for sorting through restart visuals. I&#39;ll make sure to invite everyone who has touched the project so far to it.</p>
<p>In response to some questions:</p>
<p>The migration process has been relatively smooth so far, with about 10,000 pages moved in without much in the way of hand-editing things to patch them up. There&#39;s an importer for Mediawiki pages into Localwiki that handles a lot of the heavy lifting. We had to redesign the home page to take advantage of the new include file syntax, and there are some Mediawiki templates that I used for automatically generating links to news clippings that I&#39;ll have to reimagine. Localwiki founder Philip Neustrom has been a big help, and we&#39;re running on a Ubuntu instance that Ryan Eby at the Ann Arbor District Library spun up for us.</p>
<p>Not a lot of the Arborwiki pages had maps on them, so Philip wrote a little bit of custom code to make that happen more frequently by automatically recognizing some pages with addresses on them.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>
<p>In Lincoln, Nebraska, the library system is looking at spending $43 million on a new main downtown library. &quot;The study envisions a “21st century main library” with a café, 250-seat auditorium with green rooms, a black box theater, kitchen, Internet stations and larger adult, children and teen areas. There is no projected increase to the staff of 60.&quot; [<a href="http://watchdog.org/50875/pershing-center-could-become-a-new-library-for-43-million/" target="_self">Nebraska Watchdog</a>] The current library is more than 50 years old and needs &quot;costly updates&quot;.

<p>In Ann Arbor, Michigan, the library system has a ballot proposal that would fund a $65 million project to build a new downtown library. The library system FAQ envisions a &quot;21st century library building&quot; with a cafe, 400-seat auditorium, a grand reading room, expanded Internet production stations and a destination youth programming area.

<p><strong>Teachers</strong></p>
<p>Chicago teachers start their seventh day of a teachers strike Tuesday, as the city goes to court to try to end the strike on the grounds that it is illegal.

<p><strong>Sidewalks</strong></p>
<p>In 1888, an Ann Arbor City Council meeting was dominated by petitions from citizens for the city to put in sidewalks. In one case, a resident asked that a neighbor&#39;s dilapidated barn be torn down to make way for a sidewalk. [<a href="http://oldnews.aadl.org/node/93778" target="_self">Ann Arbor Argus</a> / Old News]</p>
<p>On Monday night, the Ann Arbor City Council meeting had an extended discussion of filling in the gaps in the city&#39;s sidewalk network. Council members noted several locations in their wards where students did not have a safe way to walk to school on sidewalks or a safe place to cross busy streets; others on council noted that the existing non-motorized transportation plan already addressed this and other issues. When it came to a vote, the proposal to study sidewalk gaps was turned down 6-5.
