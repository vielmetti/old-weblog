<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://750words.com">This system has you writing 750 words each day.
</a>
<p>
I&#39;ve already written 750 words today, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750-words-on-blogging-memory-and-forgetting-ive-been-blogging-for-a-long-time-and-writing-online-for-longer-than-that-27.html" target="_self">a long essay on blogging, forgetting, and remembrance</a>. It was pretty good, and I was pretty happy with it. At one point it was 830 words but I cut it down to size, removing a paragraph and tightening up a few phrases.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the 750 words site is to get you into a habit of writing that many words each and every day. It&#39;s not necessary to publish them, but simply to get them down onto the screen. The technique is similar to the &quot;<a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/" target="_self">morning pages</a>&quot; of The Artist&#39;s Way, but instead of pen and paper you type. By typing for long enough you get over the initial hurdle of getting anything down and instead start to get into a groove of reflection, introspection, creativity and insight. Or so that&#39;s the thought.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not certain that I can keep up with this over the long haul, but it&#39;s an appealing construct to have a simple-minded goal that&#39;s more productive than the alternative of playing solitaire, Flood It, or Sudoku. A Sudoku game eats up 20 minutes, which should be enough time to crank out most of a 750 word essay.
</p>
<p>
Hitting a precise word count improves my prose. I write something that&#39;s too long, and then use some extra time to omit needless words until the total is the correct size. &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/01/fill_the_input_.html" target="_self">Fill the input box exactly</a>&quot; is the mantra, and it serves two masters. First, it allows you to write quickly knowing full well that there will be words to cut when you&#39;re done. Second, it keeps the editorial role in abeyance until the whole piece has been worked to the end. It&#39;s better to cut words only when there are too many of them.
</p>
<p>
The 750 Words writing environment is spare. There&#39;s no formatting, no linking, no permalinks to worry about and no readers. It&#39;s just you on the page, typing away madly with the word count goal at the bottom right hand corner. Writer&#39;s block is the only barrier, and since there&#39;s no expectation of publication it doesn&#39;t even have to come out precisely right. Just keep typing until you are done with filling up the box.
</p>
<p>
I started to try to write an index to Vacuum as an exercise in organization, and what I found was that the tools I have for rereading the that text are too weak. What I really want to do is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/back_up.html" target="_self">download the whole stinking mess</a> and put it into some kind of file system that I can grep through. What words did I use, and when? Have I usefully repeated myself? Is there some clever phrase that gets used too much? All of that is easy enough to construct with the right text analysis environment, but very hard with just Google&#39;s searching tools at my disposal.
</p>
<p>
Organizing a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a>, especially an exceptionally varied one, is very hard work. I have a shelf full of paper notebooks dating back to the 1990s with words in them that perhaps deserve to be unearthed and reanimated for the net, but it&#39;s so hard to know without a very laborious process of reading through them one page at a time, puzzling out the inscriptions and deciding which would have been better forgotten. I know there&#39;s interesting work there mixed in with the sketches and the odd lists of people to call.</p>
<p>Twenty words to go.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, <a href="http://750words.com" target="_self">750 words</a> is a system which encourages you to write 750 words of disposable throwaway prose every day. If it turns out that you can reuse some of it, so much the better! I think this essay might have about 400 useful words in it, and I&#39;ll try to pull them out for Vacuum.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I ended up throwing away two whole paragraphs from the original edit of this essay, so the word count is only about 650. The time to edit the whole thing was almost as long as the time to write it.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>750 words on blogging, memory and forgetting</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently.</p>
<p>With over 2,000 posts in this Typepad installation I started to try to do an index. My writing here was ranged from recipes for semolina pudding to weather maps of Australia to accounts of a peanut processing plant in Texas. No single index is going to make any sense for all of that.</p>
<p>Even though I&#39;ve read a lot, and written a lot, I&#39;ve most likely forgetten most of what I&#39;ve ever written down. The temporary focus on a temporary enthusiasm carries through for a while and then gets discarded, saved but not readily at hand. After years of cumulative writing, what&#39;s there is not a single coherent whole ready to be sculpted into a neat linear narrative, but instead the sometimes interesting and sometimes fragmentary open notebook of a life lived near the keyboard.</p>
<p>Does writing help the memory? Certainly by writing things down you can cause them to be pinned down into a single tangible format that can be referred to later, and if you refer back to them often enough the transient interest becomes something concrete. There&#39;s a lot to be said for putting words down on paper so that they can be edited and refined so that there&#39;s something very particular that they say.</p>
<p>What is our memory these days? With the ubiquity of the Google and its all-seeing maw fed with the writings of our time, the strategy to memorize something may simply be to write it down in a place where it can be Googled and then search to refer back to it when it&#39;s needed.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Google’s maw is infinite and it will undoubtedly attempt someday to put every book ever written in every language into its digital coffers. - <a href="http://warrenadler.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-to-rescue.html" target="_self">Warren Adler</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeding Google is hardly a part-time task, and I feel a need to feed Twitter which is equally hungry to capture the short form version of contemporary accounts of our existence. Twitter is threatening to disgorge for our own personal use the collected record of our Twitter stream - every sandwich you ever ate, every time you complained about squeaky brakes on the bus, every poorly edited grumpy text mashed into the input box - and somehow certainly that will enter our personal memory space as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Forgetting is as important as remembering&quot; - <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/vacuum-0.html" target="_self">Brian Eno</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process of accumulating digital reminders of what we once experienced is occasionally punctuated by digital loss. There&#39;s the sudden catastrophic loss of the online system that dies with your words left stranded on it, or the hard drive that craters before all of the backups are done. There&#39;s also the slow loss of unfindability where the words or pictures still are somewhere, but you&#39;ve forgotten the magic incantation that will bring them onto the screen. I&#39;ve stranded some text of my own creation, hidden in the grand archives of the University, inaccessible to me or to anyone else because they are student records and thus off limits because of FERPA. No matter, I have remembered a few of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pop tarts and auto parts. - Michael Joyce</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every once in a long time, the words that you wrote long ago resurface. I wrote to Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 asking about home page design, and our correspondence was recently <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/home-page-design-advice-from-october-1991-3-months-after-the-webs-public-debut/266380/" target="_self">quoted in The Atlantic online.</a>&#0160;Aside from proving that I was there way back when, it reminded me that finding things online is an ongoing struggle, and that our puny screens and keyboards routinely fail us when looking for the answer to a complicated problem or to give us access to what we know is not very far away. The particular question was on home page design, and I know little more about it now than I did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>By writing I remember, and I throw a few more words into the big soup that try to draw on from time to time to recall what I am and what I know. I&#39;ve forgetten more than I&#39;ve ever remembered, and it&#39;s good to go rummaging through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/12/word_hoard.html" target="_self">word hoard</a> to see what can be unearthed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people.</p>
<p>In addition to ubiquity and focus, I&#39;d like to suggest a third axis of utility for social media - &quot;isolation&quot;. It&#39;s the notion that you can go somewhere online and do something special that&#39;s unlike anything else on the net, and that because of this the rules that have accreted over time about expected behavior are different.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[2]" />As an example, I have an account on <a href="http://pinterest.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Pinterest">Pinterest</a> that I use nearly exclusively for collecting maps. I don&#39;t follow all of my friends there, and I don&#39;t expect that people will follow me just because they are my friends. Similarly, a few friends have Plurk accounts in a little circle where no one expects that anyone else will read what they write and where there is a decided element of silliness that would not play on Facebook.<br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]" /><br id=".reactRoot[217].[1][2][1]{comment575633445785640_575968315752153}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[5]" />I think we all need a little corner of the net to call our own. Facebook ranks very low on the isolation scale and so it will not appeal to those who are looking for a quiet corner to express themselves. A lightly trafficked wiki, your own blog, or the carefully walled off corner of an interest-specific forum can all have that isolation factor that lets us be sociable but not to the entire world all at once.</p>

      <p>I'm struggling with the single user nature of this Android tablet. </p>

<p>My kids are complaining that they don't want all of the interruptions and notifications from the apps that I have installed. Frankly I agree with them, a Facebook window just popped up when I was writing this. </p>

<p>It would be easier if the front unlock screen was a real login screen.</p>

<p>The boys got D2 pads (<a href="http://d2pad.info" target="_self"><a href="http://d2pad.info">http://d2pad.info</a></a>) for Hanukah. Here&rsquo;s a 250 word long review of this 7&rdquo; Android tablet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&rsquo;t have much to compare against. The experience so far recommends it as a handy adjunct to a full-size computer for some tasks, and it makes me more confident in my hunch that an Android phone is going to be my next phone.</p>
<p>We ran into problems charging one of the devices, but helpful tech support fixed it. The D2 pad would not charge with the provided wall adapter, but it did charge just fine using a USB cable. I can&rsquo;t explain why.</p>
<p>The devices don&rsquo;t support the Google Play store. I find myself mostly using the Amazon App Store, which appears to be a credible alternative. I&rsquo;m sticking to free apps for the moment; the favorite so far is Swype, an alternative keyboard.</p>
<p>The camera on the device grainy even in good light, and it takes crappy photos in low light. It would be fine for a low resolution video chat.</p>
<p>The touch screen is surprisingly good for such an inexpensive device. On one of the two units, we found that there was a small defect where it appeared that one corner of the screen was being pressed down on continuously; that seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>I wish the device allowed true multiple user operations. #2 son is getting tired of having my Google calendar alerts show up on his screen.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>One of the pads now has a cracked screen, after someone got a bit frustrated with it. It still functions just fine. The funky defect on the corner of the screen never really did go away.</p>
<p>The Android operating system environment gets an enthusiastic thumbs up from the more vigorous user of the system, who is looking forward to the day when he gets better hardware to work with. He&rsquo;s showed me all sorts of fun things including an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ytremote" target="_self">Android based remote control for Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The boys are getting used to seeing Papa&rsquo;s Twitter show up from time to time on their screens, and #1 son is looking forward to the day when he&rsquo;s old enough to get his own Twitter account.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.</p>
<p>The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.</p>
<p>Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. The Canton District Library does have an installation of LibraryThing for Libraries, their OPAC integration product, which lets you check availability of a book straight from LibraryThing. The lack of a direct link means that to find a book in the AADL that I have on my screen in LibraryThing I have to click a few more times. I suppose that&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to tag and categorize books that you don&#39;t own yourself, but only have collected them from the library? There was a time when I tagged things everywhere I found them - photos on Flickr, web sites on Delicious - but these days that doesn&#39;t seem so important. I like seeing other people&#39;s tags, especially for works that are unfamiliar, but it hardly seems essential to do it for my own use unless there&#39;s some list I&#39;m trying to put together. When did tagging cease being fun?</p>
<p>I&#39;m spending some of my time on the site deleting books that I no longer even remember having read or that I no longer wish to remember. That should result in better recommendations, and maybe a chance to reread something that would have been worth remembering. My use of the site peaked in 2008 so there&#39;s not as much recent coverage as I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>The recommendations from LibraryThing are really quite good, and they are even better for reflecting which of the books you&#39;ve already read. The site generates ten recommendations based on other people&#39;s reading patterns, and it reminds you that you&#39;ve read some of the ones on that list with a checkmark.</p>
<p>I wish I read more books and fewer web pages.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. </p>
<p>I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way.</p>
<p>I weary of scanning the net looking for the next space to insert a little bit of pithy commentary. Write long to find some free space to wander around in and write on and then edit before it is launched out into the world. If there are pithy bits buried inside, so much the better - but the goal is not to string together a sequence of quips and quotes but instead to explore a possibility space and bump up against some creative edges.</p>
<p>Writing long is a contemplative activity. Sort through the main theme and find other related ideas to explore. A short paragraph invites adding an extra sentence in the middle to clarify, expound, or to share some added insight. Allow space to type in to allow for some wandering through the world of ideas without necessarily having to come&#0160;to the point right away.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the wandering in your own thought-space that is appealing, even if you decide for the sake of the reader that you need to eventually trim a paragraph that doesn&#39;t fit. Write that extra paragraph in order to get to the good paragraph that awaits after it&#39;s been written. Write some extra words so that your inner editor has something to improve at the end of the effort. Adding in more words lets you explore a variety of turns of a phrase, and the slow process of selecting from multiple alternatives may suggest additional lines of reasoning. &#0160;Surplus words are there for a purpose, even though their purpose may only be to be removed.</p>
<p>The careful slow process of editing works better when there&#39;s a lot to start from. It&#39;s not enough to have the right words; they have to be in the right order. Collecting lots of words give you a chance to sift through them with a clear eye after the original collection is made, and pull out the better ones and leave some others for a later time. In the process of doing this, you might end up rewriting the same phrase multiple times. Keep trying until the suitable phrase emerges, and then collect up the debris that remains around it to see if there&#39;s one more thing you wanted to say.</p>
<p>Editing is a process of adding or deleting words to meet a set of constraints. If you have too many words in a sentence, too many sentences in a paragraph, or too many paragraphs on the page, the constraint leads you to omit needless words. If the page is empty and you have a goal to fill it up, the need is to expand, augment, and add to the words on the page - even if you have some eventual hope of hitting a word limit which will motivate you to trim back the extra verbiage. Once you have hit your word count, there&#39;s a balance point where every extra word demands that another word be removed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been ruminating over the phrase &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, which stems from Stuart Kauffman who useds it to think about the world of evolutionary biology. The world builds on what it has, and the more aware we are of all of the possibilities in our world the more adjacent opportunities can present themselves. From the perspective of writing, the adjacent possible word is every word that could be added or subtracted from a partially finished work to make it better.&#0160;</p>
<p>This lends itself to thinking about writing via the adjacent possible. Get some words out on the page, and then use that as your raw materials to remix, rework, or rearrange until you have something better than the original. In your first draft, don&#39;t obsess about getting every sentence perfect. Use the initial writing effort as a chance to explorate some phrases and to try out a few unfamiliar terms of art. Write some extra words, so that you can delete them later.&#0160;</p>
<p>If I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you a thousand times: repetition is the very soul of the net. If you have a good idea, why say it only once? Repeat it over and over again in different guises until your reader is thoroughly struck through with the notion. Say it, change a word, and say it once again. Delete words to make room for others that are better.</p>
<p>The slow process of accumulating words takes time. If you are fortunate, you start out with a set of ideas that allows for exploration of a variety of perspectives and alternatives, and a structure that gives you some guidance for what comes first and what happens next. Even a mechanical exploration of that possibility space can generate the necessary length of a first draft that works to reach the distance, with a few extra words to spare that can be trimmed later. Keep writing until you discover what it is that you should have been focusing on from the first, so that you can go back later and carve out the good parts for more prominent display.</p>
<p>At some point, the page is full, and it&#39;s time to bring the exploration to an end. You have more than your fair allotment of words, and it&#39;s time to cut, not add. The extra words that you drop out are scaffolding, the extra space that you built in order to find the permanent space that you really wanted. Even if the total is over what you had originally planned to write, count on the process of addition by subtraction and carve out the good words from the big pile that you have built.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means.</p>
<p>The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that.</p>
<p>What I think it might mean is working with my todo list - <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">which is currently in a github issue tracker</a> - and approaching it in an associative fashion rather than going strictly linearly through it. The goal is to make progress on a variety of things, but not necessarily to work down one long deterministic ordered list. I&#39;ve organized my github list so that pretty much everything has a tag or two, and thus I can turn a 100-long list into a 10-long list and crunch through it without it feeling infinite.</p>
<p>
Ideally you find yourself in a situation where there are a few easy things that have been languishing for a while that right now you just know that you can do, so you get up from your computer and you do them. This works especially well when you&#39;ve salted away some easy, but not for now tasks into the list so that they can get done at some impromptu opportune moment.</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that this approach to self-tasking is related to the concept of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/04/marginally_usef.html" target="_self">structured procrastination</a>. My 2005 self had the idea that it was good to write things down that you weren&#39;t ready to do just yet, so that you could randomly (!) generate suggestions that would be productive when you had some down time that you weren&#39;t ready to focus on the big things.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&#39;s trip.</p>
<p>I asked Cindy DePetro from MAHS about the calendar and the responses they&#39;ve gotten from it. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to get praised over the quality of the photos, but our biggest praise is that most people feel like they receive a little piece of home when they see our calendars. We get many repeat customers, and our calendars travel all over the world. Thus far, we know they are being sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany and China.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while I try to organize my life. Usually the effort is temporary, with one system working really well as I download all of my tasks out of my inbox and into it, and then slowly languishing until it fails for some mysterious reason to actually get me to do things more efficiently.</p>
<p>You only need to look at my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/productivity/" target="_self">productivity</a> category here to marvel at how ideas come and go.</p>
<p>The latest approach to this, with a test time of all of three days before I write about how wonderful it is, is to use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_self">github</a> as an issue tracker. Now it helps that I&#39;m also using github as an issue tracker for a couple of other projects, so it&#39;s not a big learning curve, and the more familiar I get with the tool the better off I suspect I&#39;ll be.</p>
<p>Issues in github look more or less like items in a conferencing system that has single threaded conversations. The title of the issue is the most searchable part of it, so it pays to have good titles. Each issue can refer to other issues by number (e.g. #4) so you don&#39;t have to worry that renaming an issue forces you to update links. Issues can be in exactly one milestone, and milestones have due dates which you are reminded about. Issues also have one or more categories and the categories are color coded.</p>
<p>I&#39;m approaching this along the lines that the traditional &quot;inbox zero&quot; or &quot;get things done&quot; approach wants to have it work - your inboxes, all of them, stay as empty as they can all of the time, and the big long issue tracker list is the semi-infinite comprehensive list of everything there is to do. You work your way through that list using some subset of it to prompt activity, and you tick off tasks as completed when they&#39;re eventually done. Anything that comes into an empty inbox gets dispatched promptly so that the inbox stays empty, but you don&#39;t and can&#39;t do everything on your todo list at once.</p>
<p>So far so good? The cost is non-zero, which means that if I decide to give up on this I have the motivating force of a few dollars a month to either prod me into action or use as a budget for some other tool. At worst I get better at using github for a while.</p>

      <p><p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.</p>
<p>The examples that come to mind share some common traits.</p>
<ol>
<li>there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other</li>
<li>for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least.</li>
<li>the successful communicator is good at more than one network and can move between them, pulling ideas and people along for the ride.</li>
<li>somewhere at the center of the network there&#39;s a culturally appropriate publication process that generates an external memory of what has been communicated, whether that&#39;s a ritual behavior, a database, something like a wiki, or some book or printed artifact.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that if you can manage to satisfy all four of these factors that you can get alongwith a wide range of technologies. The working amateur radio clubs that I know fit the bill,&#0160;as do some networks that are coordinated by prolific bloggers or that have sprung up&#0160;around civic wikis.</p>
<p>The thing that emerged from writing this was realizing that ritual behavior could be the&#0160;external memory that you get from community leadership, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily&#0160;need to be written down. Just knowing that there&#39;s some component of a community that&#0160;gathers in an orderly way regularly and that follows a pattern that&#39;s not much different&#0160;from the time before, that&#39;s a powerful synchronizing pulse that can feed all sorts of&#0160;other informal collaboration.</p>
Thanks to Kevin Doyle Jones for the conversation that led to this.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I just got done reading Francis Spufford&#39;s &quot;Red Plenty&quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.</p>
<p>Some other reviews of the work, so that I don&#39;t miss them:</p>
<p>Jo Walton: <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/the-glorious-terrible-strange-ussr-francis-spuffords-red-plenty" target="_self">The Glorious, Terrible, Strange USSR: Francis Spufford’s&#0160;<em>Red Plenty</em></a></p>
<p><em>It’s not SF. It’s not really&#0160;<em>fiction</em>, though it’s not non-fiction either. It’s something strangely between the two, a fictionalised non-fiction book about the Soviet Dream. Reading it partakes of some of the pleasures of reading especially geeky SF, and some of the pleasure of reading solid well-written nonfiction on a fascinating subject. It’s about history, economics, how technology and ideology interact, and how theory and practice are different, with examples. What it’s most like is reading an extended version of one of Neal Stephenson’s more adorable infodumps, only with footnotes and a proper end.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>Crooked Timber put together a <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RedPlenty.pdf" target="_self">Red Plenty reader</a> with about a dozen essays.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2010/08/red_plenty_by_f.shtml" target="_self">Adam Roberts writes in Strange Horizons</a>, a science fiction review:</p>
<p><em>To take the first first. When people talk about &quot;science fiction&quot; the science they are thinking of (as it might be) physics, or chemistry, or perhaps biology. But that&#39;s a narrow way of taking things. The science in&#0160;<cite>Red Plenty</cite>&#0160;is economics, and reading the book will teach you a tremendous amount about the logic (and illogic) of running a planned economy on the Soviet scale. The speculative portion of the science here is the striking attempt by Vitalevich and Nemchinov to modify the catastrophically inflexible Soviet economic model with a mechanism—&quot;shadow prices&quot;—better able to match supply to demand without simply instituting Capitalist &quot;free&quot; markets. Perhaps it sounds dry, but I found it fascinating, and precisely as science-fictional as a proposed new spaceship drive or cloning technology.</em></p>

      <p>See <a href="http://www.toledowiki.net" target="_self">toledowiki.net</a>&#0160;for a city wiki for Toledo, Ohio. As of this writing it has 113 users, who have created 362 pages about the city.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Coffee_Shops" target="_self">coffee shops</a> that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Flyers" target="_self">flyers</a> collection lets you see what&#39;s on the bulletin boards around town.</p>
<p>My working knowledge of Toledo is bounded by the few places that I routinely visit - the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Museum_of_Art" target="_self">art museum</a>, the ball field where the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Mud_Hens" target="_self">Mud Hens</a> play, and a few routine stops along the freeway near the turnpike exit. It&#39;s incredibly helpful to have a local guide to the whole rest of the town to make it possible to think about alternative destinations the next time I visit.</p>

<p>Hi, folk!<br /><br />Yesterday saw a decent sized group for lunch, roughly a dozen.&#0160;Conversation was, as usual, fascinating and diverse.<br /><br />General conversation included the search for a proper formalmythological &quot;Muse&quot; or Goddess as a kind of patron saint of geeks and&#0160;code monkeys. A suggestion was Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of<br />measurement, mathematics, and librarianship, known for her&#0160;seven-pointed headdress and leopardskin dress.<br /><br />&lt;<a href="http://www.egyptianmyths.net/seshat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.egyptianmyths.net/seshat.htm</a>&gt;<br />&quot;Seshat carried many titles, such as &quot;Lady of Builders&quot;, &quot;Mistress of&#0160;the House of Books&quot;, and &quot;Foremost in the Library&quot;.&quot;<br />&lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seshat.svg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seshat.svg</a>&gt;<br /><br />Also mentioned was a recommendation for the book, &quot;War of Art.&quot;<br />&lt;<a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/" target="_blank">http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/</a>&gt;<br /><br />Main question focused on upcoming events, where to have events, and&#0160;&quot;December-y-type stuff&quot;.<br /><br />Upcoming Events:<br /><br />- Ed&#39;s birthday (see y&#39;all next week!)<br />- Kiwanis sale Fri-Sat 9-12<br />- Workantile makers fest - January; Show and tell for makers<br />- Xmas movies at Michigan Theater free on ...

      <p>My friend Dan <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/" target="_self">KB6NU</a>&#0160;was network control for the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umarc/net/net.html" target="_self">W8UM net</a> tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern&#0160;(145.230 MHz, -600 kHz shift, 100 Hz PL). This was my first try at being on for the net, and so I waited patiently until my radio started making noises other than static.</p>
<p>After most everyone else checked in, I hit the transmit button and gave my call sign (KD8OQG) and was acknowledged by Dan.&#0160;</p>
<p>Among other things discussed tonight:</p>
<p>The Amateur Radio Relay League&#39;s <a href="http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world" target="_self">Logbook of the World</a>;<br />Where to get amateur radio gear in Hawaii, for someone traveling there;<br />The Monday, November 19 2012 performance of the <a href="http://www.music.umich.edu/special_programs/youth/mye/MYEsymphonyorch.htm" target="_self">Michigan Youth Symphony Orchestra</a> at Hill Auditorium.&#0160;</p>
<p>I mostly listened, but it was an enjoyable hour spent, and it&#39;s always good to tune in to a good discussion.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The new Consumers Energy Power Outage map is at&#0160;<a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap" target="_self">http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap</a>. Here&#39;s a map with the service territory marked - there are no outages to speak of on the map right now. The page automatically switches to a mobile web view if you are coming from a smart mobile device (IOS and Android; not so much Blackberry). There are three views: one for individual detailed outages, one at a city level, and one at a county level. According to the webinar I&#39;m listening to now, the detailed outages are running in real time, and the city/county overview is delayed up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>For the media, this augments but does not replace the existing direct contacts to Consumers Energy public relations representatives who can answer questions.</p>
<p>For storms in Michigan that come from west to east, it will be useful to watch to see how badly the storm affects Consumers before it gets to Detroit Edison territory.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards.</p>
<p>I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month.
</p>

<p><blockquote>I am responding to your request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act received November 6, 2012 for a copy of monthly logs of confiscated signs for 2012. Your request is granted.  The number of confiscated signs for the 2012 year to date is 285.  The number if signs collected each month of this year is as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>January - 37 <br />February - 41 <br />March - 23 <br />April - 55 <br />May - 65 <br />June - 82 <br />July - 63 <br />August - 114 <br />September - 34 <br />October - 206 <br />November to date - 105</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s certainly a followup request that tries to go deeper into detail for each of these sign confiscations, but what I thought was interesting was the definite connection between the political season and the number of signs taken down.</p></p>
