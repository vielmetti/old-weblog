<h2 id="things-yet-to-do-in-this-weblog-setup:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Things yet to do in this weblog setup:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs etc</li>
</ul>

      <p>Some sources for information on the Duck Lake Fire, which started on Wednesday, May 23, 2012 and is burning rapidly in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_County%2C_Michigan" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Luce County, Michigan">Luce County</a>, north of Newberry, MI. The fire is dangerous and has caused evacuations; if you are reading this and you are in the area, seek authoritative and current information from official sources.</p>
<p>The fire brings to mind the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/08/fire-maps-for-t.html" target="_self">2007 Sleeper Lake Fire</a>&#0160;which burned over 18,000 acres in Luce County.&#0160;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#0160;At this point, the Duck Lake Fire area is 55 percent contained.</p>
<p>The latest estimate on structure loss is that there are 138 properties within the perimeter of the fire; 115 sites have been inspected to this point, with 23 sites remaining. Inspections are ongoing, and it is anticipated that they will be completed today. A total of 115 structures have been lost.</p>

<p>8:00 pm Tuesday, May 29 map. From the DNR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Duck Lake Fire team really needs to hear from people who have property located within the fire area (especially those property owners that may be out of state). U.P. residents call 211; all others call 800-338-1119. Please give your name, fire number and road, and contact info so we can provide updates as damage assessments are completed. (Folks who&#39;ve already called and provided fire number and road name do NOT need to call again.)&#0160;<br /><br /></p>

Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">Facebook</a> and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful.</p>
<p>With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo. With a hefty 40 plus pages of end notes and indexing, there was hardly a page of the work that didn&#39;t echo someone else&#39;s thoughts.</p>
<p>With everything so carefully indexed and footnoted, I thought I&#39;d skip to the chase and see if the earliest arguments against technology in thought and human relations were also there. In The <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Phaedrus-Plato/dp/0872202208%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0872202208" rel="amazon" target="_blank" title="Phaedrus">Phaedrus</a>, Plato relates argument the argument of Socrates that writing is a technology which leads to a diminishing of intelligence and of understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soc. I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves. (<a href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm" target="_self">Plato, The Phaedrus</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keen doesn&#39;t quote from Plato, but he does credit himself a &quot;celebrated public speaker&quot;. It&#39;s important that someone have a reasonable criticism of today&#39;s social networks, just so we can understand them better <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">when they inevitably change or fail</a>. This particular text probably reads better as an ebook, with all of its carefully collected citations linked; it might, like the example of Phaedrus, be even better in person delivered by the speaker who can vary his answer to incorporate the changes of the day and defend his thoughts.</p>
<p>A good book for an airplane ride, or a good ebook for a contrarian romp through modern social networks hype or to congratulate yourself for missing the Facebook IPO.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m in the midst of a job hunt, and so I expect that people I talk to who don&#39;t know me very well will take a look at this weblog as part of the things they look for when trying to assess who I am or to help prepare them to make small talk as a part of discussion. This is a good and useful reason to write in a weblog, to make yourself easy to strike up a conversation with.</p>
<p>As blogs go, Vacuum is relatively old school in that it deals with everything and nothing - you&#39;ll find dozens of categories, ranging from strawberry picking to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/power-outage-mapping.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="Power Outage Mapping">power outages</a> to seasonal holidays to technical discussions in a variety of fields. If it looks like a somewhat eclectic notebook, that&#39;s because it is. At various times when the need has arisen I&#39;ve pulled out separate weblogs to corral related information together. Superpatron, for innovation in library systems, was the one that really took off to have a life of its own for a while. When I wrote for AnnArbor.com, a weekly column on <a class="zem_slink" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/foia-jobs-looking-for-all-of-your-ideas-on-foiachat.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="FOIA jobs: looking for all of your ideas on #FOIAchat">FOIA</a> had enough cohesion to look like a body of work and not just a collection of ephemeral interests.</p>
<p>When you create a resume crafted for a particular job, you emphasize the particular skills and abilities you have and by keeping it brief you remove a whole set of other things. When you blog voraciously over a decade, you collect a whole lot of things that look temporarily interesting but sometimes - perhaps more than sometimes - just turn out to be interesting of the moment.</p>
<p>So, hi. You&#39;re reading this. There&#39;s a lot here, if you search. If you ask about anything, there&#39;s probably more to be said. I assume that you&#39;ll understand if there&#39;s some things here that look unfinished, because that&#39;s by design.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Imagine that it&#39;s the year 2020; it&#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?</p>
<p><em>Something new</em></p>
<p>One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a perpetual demand for new means of expression online, and a perpetual supply of people trying to build an &quot;eyeball business&quot; to service that quest for novelty. The newness can express itself as exclusivity, or as a better way to share photographs, or by removing features that other systems take for granted. Whatever it is, the barriers for creating Yet Another Social Network Service are low.</p>
<p><em>Advertising may not sustain growth</em></p>
<p>A second possibility is that Facebook makes some same mistake that Myspace does of creating too much advertising inventory that&#39;s worth too little per use, and that marketing people and advertising people move their budgets elsewhere because they can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) want to prove their results. General Motors decided that both Facebook ads and Super Bowl ads were of little use, and they might be the harbinger of a bigger trend.</p>
<p>As communications systems grow, there are more and more pieces of them where no one has designed an ad specifically to target the niche that&#39;s being expressed in that one piece of online behavior. You thus end up with a huge inventory of space that has to be filled with something, and a need to create that supply of advertisers who don&#39;t really care where that ad goes as long as it&#39;s frequent.</p>
<p><em>The dream of the public internet</em></p>
<p>The Internet purist would hope that Facebook is displaced by open protocols and public interfaces, rather than private APIs. This is also the hope of every development team with a set of bright ideas unwilling to tether themselves to someone else&#39;s system.</p>
<p>The history of the public internet has been expansive growth at times (Usenet news, the World Wide Web) alternated with periods where the money and attention flowed into walled gardens (Compuserve, AOL). Facebook is more like AOL than it is like Usenet, and since it has to build all of its infrastructure it&#39;s at risk from innovative internetworked distributed systems where many people can play.</p>
<p>Usenet died of its own weight, overrun by success, by AOL users, and by spam and pornography. The Web spawned a whole series of mostly open systems, but really never reinvented Usenet in its pure form of distributed discussion groups where everyone you&#39;d want to talk to on every possible subject is always online. The net might just be too big to have something other than central control decisions make for orderly governance.</p>
<p><em>Mobile turns the tables</em></p>
<p>Finally, it&#39;s quite plausible that as more of our Internet time is absorbed in mobile devices that no one will figure out quickly how to take enough money from that particular set of users vs. the big-screen computer users who have lots of on-screen space for ads.</p>
<p>Imagine there&#39;s no Facebook; it&#39;s easy if you have a long memory back to eight years ago. There&#39;s some arc that innovative online systems go through from early adopter to mainstream to old news. A lot of new systems will try to capture our attention, our friendships, and our willingness to pay over the rest of the decade, and the network of 2020 will not simply be a bigger version of the net of 2012.</p>

<p>Ad Age Digital reports on <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/google-a-ghost-town-brands-decamp-pinterest/234867/">brand marketing and its fickle treatment of Google+</a> as newcomer Pinterest takes up reader and advertiser interest:</p>
<blockquote>Google+ launched brand pages six months ago, introducing new social lingo, including &quot;hangouts,&quot; &quot;circles&quot; and &quot;+1s.&quot; But strike up a conversation with a digital marketer these days, and talk of &quot;+1s&quot; has been replaced by that of &quot;pins.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/07/rushkoff.facebook.myspace/?hpt=Sbin ">2011 piece by Douglas Rushkoff</a> spells out the &quot;we&#39;ve seen it before&quot; attitude of other social networks and their short term success:</p>
<blockquote>If you were there for Compuserve, AOL, Tripod, Friendster, Orkut, MySpace or LinkedIn, you might have believed the same thing about any one of those social networks. Remember when those CD Roms from AOL came in the mail almost every day? The company was considered ubiquitous, invincible. Former AOL CEO Steve Case was no less a genius than Mark Zuckerberg.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/08/was-it-google-who-killed-myspace/">GigaOm in 2011 on Google and Myspace</a> and poor quality advertising:</p>
<blockquote>Think back to 2006: That’s when they signed the $900 million, three-year advertising deal to turn Google into Myspace’s exclusive providers of text ads and search. It was a great cash prize for Murdoch’s purchase, but actually ended up being a weight around its neck. The deal’s targets required Myspace to crank up page views and increase already-heavy advertising space at precisely the same moment that Facebook was pushing forward with a clean and easily-understood design.</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The problem of poor quality advertising on Facebook is noted in the context of <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57437885-71/how-zuckerbergs-wedding-reveals-facebooks-problem/">constipation ads on Zuckerberg&#39;s wedding announcement</a> by Chris Matyszczyk of CNET.</p>
<blockquote>If ads for heart attacks and constipation on its most important page of celebration are anything to go by, the company has a long, long way to go in order to even begin to make advertising work. May I wish the happy couple all the wealth, um, happiness in the world. I hope as they log on to Facebook this morning to view all the good wishes, they aren&#39;t being served with ads for divorce lawyers, marriage guidance counselors and, um, investment advisers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>increased user access to and engagement with Facebook through our mobile products, where we do not currently directly generate meaningful revenue, particularly to the extent that mobile engagement is substituted for engagement with Facebook on personal computers where we monetize usage by displaying ads and other commercial content;</blockquote>

<p>This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.</p>
<p>For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. Since I can see just fine, I wasn&#39;t able to tell if the audio instructions were perfect, but they seemed pretty good and straightforward.</p>
<p>After my encounter with the poll worker, I went to city hall to give the election officials a report on what had happened. The person I talked to at city hall pulled out a guide to poll workers (from 2008) and did not immediately find specific instructions one way or the other about using the Automark, but we didn&#39;t read every page.</p>

<p>What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it.</p>
<p>A proposal was put forth to not spend the money on art and to renovate some bathrooms in the building instead. This left a missed opportunity to instead ready-made art as part of that installation. (photo: wikimedia commons, from the original photo by Alfred Stieglitz).</p>

<p><strong>Off I Go To The County Board,</strong><br /><em>inspired by Mary Morgan</em></p>
<p>Off I Go To The County Board,<br />To hear the rabble bray,<br />Of taxes met, infractions scored,<br />On this harumphing day.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar characteristics of writing for yourself and not just creating copy is that you end up finding things from your past that you still own enough to re-edit and rework as needed. A recent discussion on Twitter about paw paws helped me unearth <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/papaws-the-mich.html" target="_self">a 2008 collection of scrapbook entries about the fruit, its names, and how it tastes.</a>&nbsp;If I had produced this content for an employer (or an ex-employer), it would be long since frozen and old; but because it's just my writing, I can go back and make it better four years later.</p>
<p>I've been happy with Typepad for a long time. Recently, some of the management changes at the organization that runs it have led to some changes in the marketing around the service, so that the relatively few old-school bloggers like me still on the system seem less and less to be the target audience, in favor of professional media people who have a certain number of words of content that they are obligated to produce before they move to the next task. I guess I can only be hopeful that the sorts of tools that are needed to crank out content on the job can also be used for old fashioned blogging where the deadlines are less definite and the goals more ambiguous.</p>

The paw paw discussion came and went on Twitter, as twitter things tend to do, without leaving too much of an obvious trace; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MickiMaynard/status/196658685341220864" target="_self">Micki Maynard</a> and Dave Askins were at the center of it.

<p>In 2011, the number of workers belonging to a union in Michigan was 671,000, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported [on&#0160;Monday, April 9, 2012]. Regional Commissioner Charlene Peiffer noted that union members accounted for 17.5 percent of wage and salary workers in Michigan in 2011 compared to 16.5 percent a year earlier. At its peak in 1989, the first year state data were available, Michigan’s union membership rate was 26.0 percent.

<p>David Erdody, a digital curator at the Bentley Historical Library, discovered a series of 20 photo negatives in early January that feature King giving a speech and hosting a discussion at the University. These photographs, which have never been printed or published, depict King speaking and greeting a crowd at Hill Auditorium, attending a small discussion in the Michigan Union and having dinner at the University on Nov. 5, 1962.</p>

<p>In our new building, paint is going onto the walls. The reading nooks looking out onto the courtyard are warm with color. The sun comes in through the huge windows and skylights, and every way you look there are views to the trees outside. The flexible learning spaces - the common areas, breakout spaces, front porches for the classrooms, the open library space - are everything I hoped they would be. The music and drama studio, the science lab, the art room, the classrooms; they are all spacious, bright, gorgeous places. Soon they will be alive with children and the hum of projects and great ideas.&#0160;<br /><br /></p>
