      <p>Some maps of South Sudan, which is in the news today because of an emerging civil war.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unocha.org/south-sudan/">UNOCHA South Sudan</a> describes the displaced persons in South Sudan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.</p>

<p>Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers.</p>

<p>A useful mechanism of self-guidance for me is to ensure that every post fits into at least one existing category. It doesn't help that I have to date created <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/archives.html">two hundred and thirty eight categories</a> into which something might fit. That at least is honest; this weblog doesn't have one narrow focus, and it's been running for ten years, so some divergence of interests is not just anticipated but expected.</p>

<p>For an illustration of the simplicity of this approach, see Dan Cooney's painting "The Simplicity of the Semantic Web". (All rights reserved, used with permission.)</p>

      <p>Toronto, Ontario is coated in ice tonight. A severe winter ice storm slowing the city to a slippery crawl, with widespread power outages. It's a city in crisis.</p>

<p>Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it's a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford.</p>

<p>So, given the need for crisis communications, who do you turn to in a pinch? Hopefully it would be the Mayor, but in the absence of a functioning Mayor, you turn to the Twitter account that pokes fun at the Mayor. @<a href="http://twitter.com/ToMayorFrod">MayorRobFrod</a> has been tweeting out news of power outages, transit service updates, warming centres, flight delays, and other emergency management info. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" title="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The map shows intensity of the ice storm on a scale from 0 (little impact) to 5 (catastrophic damage). The index incorporates measures of rainfall (as ice), wind, and temperatures to come up with an aggregate measure. Washtenaw County's forecast is a 0, but to the north (Livingston) and west (Jackson) counties there are chances for more severe icing. The forecast gives the worst hit to upstate New York along Lake Ontario; alas this map does not show Canadian forecasts, but <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/21/severe-weather-warnings-sweep-across-all-of-central-and-eastern-canada-travel-threatened/">news accounts</a> predict severe weather in Toronto as well.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.</p>

<p>For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. That's why when a proper obituary is written I like to cut and paste it out of wherever it has been and post it here. It seems that unless you do that the words so carefully and lovingly written disappear, either into the unsearchable maw of Facebook or into the tattered yellow clippings of a typical newspaper obituary site. You'll see a few of them in the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/obituaries">obituaries</a> category here.</p>

<p>I've written previously about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/07/facebook-and-obituaries.html">Facebook and obituaries</a>, so this is more a reminder and a capture of a few thoughts than something earth-shakingly new. I have to wonder how the net will evolve over time and whether some hip new service of the moment will transform into something that people use to share their time of grief.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I use <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> (see: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html">previously</a>) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the projects pile up, and I forget what I was doing but still don't know what to focus on. The mindfulness project then is to go methodically through each of the tabs, dealing with whatever is on that page and then closing the tab instead of saving it. This has been a good way to feel like I don't have an infinite set of half-done efforts.</p>

<p>This map (one of many on the site) shows the overlap of what people map out when they say they are from Detroit. The densest is the downtown region only; the most generous encompasses a 9-county region. From Alex B.

<blockquote>
  <p>I chose to look at the first 100 images that appeared in a Google image search for “map of Detroit” and overlay the results. Many corporations based in Southfield, Warren, or Dearborn choose to say they are based in “Detroit,” Likewise, most regional organizations (Detroit Chamber, Detroit Water &amp; Sewage, SEMCOG, etc.) represent Detroit with boundaries that extend into surrounding municipalities, most commonly the tri-counties (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb). A number of the 100 maps show urban sprawl to varying degrees while some maps categorize municipalities around the city as “Detroit.” Some maps even included parts of Windsor, Ontario in the “metro Detroit” area. The larger boundaries match the Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as outlined by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which represent “Detroit” as either a 6 county area (MSA) or a 9 county area (CSA).</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4693">Talking to Vula</a> is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa. The account (which was pointed out to me by Finn Brunton) talks of an inventive use of encrypted text transmitted via analog modem tones recorded to cassette tape and then played back via untraceable pay phones. It's a remarkable tale of late 80s underground crypto, leading up to the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>

<p>From the text, to give you a flavor of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To test this hypothesis I wrote a little program to send some computer output to the modem. Sure enough the sounds came out of the modem`s speaker. These I recorded and played back into the microphone end of the modem while running a communications program on the computer. Eureka! The characters appeared on the screen. I had done with a modem what we were attempting to do with our tone machine.</p>
  
  <p>This seemed to be the real breakthrough. I adapted our encryption program to work with the acoustic modem and recorded the output on a tape recorder. This I took to a public telephone booth and played back to my answering machine. Then I played the answering machine <code>message</code> back into the modem and the computer deciphered it successfully. As the plaintext message appeared on the screen I realised that we had finally discovered an absolutely safe method of communicating with the underground using computers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work originally appeared in a series of six articles in the ANC`s monthly journal Mayibuye from May 1995 to October 1995. </p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/">Mack Collier</a> has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (<a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/how-to-write-awesome-blog-posts/">Here, go read it.</a>) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does.</p>

<p>Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!"  These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. They are not, however, how I write my weblog - and not a style for you, unless you are in a weird job where counting pageviews drives your wages.</p>

<p>The net has enough of the hyperkinetic blog fodder to go around. What it doesn't have, and needs, is bloggers who take an old-school approach to blog writing and who are careful and respectful of their audiences.</p>

<p>Blogging is about writing to pick up an audience, one that would read everything you had to say and comment on it. That means not only writing about what people might click on because their eye got caught by a headline, but also writing the day-in, day-out thematic and topical materials that someone who cares more than a little bit will follow along for detail.</p>

<p>Blogging is figuring out what sorts of regular obscure parts of the world that you cover and being a go-to resource for that issue when it comes up in the world. To illustrate, I bring you Dave Petley's <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/">Landslide Blog</a>. You won't find awesome stock photography, but you will find a whole series of carefully selected photos that illustrate the stories he writes about landslides and their origin and effect. Or see the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/">Backyard Arthropod Project</a>, which is a lovingly illustrated guide to the bugs of Atlantic Mine, MI with great macrophotography of bugs, beetles, insects, spiders, slugs, and more. There are dozens more like this, people who toil away in relative obscurity writing carefully about their craft, and I love them. It's a style that lends itself to slowly but surely being a recognized expert in your field. </p>

<p>I love weblogs that take a narrow view on some interesting part of the world and are thorough in how they document it. They don't need weird tricks or compelling lists or catchy copy to make their mark on the world. Rather, they illustrate and tell a whole series of stories that might never have been told before, told by someone who is expert in their corner of the world. Even though they might only get a few followers compared to Buzzfeed, they add a lot more to our understanding of the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. Each of the pieces that you are writing will need to contemplate a part of the net that might lead to its own distractions.</p>

<p>I am always impressed by people who have the ability to sit down and crank out clean copy that is ready for publication. It's not by any means easy to do this, and certainly every written work can be improved by judicious editing. I'm thinking more of the remarkable skill where you can type as fast as you can for a short burst and have the resulting words make sense, flow nicely, and be worth posting to the world.</p>

<p>The practice I get doing this has a lot to do with blogging, where I want to capture the moment and some momentarily interesting topic and put my mark on it. This is not writing a novel, and not writing a little piece of a 20-page or 400-page non-fiction work; rather, it's somewhere between journalism and blogging. The work you are composing is temporarily interesting to a number of people in part because it has a good headline for Twitter and a body full of words that search engines like. You've written news, but it's within the context of a blog, and because of that it's perfectly acceptable to leave questions unanswered and stories unresolved. It's what musician Michelle Shocked called the "incomplete image", and perhaps you are waiting for someone with a longer deadline to write up the full story.</p>

<p>I know from experience that I can put together 500 words in a sitting on one topic without taking a break and without needing to consult an outline. The much more challenging part is making a long, coherent single narrative out of these intermediate pieces parts. The skill of impromptu essay writing is by no means the same as the skill of book writing, and the task of challenging yourself to come up with a story that moves the current understanding a bit forward is a challenge. </p>

<p>To some degree, I'm willing to pad out those words with ample quotations from other sources, a sort of journalistic cut-and-paste that sifts through less well known sources to string together a story. (Of course the excerpts are carefully hyperlinked to avoid any suggestion of use without attribution.) Careful reuse of existing copy is one of the qualities that blogging can take advantage of that isn't generally OK in journalism circles. </p>

<p>If all you wrote were impromptu essays for the net, you'd quickly find out what was a keeper by the traffic you were able to draw in. On a good day, I'm happy to write three or four blog posts that either satisfy my own interest in preserving a bit of news or that advance some larger story or that answer a question that's on more than one person's mind right now. That would translate into 2000 words on a good day, and that doesn't sound like a lot. I think you'd have to work hard to keep the hopper full of article ideas and to keep up the research that fed a constant stream of ideas to work from, and to work doubly hard to collect the sort of essay-sized chunks that would eventually tell a story that's longer and more carefully planned.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">small wins and writing productivity</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small win is a concrete, complete outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of small wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals. A series of small wins is also more structurally sound than a large win because small wins are stable building blocks. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. When a solution is put into place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible. Additional resources flow toward winners, which means that slightly larger wins can be attempted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, rather than think about how hard it would be to produce a book of 80,000 words all in one sitting, it gets a lot easier to think how easy it would be to produce 400 words per day (on a topic of your choice naturally) for 200 days over the course of a year. I can bat out 100 words without thinking about it to answer an email message a dozen times a day. So capturing 80,000 words is simply a matter of doing that in some sensible order and not getting sidetracked by the need for everything to make 100% sense at the very beginning.</p>

<p>In addition, on 8 December 2013 there were several aftershocks, including a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/us/b000ldn6/us/index.html">magnitude 3.1 quake</a> just after midnight local time.</p>

<p>Reuters has a good overview of the Oklahoma earthquake situation in a November 11, 2013 article by Carey Gillam. Quakes are up sharply in recent years, and the ongoing concern is that they are related to the fracking (hydraulic fracturing) techniques used in the oil and gas industry. From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/19/us-usa-earthquakes-fracking-oklahoma-idUSBRE9AI12W20131119">Reuters</a>: "In Oklahoma, water, fracking - and a swarm of quakes"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seismologist Austin Holland wants to start an earthquake.</p>
  
  <p>From his office a few feet below the earth's surface - a basement at the University of Oklahoma in Norman - Holland, who tracks quakes for the Oklahoma Geological Survey, is digging into a complex riddle: Is a dramatic rise in the size and number of quakes in his state related to oil and gas production activity? And, if so, what can be done to stop it?</p>
  
  <p>As part of his wide-ranging research, Holland is proposing to inject pressurized water into porous rock in an area already known to be earthquake-prone, to see whether injections of oil industry wastewater are contributing to a "swarm" of earthquakes rocking the state.</p>

      <p>This is a quote from (of all places) the National Plant Diagnostic Network's <a href="http://www.npdn.org/infosec_confidentiality_privacy">handbook on email security</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Information leaks are also a problem with email. Emails are often forwarded beyond the original list of recipients — have you ever received an email from a friend with a confidentiality or copyright notice at the bottom? This is an attempt by your friend’s employer to make sure that confidential information does not get forwarded on to someone who is not supposed to see it. Unfortunately, it is so easy to send email that information spreads beyond what you intend, especially if the information is confidential, classified or newsworthy. Sending out confidential information of any kind in an email can be especially dangerous and costly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a rule, people do send out private and confidential information via email all the time. It's one of the risks we take when engaging in public discourse on a not-too-public mailing list, and it's one of the challenges of balancing convenience with safety. If you had to arrange a dead drop in person to convey information to everyone in your extended circle of friends it would get very tedious very fast.</p>

<p>The problem is particularly challenging when the information is not just confidential but also newsworthy. News tends to leak out (cf. Snowden) in ways that aren't always comfortable to those who have had their confidences betrayed. Even people who should know better - those public officials whose correspondence on official matters is subject to FOIA - protest vigorously when their email is made a matter of public record. Yet we continue on, using open wires and easy-to-forward messages to do our daily business.</p>

      <p>Saturday, 7 December 2013 - ANN ARBOR - It looks like the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">a2gov.org</a> web site is not functioning correctly.</p>

<p>The error behavior is strange, in that every valid page fetched yields a blank page, but if you go to a page that's not valid on the site you get a 404 error (and another blank page).</p>

<p>I don't know if a2gov.org email is also affected. </p>

<p>UPDATE: All systems appear to be functioning correctly again at 3:10p Saturday.</p>

<p>New on the board: Steve Powers</p>

<p>Media in the audience: Dave Askins, Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, WEMU; Ryan Stanton, Ann Arbor News.</p>

<p>Audience Participation</p>

<p>Main Street BIZ, Ellie Serras. January 28, coffee and pastries (9am, board meeting at 8am). BIZ not assessing December taxes; considering expanding boundaries of the current BIZ district. (No map provided of new district, and I don't know how quickly this might happen).</p>

<p>624 Church Street, Brad Moore. Asking DDA to modify terms of leasing spaces for payment in lieu of parking. Currently allocated 48 spaces for 15 years. Financing company wants to see 2 10-year extensions added to agreement to make spaces available to let leasing agreement exceed minimum of financing agreement (30 years financing).</p>

<p>Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council, Ray Detter. Holiday party. Commitment to the survival of the State Theater. Short history of theaters in Ann Arbor; refers to State Theater, Michigan Theater area as "Theater District". Owner of building is State Street Theater LLC.</p>

<p>Communications from DDA members.</p>

<p>Sandi Smith: new member introductions. Steve Powers, City Administrator. Cyndi Clark, Lily Grace Cosmetics / Lily Grace Spa.</p>

<p>Russ Collins: Michigan Theater board in communications with owners of State Theater building.</p>

<p>Minutes approved.</p>

<p>Motion to approve annual audit, which is done by Rehmann Robson, the same firm that does the City of Ann Arbor audit. Approved unanimously.</p>

<p>Motion to pay remainder of Main Street Light Pole Replacements, total of $280,000. Of which this is $120,000 from a State Street improvements fund left over from 10 years ago, $160,000 from 2015 TIF budget. Discussion of State Street improvements as well, need expressed by Susan Pollay to revisit light levels in that area. Noted by Russ Collins: Washington Street (south side) lights are off. Approved unanimously.</p>

<p>Old Y Lot: Substitute resolution re "Waive DDA Reimbursement", not included in board packet.  Substance: "The DDA hereby waives its interest in the net proceeds of $1,439,959 from the sale of the 350 S Fifth Avenue property." "The DDA strongly recommends that City Council follow the DDA's example to waive reimbursement to provide the maximum benefit for affordable housing in our community." Noted that the lot just about breaks even on parking revenues vs. interest payments; $1.4 million figure mostly reflects demolition costs of Old Y as well as the costs of creating the parking lot. Goal of DDA to put maximum set aside for affordable housing in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Goal/promise to rebuild 100 beds in downtown area has not happened. Russ Collins asks about strategic planning for use of these funds. Sandi Smith: current fund is nearly depleted.  Passes unanimously.</p>

<p>Interesting quote from previous discussion, here slightly but not much out of context: "We are told we are a shadow government" - Russ Collins.</p>

<p>New resolution, to address parking agreement brought up for 624 Church Street, not included in board packet. "The DDA recommends that the City extend the length of the parking contract for the 624 Church Street project with a term renewal of <em>_</em> years." Roger Hewitt reluctant to commit to a parking agreement for 30 years, perhaps past the length of the structure. Documents provided indicate that other developments have extended parking agreements, including Ashley Mews (20 yr), McKinley (20 yr), Village Green (20 yr + 4x5 yr extensions), Corner House Lofts (some perpetual, some 20 yr + negotiable renewal). </p>

<p>"Connector - Update". Video presented. 3 alternatives studied: bus rapid transit, streetcars, light rail. "Today buses are overcrowded so we can't just add more." Project 50% increase in auto trips in 20 years. http://aaconnector.com. 3 public meetings held in November, input on route options. Study needs to be completed in Q1 2014, "preferred local option" alternative provided in next few months. Two locations considered, one for central campus, one near Blake Transit Center. Federal funding depends on "savings in travel time". Cost as little as $100m, as much as $500m, about 1/2 from Federal funding (stand in line). Local match (50%) to include U of Michigan dollars. Don't expect anything rolling in less than 10 years. "Very long process."</p>

<p>"Bicycle Projects - Update". Keith Orr. Bike Share (B-Cycle). No specific requests to DDA, still looking at sites for 14 locations, goal to launch on Earth Day. Maynard Bike House largely a commuting option, not always the same people. So successful that already looking at other locations for bike houses. </p>

<p>GetDowntown - More rides, more participating organizations, more cards sold and used, continuing to be more popular. Nancy Shore point of contact.</p>

<p>NHL Winter Classic - parking. Planning. The Puck Drops Here for New Year's Eve. Parking strategy: NYE expecting everyone going home at the same time. Flat rate fee where there is congestion, 4/william and forest flat rate, don't have to stop at cashier booth. Consider for other facilities. New Year's Day: lot of reliance on buses. NHL asked to staff public garages to reserve parking space in advance, flagged in like Art Fair. "Ambassadors" to give you directions back to the garage. Specific map produced for the event. Republic Parking to provide labor. Charge for parking in structures and lots, $5 flat fee. Not meant to be an excessive amount. No projected numbers for parking demand is available. Urging mass transit as a way to get to and from the venue. Lawn parking will be allowed in the neighborhoods. Not likely to have as many locals as out of towners.</p>

<p>Downtown ambassador program. Roger Hewitt. "A number of views expressed." Most people thought it was a good idea, should "aggressively pursue it". Would like to see something in place for the summer. Learn from Grand Rapids experience. Not sure how much it's going to cost. </p>

<p>Chamber Impact conference report, report from Joan Lowenstein. Refer to prosperity, not unemployment. Michigan and Ann Arbor "lagging behind" Madison e.g. in attracting young professionals. Suggestions: transit, private sector growth, density. Attracting young professionals leads to attracting families (people settle down where they get their 1st job). "The nature of the media and social media you can get trashed just by putting yourself out in public."</p>

<p>Communication: Al McWilliams, Rishi Narayan. </p>

<p>2014 Calendar: propose to move 1/1 DDA meeting to 1/8, Partnerships move from 1/8 to 1/15. Otherwise calendar is the same. </p>

<p>Public comment: I talked about the need for pedestrian safety in the downtown area, based on observation that there's a density of car-pedestrian crashes downtown and on campus.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council's amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.</p>

      <p>Not just because we lost (though you can't fault the coach for trying to win rather than going for the tie). Nope, it was a big disappointment because the kids couldn't park any cars on the lawn. A good day would have meant $20 or $25 a car, but even for the Big Game there were still free spaces on the street.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Inbox zero just means that I have filled up the todo list. In this particular instance, my Gmail inbox is completely empty, and my todo list (kept in Github) has about 60 items on it, some of which have been on there for a year.</p>

<p>At some point you get to the state where there's one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things.</p>

<p>I find that my electronic record-keeping of things to do only goes so far, and from time to time I have to get away completely from electronica and sit down with pen and paper and write up the things that appear only on paper. It's like there's a separate queue for that stuff and the way to empty it out of my brain into a computer is via a paper intermediary. I wonder how many other environments that I could be in that would unearth new tasks.</p>

<p>I don't know yet what the correct high water and low water marks are on my issue list. Having 60 things to do seems like too few, and when I hit 100 a few months ago it seemed overwhelming. At 60 I figure I should be able to sit somewhere and brainstorm some goals that will take a while to accomplish (e.g. more durable than "do laundry") and stretch to reach something. </p>

<p>List-keeping is one of those dreadful refinements of modern life, where you have an extended amount of effort spent tracking what you're doing vs. actually doing it. Yet without somewhere to dump the list I would have no idea what I'm not doing right now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://a2docs.org/doc/326/">These documents (in CSV and Excel format) provide a list of restaurants in Washtenaw County that were inspected in October 2013, as well as a count of violations</a>. Also accompanying this data is a press release from the county describing how to interpret the data. I've put copies on a2docs.</p>

<p>This was prompted in part by the latest <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/restaurant_inspections_for_was_1.html">Ann Arbor News</a> publication of this data, which did not have the whole list visible or sortable in any useful way.</p>

<p>A version of the list is embedded here in a Google Spreadsheet. I've sorted it by the count of "priority" violations, which is definitely not the only way to sort it. If you're looking for raw data, the a2docs files are sufficiently detailed that you can draw your own conclusions, make your own maps, etc.</p>

<p>These are only raw counts, and it's worth noting this sentence from the press release: "Priority and Priority Foundation Violations must be corrected immediately at the time of inspection or within 10 days."</p>

<p>You can see detailed reports on the <a href="http://www.swordsolutions.com/inspections/pgesearchresults.asp?County=28">Sword Systems website</a> which hosts county inspection data for a number of counties throughout the state. Alas, there's no way to link deep into this database to connect a given restaurant to its inspection, and no way to run a query like "who has mice in their kitchen". </p>

      </h3>
      <p>We had a good time and a lively discussion at the 3d Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup. There were about 18 people in attendance, including the City of Ann Arbor CFO/CIO, the webmaster from Washtenaw County, several U of Michigan SI students, some townies, a fellow who drove down from Lansing who had organized Code Michigan hackathon, and a number of folks who were drawn in from Meetup. (who did I miss)</p>

<p>After everyone introduced themselves we did a few rounds of discussion of the projects that people were working on with public data as well as some talk about data that wasn't available in easy formats. Projects included</p>

<ul>
<li>the detailed data from the 1,4 Dioxane plume that is spreading under Ann Arbor</li>
<li>traffic crash facts and accident reports to inform pedestrian safety discussions</li>
<li>estimating rental property utility costs from crowdsourced data</li>
<li>liberating restaurant inspections from proprietary databases</li>
<li>data about dangerous buildings and nuisance properties</li>
<li>adopt-a-storm-drain</li>
<li>report from a "data dive" that looked at non-profit data in a hackathon</li>
<li>(what did I miss)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these projects were actively in development (several were "gee wouldn't be nice if") and there was not one single effort that everyone focused on. Instead it was a healthy back and forth about a lot of possible directions.</p>

<p>We started at 7p and ended at 830p, and people stayed around talking until 9p. I'm happy with the turnout and with the people who showed up, and am hopeful that the next meeting (in January) will be as well received. We had an offer to host it in a Washtenaw County facility for the next event.</p>

Dear Pioneer Families,

I have notified the Pioneer community today that Ms. Cindy Leaman has agreed
to serve as Principal of Ann Arbor's A2 Virtual+ Academy beginning 
January 6, 2014.

Ms. Tamber Woodworth will serve as Principal for the remainder of the 
school year. Ms. Woodworth has agreed to return to Pioneer where 
she served previously as both a class principal and principal prior 
to her retirement.

I know we will all work together to support our students at Pioneer.

Thank you,

Jeanice Swift

Superintendent.

      </h3>
      <p>From the <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home">CHIRP web site</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio's programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com">Radio Reference</a> and <a href="http://www.repeaterbook.com/">RepeaterBook</a> to find the channels you want to have easy access to. Programming the device should just be a matter of loading in the set you want, attaching your radio to your computer via a programming cable, and selecting "Upload to Radio".</p>

<p>My new radio is on its way, so I'll update this when I get it to work! So far the application was easy to install (you have to install a Python runtime on OS X before it works) and it was easy to get the Washtenaw county repeater list from <a href="http://www.repeaterbook.com/">RepeaterBook</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATED: It worked the first time! Here's what I had to do to make it go smoothly.</p>

<p>First, before you upload channels to your radio, you have to download its current configuration. This gets all of the settings out of the system.</p>

<p>Second, after you are done uploading the channels, unplug the programming cable from the radio. This should be obvious? but somehow it wasn't. Once I unplugged things everything worked just fine.</p>

<p>Third, make sure that you pick the right radio that you are connecting to or else unpredictable things can happen.</p>

<p>I found the walk-through at <a href="http://www.miklor.com/COM/UV_CHIRP.php">Miklor's CHIRP Software Guide</a> to be useful and helpful, and it suggested some additional features (like setting channels to be receive-only) that will probably get me to re-program the radio a few times before I'm done.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months, even though the Dread Pirate Roberts was taken offline. A recent graph shows the currency trading above $800.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-11-24 at 3.19.37 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-11-24 at 3.19.37 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b01998a7b970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>What has changed that would drive the price from $140 to $800? The only simple answer (right or wrong) is China. The <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1364040/value-virtual-currency-bitcoin-skyrockets">South China Morning Post</a> reports -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A US Senate hearing put bitcoin firmly in the mainstream and triggered fresh support from countries that tend to fall in line with America's financial regulatory regime.</p>
  
  <p>In the past 30 days, the price of a single bitcoin has quadrupled, with Chinese speculators among the most enthusiastic buyers.</p>
  
  <p>The question now is whether bitcoin can fulfill the goal it was conceived for: a fast, cheap online payment method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20131122000032&amp;cid=1202">Want China Times</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bitcoin has become the world's most heated investment target over the past week, appreciating by US$100 daily on average due to widespread speculation, the Shanghai-based China Business News reports.</p>
  
  <p>On Tuesday, on China's biggest bitcoin platform, <a href="https://vip.btcchina.com/">BTC China</a>, one bitcoin could be exchanged for more than 6,000 yuan (US$984.57), an intraday high, with the day's average at 5,888 yuan (US$966.04), up sharply from 3,226 yuan (US$529.29) a day earlier. BTC China just recently surpassed Tokyo-based Mt.Gox to become the world's largest bitcoin trading platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BTC China wisely warns</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important Bitcoin trading can be considered a high-risk activity, where Bitcoin prices are volatile, and can swing wildly, from day to day. Please use your extreme judgement when making the decision to invest in, or to sell, Bitcoins. BTC China is not soliciting for users to buy or sell Bitcoins, as an investment, or for profit. All Bitcoin trading decisions should be made independently by the user.</p>

It says that I've crossed 1200+ things off my todo lists and still have 70+ left to go. Unlike "inbox zero", I'm resigned to the notion that my todo list will hover somewhere between 60 and 90 things to do at any time.</p>

<p><a href="http://octodroid.com/">Octodroid</a> is a Github client for Android. It provides access to a bunch of Github features, most notably the issues feature. I can sort through issues, scroll through them, add comments and mark them as closed. It's free (free is good) though there hasn't been an update to the software in the better part of a year.</p>

<p>There are other fancier todo lists in the world, but very few of them come with a complete source code control system and a serviceable wiki. My only complaint with any of the Android tools for Github that I've found so far is that none of them are really good wiki editors. I sometimes miss how good Evernote is at providing a simple synchronized text editor, and wish that it had more wiki-nature. Octodroid is just good enough at tracking what I'm doing and not doing to satisfy the need to have a todo list that goes with me everywhere that doesn't live in my inbox.</p>

      <p>"An Open Letter to President Coleman and Provost Pollack", published on <a href="http://um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/">um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/</a> - from the lead paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, the undersigned faculty of the University of Michigan, support your intent to realign administrative expenses relative to revenues. However we collectively reject the proposed Administrative Services Transformation (AST) project. We respectfully offer an alternative approach to AST, which we call Unit- Centric Services (UCS). We believe that the AST approach is inherently flawed because its focus is on reducing administrative costs without taking into account the concurrent reduction in faculty and staff productivity, collaborative academic culture, and the unique needs of heterogeneous academic units. In contrast, UCS's focus is on productivity and intra-unit efficiencies. Higher productivity translates into higher revenues relative to expenses, even though expenses may, but do not need to, be higher. The unique cultures and modes of operation of different units are facilitated by staff that retain corporate knowledge of local processes. Conversely, AST is a top-down program that eliminates the ability to retain corporate knowledge and leverage the unit-culture experiences of some 300 support staff while limiting their contributions to a series of transactional tasks in a call center. The inevitable result is to tax the faculty with numerous clerical tasks, thereby reducing their accessibility to students and their productivity as scholars and researchers. In contrast, the premise of UCS is to develop a strategic plan aimed at improving productivity at the unit level (school/college and/or department), with plans developed with full participation by the faculty, staff and administrators in that unit, and in tune with the particular academic culture and practices of that unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of this writing, the document is signed by 594 faculty members.</p>

<p>Clearly, one of the things that the University would need to centralize to avoid public displays of dissent is the control of web sites and the domain name system.</p>

  <p>Nineteen department chairs in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts -- the largest college on campus -- wrote a Nov. 1 letter to senior administrators protesting an “air of secrecy” around the effort and raising concerns that longtime staffers, particularly lower-income women, would be hurt by the changes, either because of layoffs or pay cuts.
  In response, senior Michigan officials wrote a Nov. 14 letter acknowledging they were “not sensitive or consultative enough in the planning and communication of this initiative.”</p>

<p>I used to organize lunch every Thursday at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. Then the restaurant closed, and my A2B3 lunch group was set adrift. Here's what we've been up to.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">email list</a> that goes with the group has been steady even with the disruption in the lunch routine. There's a steady stream of questions with answers, job postings, news about events and the like. List membership is in the 450 range, and a relatively typical month has about 90 messages. The list has been going since August 2005 and occasionally gets written up in print (an Ann Arbor Observer mention was most recent).</p>

<p>I've added a <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">meetup group</a> to help actually plan actual events, since it's pretty good about nagging people without me having to nag people, and it's handy to have RSVPs.</p>

<p>Since there is an effective way to switch locations, we've started to rotate events more. In recent week's we've visited Bell's Diner on W Stadium and Be Won on Green Road for lunch, and in both cases had 10 or more people out for lunch. This actually poses a problem at most restaurants - Bell's seats 8 comfortably with a little planning but 13 was a stretch. At Be Won we seated 6 and then sent 4 next door to Zamaan Cafe for what was apparently delicious middle eastern food (I mean to try it next time I'm up there).</p>

<p>The staple routine, which seems to be about every other week, is to go to Madras Masala on Maynard Street for a lunch buffet ($11 includes tip). We can always handle 8 there without any planning, and if ever we got so many RSVPs that we needed to plan for more they've been very accomodating. The food is good though some people don't like how spicy it is, and parking at the neighboring Maynard St structure is close unless of course you have a truck in which case it's kind of dicey.</p>

<p>What I love about organizing lunch for 450 (of whom 8 show up on a typical week) is just how much of the Ann Arbor community I've had lunch with. Since 2005, I'll estimate conservatively that I've had lunch with 4500 people (9 years * 50 weeks * 10 people average). That number is probably low because at the depths of the recession we were seeing 25 or 30 people at a time who had a lunch hour free. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">Former Ann Arbor Public Schools principal accused of plagiarism</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. How many different very short birthday greetings can you send?</p>

<p>That said, educators are usually held to higher standards of writing than their students, and writing is expected to be something that they are good enough at that they don't need to crib from someone else's words.</p>

<p>With that as a preface, here's someone else's words about someone else using someone else's words, in this case a former AAPS principal (Sulura Jackson) who is now in Chapel Hill, NC. The reporting is from <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/chapel-hill-high-school-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/Content?oid=3770001">Indy Week</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What they found is startling: Multiple documents obtained by the INDY that show Jackson—before and after her arrival at Chapel Hill High—lifted entire passages and letters from books, online articles and teaching resource guides. She used those passages without citation in staff memos, letters to students and even recommendation letters for colleagues, frequently passing them off as her words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the world of education is full of web sites that are full of reusable forms and letters for communicating with students and teachers, like this <a href="http://www.educationworld.com/tools_templates/index.shtml">Education World</a> page</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Communicate with parents by snail mail or e-mail with these editable and/or printable forms and letters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the business world in general, with this set of <a href="http://www.4hb.com/letters/index.html">662 business letters</a> - catchy titles like "Apology to receiver of NSF check" -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I received your letter of (date) with my check
  attached marked "insufficient funds", I called my bank
  immediately.</p>
  
  <p>The gentleman I spoke with, (name) , discovered
  that the bank had failed to credit my account with a
  substantial deposit I had made several days prior.</p>
  
  <p>The bank has assured me that they will be sending you a
  formal letter of apology for their error. Attached is my
  check in the amount of $ to replace the dishonored
  one you have returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communications from authorities are often ritualistic, formulaic, and repetitious. Hopefully, though, they are not careless. Jackson was tripped up by this mistake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking back, the alleged plagiarism might have gone unnoticed were it not for one careless sentence the Chapel Hill High School principal wrote in an October condolence letter to a teacher.</p>
  
  <p>"Everyone at Skyline is saddened to learn of the death of your mother," the letter said.</p>
  
  <p>It seemed Sulura Jackson, who arrived in Chapel Hill this summer with a sparkling, lengthy résumé, had failed to remove the name of her former school, Skyline High, in Ann Arbor, Mich., from the text.</p>
  
  <p>Teachers who spoke to the INDY on the condition that their names not be used for fear of retribution say the incident prompted them to dig deeper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're going to use a form letter, for goodness sake read the whole form and fill in all the blanks before sending it !</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/triangulator/archives/2013/11/21/whats-next-for-chhs-principal-accused-of-plagiarism">Again from Indy Week</a>: "More evidence of Chapel Hill High plagiarism?"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Members of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools Board of Education were already scheduled to meet tonight at the Lincoln Center in Chapel Hill. The board's agenda says members will discuss a personnel matter in closed session starting at 6 p.m. The public portion of the meeting begins at 7 p.m.</p>

      <p>I saw this today at the poster wall near the Fishbowl on the University of Michigan central campus. The <a href="http://tchat.io/rooms/bbum">#BBUM</a> hashtag has been trending for a couple of days now. It stands for "Being Black at the University of Michigan", and it's part of a brilliant campaign organized by the <a href="http://www.theblackstudentunion.com/">Black Student Union</a> that shows no signs of stopping.</p>

      <p>I've temporarily restyled this weblog with colorful link text, as many people don't realize that I'm linking to things.</p>

<p>The CSS is</p>

<pre>
 a:link    { color: #c00 }  /* unvisited links */
 a:visited { color: #0c0 }  /* visited links   */
 a:hover   { color: #00c }  /* user hovers     */
 a:active  { color: #ccc }  /* active links    */
</pre>

<p>I'm sure it could be better or different; indeed, that style didn't last long before I went to more typical blue for link text and purple for visited links.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c img-responsive" alt="Aael-cvga-300x225" title="Aael-cvga-300x225" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I went with S and J to the <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive</a> (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman">David S. Carter</a> (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. An annual collection budget of about $13,000 buys new games and the occasional old console from eBay. The archive has a near complete collection of US consoles, and Dave said they are looking to expand their international coverage. One of their latest acquisitions was a DVD system that plays only one title. The archive would like to improve its collection of handheld games.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of the next five years is with digital rights management (DRM). The DRM systems envisioned would lock a game to a particular piece of console hardware, making it impossible to have used games and very hard for a library to add a title to a collection. For network-delivered games like Steam it's equally hard for the library to spend $10 on a license, when licenses negotiated by libraries for things like electronic versions of journals are usually for much more.</p>

<p>Dave said the archive was pretty much where they want to be after 5 years. He knew they were on the right track when they got space in the library even before they had a budget. The challenge of next five years is less collection building and more about building connections across campus and around the world to other research collections. He compared the collection to early film and video collections, now standard at all research libraries, but once considered a novelty.</p>

<p>Other comparable collections are at the <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/videogamearchive/index.php">University of Texas at Austin</a> and at <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/03/stanford-libraries-preserves-historical-software-collection-federal-agency">Stanford</a>. Public libraries so not tend to have research collections, preferring to  either use video games strictly for events or to have a circulating collection where you check out current games like any other video or music media.</p>

<p>I asked Dave about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware">Internet Archive's online gaming collection</a>, and especially about the role of emulation in preserving games. He told me that emulation does not preserve original game play, especially the ergonomics of controllers. Playing on original game hardware with original video hardware gives you an accurate rendition of original game play experience. (Besides, you can't play <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005840579">Duck Hunt</a> without an old fashioned TV because the game depends on sensing the scan lines on the TV.) Some old games are very hard to enjoy on original hardware and the limitations of the controls, not the game itself, are what trips up your enjoyment.</p>
