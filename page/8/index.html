        <p>@tallervielmetti is using my old black Macbook. It's never been an exceptionally fast machine, but it's been super laggy of late, hence the name Lag Monster. I installed all kinds of crap on that machine to test it out, and never uninstalled a lot of it. It turns out that some judicious uninstalls seemed to help a lot to keep the load average down. Some hints to my future self if these ever re-emerge: BBLaunchAgent. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-making-lag-monster-a-bit-less-laggy/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some notes before I try to do the build. The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick. Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket. The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-building-a-dipole-antenna-for-your-sdr-tuner-stick-from-an-old-set-of-headphones/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day. For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-17-two-repaired-shortwave-receivers-in-one-day-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result. I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city's employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-14-when-is-ann-arbor-going-to-have-a-full-time-building-official/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is the AAATA Route 5 summer 2015 inbound to Ann Arbor schedule, as it looks as embedded with ViewerJS. I note on Chrome on Mac OS X that the map is white on black instead of the black on white that I see in Preview. Report is that this looks like a grey box on an iPhone. I note that on Windows Phone 8.1 it loads slowly and the fonts are very blocky, and the map is a somewhat legible black on white. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-13-summer-2015-route-5-to-ann-arbor-schedule-as-embedded-with-viewerjs/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it's running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it's also quite economical. That said, there's one feature on the phone that wasn't a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-10-disable-quiet-hours-on-your-windows-phone-81-so-you-always-take-that-late-night-call/">&raquo;</a></p>
