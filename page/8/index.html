<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Symptoms include no audio inputs when a headset is plugged in, but the built-in mic works fine when the headset is not plugged in.</p>

<p><code>sudo killall coreaudiod</code> is one suggested fix.</p>

<p>This superuser.com article tells you how to <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/647396/reload-mac-audio-drivers-without-rebooting">reload Mac audio drivers without rebooting</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mohan Kartha for helping sort this out; still not convinced I can adequately fix it with these tools, or even that I have diagnosed the issue. Some of the discussion is about a "stuck optical switch".</p>

<p>Genius bar next.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Genius bar helpfully scheduled an appointment. The folks at the Apple store helpfully let me try other headsets and other mics and other computers, and the problem seemed to be isolated to my computer.</p>

<p>In the meantime I poked and poked and eventually landed on a description of the "Audio MIDI Setup" utility. I dutifully clicked through to it to see what was up, adjusted a few things, and then found this:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-29 at 11.13.41 AM" title="Screen Shot 2014-10-29 at 11.13.41 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07a1c626970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Note that audio input is unhelpfully marked "mute". When I unmute, everything works fine. Why on earth this only shows up deep in the MIDI setup of all places I'm not sure; I know that I had fiddled around there before.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a> now has Usenet news, of the very old fashioned sort where there is only a small handful of newsgroups and where people are still figuring out their newsreaders and news hosting systems and where there's no spam.</p>

<p>Instructions are at <a href="http://tilde.club/~emv/usenet">~emv/usenet</a>, such as they are; looking to get enough people on board so that there's a reasonable next step of setting up a feed infrastructure of some kind eventually. The current set of directions are rather plain, but it will get more fancy, just fancy enough to bootstrap but not much more.</p>

<p>I miss Usenet terribly much, since it's a place where I spent a lot of time and made a lot of friends. It was horrible when it was deluged in the Eternal September, and it never really recovered. It's entirely possible that the network can be reconstructed in bits, one little system at a time very selectively feeding groups to other little systems, but it's going to take some work.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I checked out a <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1459952">27 watt solar panel</a> with a very beefy battery from the Ann Arbor District Library. The battery also charges via a wall wart, and provides either 5V USB power or switchable 10V-19V DC. </p>

<p>I've been thinking about getting a solar panel, and my conclusion is that 27 watts is overkill for my normal use case which is powering my phone. The battery was awesome, but again overkill - too heavy to be an everyday carry.</p>

<p>My next checkout will be <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/14581720">this kit with a 7 watt panel</a> that looks more portable.</p>

<p>Power to the people!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The next major ancient Internet subsystem I'd like to get back is Usenet News. tin, trn, rn etc I all have a lot of muscle memory for, and by running netnews inside a closed network of other relatively trusted sites you have some hope of scaling the whole thing without needing to bust out into the swamp of the wild, wild Internet of netnews.</p>

<p>There's <a href="http://www.tin.org">tin</a>, ready to be compiled when you are. And it does compile on my MacBook, just with "brew install tin", so that's good. I signed up for <a href="http://www.eternal-september.org">eternal-september</a> to get an account that I can read netnews with. The eventual command line ends up being</p>

<pre>
tin -q -A -g news.eternal-september.org
</pre>

<p>Usenet appears to be a vast cesspool, but I think that's just a matter of not taking feeds from a lot of places and being ready to start new newsgroups that have limited distribution. I want to pick up on some of the de.* groups so I can brush up on my German again. Once upon I time I had an NNTP feed to fu-berlin.</p>

      <p>Fun with source code control, so you don't lose any text. 
git and especially <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti">github</a> is
your friend.</p>

<p>Fun with server-side includes, learning about the Meta refresh hack,
and the XBitHack.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
to manage multiple shells on the same terminal. it
seems to work nicely under mosh. In the process of doing so I managed
to strand a bunch of mosh shells, which I'm going to clean up.</p>

<p><a href="http://tilde.club/~sippey">~sippey</a> is writing about 
time travel. We're at the permalinks stage
of weblog development, but I haven't sorted out just quite yet how to
make that work perfectly if/when I end up moving this date's post off
the front page. Or maybe I just type here indefinitely; or maybe I post
this also somewhere else, just to have a backup.</p>

<p>I'm logged in to tilde.club on my Android device using <a href="http://juicessh.com">JuiceSSH</a>. 
JuiceSSH has a nice keyboard for doing special characters, and it supports both
mosh and ssh for access.</p>

<p>I'm logged in to tilde.club using the <a href="http://mosh.mit.edu">mosh</a> shell, which
is said to be better as a laptop-to-the-cloud shell because it doesn't lose state
when you lose a network connection and re-establish elsewhere.</p>

<p>This design is based on my <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html">first weblog</a>, so it's kind of rough, and it
uses tables, and it's very, very plain. But I miss the weblogs of 1999
and am happy to be back at it. It's very nice to share a shell prompt

      <p>I'm playing on <a href="http://tilde.club/~emv">tilde.club/~emv</a>.</p>

<p>It's interesting and fun to try to write a weblog when you don't have any content management system other than the Unix shell, but at some point quickly you end up moving a file on top of another file and wiping out a bunch of work, and then it gets less fun.</p>

<p>What I think I want to do there is write in Markdown, but somehow assemble bits of Markdown into what ends up looking like an old fashioned blog, with a sidebar that's interesting and ever-changing and a main blog part that's one post per day.</p>

<p>Tooling up to do that is proving interesting. How do you reliably convert markdown to HTML on the command line? It's not part of the standard Linux /usr/bin.</p>

<p>I'm also exercising "git" more these days.</p>

<p>Funtimes. And it's nice to be ~emv again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>RideScout is an app that provides info about a whole range of
transit options, including taxi, car share, bus, parking, and
more. They have support for Ann Arbor as a city, so I tried it
while riding AAATA (The Ride).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ridescoutapp.com/">http://www.ridescoutapp.com/</a></p>

<p>It's the first independent app that I've seen that shows where
every AAATA stop is, in a nice little app that works on your phone
with a zippy little map that scrolls nicely. That's great.</p>

<p>RideScout has bus arrival and departure information for schedules,
but it doesn't have real-time bus location info. So it thought that
I had made it to N Campus when really I was still waiting on the bus at
BTC. It could also have real-time parking info in Ann Arbor from
the Ann Arbor DDA, but it also doesn't. I didn't see the Arborbike
system in there either though that's pretty new.</p>

<p>The company behind RideScout has been bought by Car2Go, a car-sharing
service. <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/texas/2014/09/03/austins-ridescout-bought-by-daimler-car-rental-service-car2go/">Xconomy</a> has the story. Since Car2Go doesn't
have operations in Ann Arbor, I don't know what to expect of their
continued development here, but I like the idea!</p>

      <p>I'm completely happy with my choice of HI-Chicago as a place to stay. It's inexpensive, clean, well run, the staff is friendly, and there's lots of community space in the building to get things done in outside of your room.</p>

<p>I stayed here for the eChicago conference in an 8-person room; this time I upgraded to the 4-person room. Two nights stay is less than $100, which is hard to beat.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One of the tools that I rediscovered and have been really happy for
having done so is &ldquo;jq&rdquo;, a command line tool that bills itself as
&ldquo;awk for json&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing awk code since 1985, and some limited subset
of it is something that I know really, really well. awk, however,
is from the punchcard era, and as such it likes to deal with records
that are all on one line each. Parsing JSON in awk is very clumsy
and ad hoc and really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well. Since most Internet
APIs these days have some kind of JSON encoding, it means that you
can&rsquo;t simply dash off an awk one-liner to consume and transform
Internet input data.</p>

<p>jq fixes that situation. Here for example is a one line renderings of a common task I look to solve with municipal data as a test of any new tool development: analysis of parking data. This code sample prints the total number of open spaces in the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority&rsquo;s garages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>curl -s http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json |
  jq "[.countdata[].spacesavail | tonumber] | add" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to explain how jq works, except to note that
it&rsquo;s constructed in order to be a filter: data comes in one JSON
object at a time, and the script iterates over them, transforming
them in some way and then passing JSON out the other end. This makes
it perfect for ad hoc Unix pipeline efforts where you&rsquo;re chipping
away at a data set trying to make sense of it by successively
refining it as you go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built jq pipelines for this Ann Arbor parking data, for AAATA
bus system data, and for the Marquette Park Cemetery data. The
parking data is straightforward, since it exits the system as JSON.
Bus system data is only incrementally harder; it started either as
HTML or as XML, and for that you want to use &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; and &ldquo;xml2json&rdquo;
in your pipeline. The Park Cemetery data set started as JSON via
the Socrata SODA API, but I needed little bits of &ldquo;sed&rdquo; and &ldquo;perl&rdquo;
to smooth out some rough edges in the source data; it really wants
to end up as GeoJSON when I&rsquo;m done, but it isn&rsquo;t there quite yet.</p>

<p>Shell programming is my favorite programming environment. Any time
I can take a set of well-understood tools and crunch through big
data sets with only a few lines of code, I&rsquo;m happy. The challenge
of shell programming is that it&rsquo;s full of opportunities to get
things just a little bit wrong with parsing; by making JSON the
data format that&rsquo;s shoveled between programs rather than a flat
one-record-per-line text format, you open up the opportunity for
pulling apart rather complex structures and manipulating them with
hardly any work.</p>

<p>For further reading, see Jeroen Janssens new book <a
href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/">Data Science at the
Command Line</a> which works you way through dozens of tools like
this that can help manage big data without big programs.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm working on a tool or a set of tools to assist people in finding grave sites in the Park Cemetery in Marquette, Michigan as a part of a project for Code Michigan. I'm working with a team that's based in the U.P. to do this, and we're collaborating over Google Hangouts. Code Michigan is a hackathon, so this project timeline is compressed to a single weekend. The team is Edward Vielmetti, Jim Argeropoulos, Chris Marr, and Lynn Czarnecki Makela. </p>

<p>My motivation for picking the grave finder app is a personal one. My grandmother, Ada Burt Vielmetti, is buried in Park Cemetery, and I've never visited the grave because I didn't know where it was. The cemetery covers over 100 acres so it's impractical to just wander around until you find what you're looking for, and there wasn't an online finder's aid. When the Code Michigan challenge came about it was an obvious task to tackle.</p>

<p>It turns out that providing detailed location data for individuals seeking to find people inside this cemetery is a common civic task. The role of the sexton, aside from care for the physical properties inside the cemetery, is to guide people to where they are looking for. This could be the grand burial grounds of famous and wealthy people with a beautiful mausoleum, or it could be a simple marker underfoot. In any case the challenge is to provide someone with enough guidance so that they can get close enough to the spot that they can locate exactly the one spot that is of interest.</p>

<p>Some notes on technology:</p>

<p>The maps problem for any geolocation task relies heavily on work that's been done before. Base maps of the city are available from Google, but the Google panopticar has not traversed all of the cemetery lanes and the Google map doesn't show the structure of the roads that you can walk or drive down. Open Street Map is better, in that it does have more detail within the cemetery, but it doesn't go down to the individual grave level.</p>

<p>On top of the base map with roads, there's a plat map showing the sections of the cemetery that's available in PDF format from the city. Our team took this plat map, field checked it, and encoded plat boundaries as GeoJSON files so that we had an accurate representation of the area within the cemetery that an individual could be located. This brings the task down to a range, rather than a specific point, but it's practical enough and a small and precise enough area to be a useful first step.</p>

<p>The data about individual burial locations in Park Cemetery was provided to use using the Socrata SODA API. A challenge here was that the "location" field, a critical one for our use, was encoded in such a way that a simple download of the data would not yield an immediately usable result since the location (in latitude and longitude) of an individual grave is not known. We addressed that issue by using the API's JSON download function to return not only the valid fields in the data but also the ones marked invalid, and a post-processing step cleaned the data to extract a valid "plat" field from the provided data.</p>

<p>JSON is a very easy to manipulate format, and I used two tools that are documented in the new book <a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/">Data Science at the Command Line</a> by Jeroen Jansens. "jq" is like sed for JSON data – you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text. "json" offers powerful and flexible tools for taking JSON data and printing it in flexible formats. Between those two tools and a bit of other Unix command line efforts with "sed" and "perl", it was possible to write a handful of one-line transformations that take the Socrata data and turn it into a more compact JSON and HTML format for use directly inside applications.</p>

<p>By running these transformations on the 12,000 plus record original dataset, I was able to pull out just the location information and basic personal details for everyone - including my Nana. This gets turned into a series of files, one per cemetery section, sorted by lot number so that there's a chance that you could walk a section methodically and have the data be your guide to whether you are close to what you're looking for.</p>

<p>To publish the data in a format that is useful to the world, I turned to an old favorite, Localwiki. This comes with a number of useful tools right off the bat. At one file per cemetery section (e.g. <a href="https://localwiki.org/marquettemi/Marquette_Park_Cemetery_-_Jenney_W">Jenney W</a> the sorted HTML list loads easily into the list. The GeoJSON we created can be imported using the Localwiki API, or cemetery areas or points can be hand-plotted on an OpenStreetMap based map. Names for which Localwiki has more information can be linked. (I resisted the temptation to link every name, though if you had more coverage it would be the obvious next step). </p>

<p>Localwiki is good for this effort for a few reasons. It has a local search tool that lets you type in a name and get something in return. While not as precise as a purpose-built search tool, it's easy to implement, and at 12,000 records spread out into a few dozen sections no individual file is too big to load. We know that Localwiki is good for local search, and eventually when the pages are indexed they will be reachable by Google search as well. </p>

<p>The community aspect of civic data use with Localwiki is an important one. No municipal employee can ever hope to gather biographical data on 12,000 cemetery residents, but we want to support citizens in their interest to collect and refine as much detail as they need to memorialize or to research personal and community history.</p>

<p>In addition to loading Park Cemetery data into Localwiki, we also pursued a prototype of a purpose-built application designed specifically for mobile phone sized screens that would provide a name index and a plat finder for people who are on site. The goal is to reduce the complexity of the problem down to type in a name and get something back on a map that includes a dot saying where you are. This system uses Drupal as a back end, with maps provided through a responsive front end system specially adapted to look good on a mobile phone sized screen. Links are provided to Localwiki for reference data, and the design includes ways for individuals to quickly add to or verify location information so that you can pinpoint a spot.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Some lessons learned from the effort, which isn't done yet but getting close!</p>

<p>It's important to have a variety of skills on your team. We divvied up the problem into parts that were simple enough for each of us to tackle based on our own skills, and sorted through coordination issues via periodic Google Hangout calls. When you're working using tools you are good at and on things you find challenging but not impossible, there's a lot of room for making progress in a short time.</p>

<p>Tools and standards help. We discovered GeoJSON mid-day through day 2, and were able to use it almost immediately to extend our data to be reusable without recoding on multiple platforms. Similarly, the combination of the Socrata SODA API and the powerful "jq" and "json" tools turned a complete data processing problem into a handful of lines of code.</p>

<p>When there's a real problem to be solved, it's easier to see that you are successful. Two members of the team have family members buried in Park Cemetery. With the toolset we developed, we were able to find those graves, photograph the headstones, and decide how to incorporate that data into Localwiki. Knowing now that the problem is solvable with the data provided, it simply follows to extend that solution to a broader set of tasks.</p>

<p>Usable prototypes are more valuable than pixel-perfect finished products. Localwiki let me test ideas almost immediately, without much more than a little bit of coding needed to get to a point where a search engine would return a useful result. The tooling we built for the mobile app got to a usable demo phase promptly. A handful of photographs from the field were enough to not only field-check the data that we had, but also to better understand what we could do when there was more time to do it.</p>

<p>A weekend is not a lot of time to get much beyond the prototype stage.</p>

<hr />

<p>We're not done yet. The contest rules want a video, and we're working on the storyboard. The coding is done, but Localwiki is never really done, and there are some pages to make more spiffy and full of useful content. But in some sense I feel like we've already succeeded, in that a completely hidden system got turned into something that I'm starting to understand.</p>

<p>The proof, perhaps, is that we were able to put together a team that answered the question: where is Nana buried? The proof below.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Throwing out some notes here for a panel I'm on at the #micities conference at the Michigan Union today October 4, 2014.</p>

<p>The questions are around open data, considered as data published by a government agency that has a</p>

<ul>
<li>well defined data format (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML documented API, etc)</li>
<li>well defined access path via Internet (HTTP, FTP, API)</li>
<li>well defined terms of use and reuse</li>
</ul>

<p>Census data is perhaps the most openly open of open data. The worst would be PDFs of spreadsheets only available via FOIA, which fail on data format, access, and copyright.</p>

<p>There are multiple audiences for open data, each with separate goals and plans for their use of the data. A lot has to do with risk taking in the use of the data and in where the benefits to use flow.</p>

<ul>
<li>enterprise: well understood data, no question about long term access</li>
<li>startup: questions about access, format, permissions; risk taking, experimental, commercial</li>
<li>civic: using data to guide policy or management of resources; not overtly commercial</li>
<li>makers: experimental, interest driven, risky but not necessary political or commercial</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see that breaking down use by status (private, public, non-profit) is the right way to slice this. You can have non-profits with enterprise-class IT operations, only willing to try things if they are sure they will work, or non-profits with goals that allow them to experiment. The focus on willingness to cope with uncertainty is the division that seems to be most helpful.</p>

<p>The Value of open data initiatives depends on the audience. Not every data provider recognizes or acknowledges every possible audience. Some data providers and gatekeepers are actively at risk if the data under their stewardship is opened up too much, so there may be a negative value to data access.</p>

<p>Some metrics for usefulness include</p>

<ul>
<li>profit or cost avoidance: simple easy to reckon monetary measures</li>
<li>opportunity seeking, potential value, chance for risky ventures to succeed</li>
<li>good governance, improve (or at least change) civic involvement in decision making</li>
<li>civic engagement, getting people involved with operations as a goal unto itself</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls for civic data are in part administrative and in part political. State and federal laws constrain what kinds of data can and should be released, for privacy, security, and policy reasons. Beyond that, there are costs associated with open publication that have to be weighed against budgets. Sometimes the publication of data imposes costs on an agency that are not recovered, and the profits or gains flow to private groups.</p>
