        <p>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013. From NPR, the FAA is grounding 787s because of battery problems: The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston. What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, according to the Seattle Times: Hot chemicals sprayed out of the battery on the 787 Dreamliner in this week’s emergency landing in Japan, leaving a gooey dark residue and suggesting a different malfunction than last week’s 787 battery fire in Boston, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-17-boeing-787-batteries-ablaze-aloft-lithium-ion-battery-fire-risk-grounds-aircraft/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system. Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &quot;item&quot;) and the subsequent responses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-11-a-modern-version-of-confer-ii-some-thoughts-on-communication-system-structure/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m irritated when so-called newspapers fill their pages by rewriting stories from other newspapers. It&#39;s worst when the rewrite is as long as the original and contains no new reporting, just regurgitage. A typical example: Dexter Patch writes a story about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station. AnnArbor.com follows up with the same story, too lazy even to call any of the officials named in the story to get its own quote. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-05-rewritten-news-blah/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that the Internet is a very large, elaborate, multi-player game. What are its winning conditions? 0. Make money fast. That proves to be difficult, but it&#39;s been pitched so many times that it should go up front first. If you can&#39;t make money quickly, then at least make the promise that you are growing something that will eventually make money even if it&#39;s not making money now. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A France-based school of writing called &quot;Oulipo&quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is an entire novel written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format. A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-01-a-salute-to-oulipo-providing-inspiration-since-my-keyboard-is-missing-a-key-and-i-wonder-if-anyone-w/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details. I&#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&#39;s stumped me before. I&#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked. The key bit which I didn&#39;t use before was a screwdriver. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-31-deciding-which-one-thing-to-do-can-be-harder-than-getting-that-one-thing-done/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Two weeks ago, I started using Github as an issue tracker to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&#39;s some reflection on that use. I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-30-some-reflection-on-use-of-github-as-an-issue-tracker-two-weeks-in/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Technology upgrades are a tedious but necessary task. I&#39;m going through this now, with an upgrade from Mac OS 10.5.8 to Mac OS 10.6.8 on my black MacBook. The world decided in its infinite wisdom that 10.5 was too old to keep supporting, and so quite a bit of software was starting to break.

        <p>750 words has a system of point scoring that lets you keep track of how vigorously you have been pursuing your writing goals. This is very similar to the kinds of other daily projects I have been involved in like various pedometer games with goals of daily walking activity or language learning that prompts you for daily use. Working on something every single day is hard. There are only so many hours in a day, and the commitment to do one thing at the exclusion of something else is a big one. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-28-gaming-and-intermittent-reinforcement-as-ways-of-countering-dropout-in-online-systems/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private Facebook forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &quot;ubiquity&quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &quot;focus&quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-27-ubiquity-focus-and-isolation-as-success-factors-for-internet-socialiability/">&raquo;</a></p>
