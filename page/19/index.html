            <p>A review of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.
Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-09-a-review-of-social-physics-how-good-ideas-spread-the-lessons-from-a-new-science-alex-pentland/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Meetup.com has had a series of bad days. Their site has been under a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for a number of days. To mitigate the problem, they are using the CloudFlare service, but even that has not been working great.
The net effect is that sometimes the Meetup.com site is unavailable, making it hard to sign up or schedule or reschedule events. The Meetup periodic announcements about the problem emphasize how hard they are working to fix it and how user credit cards are not at risk. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-03-meetupcom-ddos-attack-continues-march-3-2014/">&raquo;</a></p>

From Reuters: Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox goes dark in blow to virtual currency
 The website of Mt. Gox suddenly went dark on Tuesday with no explanation, and the company's Tokyo office was empty - the only activity was outside, where a handful of protesters said they had lost money investing in the virtual currency. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-26-mt-gox-is-down-in-bitcoin-heist-transaction-malleability-to-blame/">&raquo;</a></p>

The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks. For the ubergeeks, it also has a very competent IRC client support. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-20-slack-first-impressions/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Depending on the source you get a slightly different story, but the results are the same: there is a lot of volatility in Bitcoin pricing in early February 2014 because of problems at the Mt. Gox exchange. So much for a technologically pristine, mathematically pure, decentralized currency; when your "foreign exchange" depends on a very small number of businesses, it can have systematic vulnerabilities.

The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.

I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-09-decoding-radio-digital-modes-without-a-radio-using-websdr-and-fldigi/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I'd like to do some long form writing, except that I'd publish it on Twitter. I'll write essays as I'd normally write them, making sure that sentences are 140 characters or less. The goal would be to encapsulate an entire argument in pithy sentences and make each one stand on its own. I have no doubt that it would be possible to write quite a few words this way, though you might lose some followers in the bargain. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-06-long-form-writing-as-first-published-to-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>February 5, 2014: More than 623,000 customers were without power in the service area covered by PECO (Philadelphia, PA area) at the peak of an ice storm on Wednesday. This is the second worst storm that the company has reported, right behind Hurricane Sandy.

The PECO power outage map does not go into lots of detail on the map, but it does list individual communities and their outage status in county by county detail pages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-05-february-5-2014-philadelphia-area-power-outages-due-to-ice-storm/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Does email work anymore as a way to connect people who share the same interests, in the old-school Internet sense of the community that forms around a well-managed, well-moderated mailing list? I'm starting to think after having my inbox fill up with well-intentioned communications that the era of the mailing list is over, and with it the era of any other use for email except the purely transactional.
My email messages are relatively long (compared to IMs or tweets), relatively formal, and carefully composed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-30-does-email-even-work-anymore/">&raquo;</a></p>

From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
 It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-29-january-28-2014-atlanta-snowstorm-paralyzes-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8).
