<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Because it's that time of year when sidewalks are full of snow and ice.</p>

<h3>4:60. Snow and ice.</h3>

<p>All snow and ice which has accumulated prior to 6:00 a.m. on a public sidewalk adjacent to property not zoned residentially shall be removed by the owner or occupant by noon. Immediately after the accumulation of ice on such sidewalk it shall be treated with sand, salt or other substance to prevent it from being slippery and the ice shall be removed within the time limits of this paragraph.</p>

<p>Except for sidewalks defined by section 4:51(1)(b) and (c), within 24 hours after the end of each accumulation of snow greater than 1 inch, the owner or occupant of every residentially zoned property shall remove the accumulation from the adjacent public sidewalk and walks and ramps leading to a crosswalk. The accumulation may be from any source including precipitation and drifting. Immediately after the accumulation of ice on such sidewalk, it shall be treated with sand, salt or other substance to prevent it from being slippery and the ice shall be removed within 24 hours after accumulation.</p>

<p>All property zoned PL (public land) shall have snow and ice removed as if it held the same zoning classification as the adjacent property. The removal of snow and ice shall mean free of snow and ice for the entire constructed width and length of the sidewalk, including walks and ramps leading to a crosswalk.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 1, 12-21-92; Ord. No. 49-01, § 3, 10-15-01; Ord. No. 13-15, § 1, 10-21-13)</p>

<h3>4:61. Removal by city.</h3>

<p>If snow or ice is not removed or treated as required section 4:60, the city may notify the owner or occupant of the violation of section 4:60. This notification may be made in person, by telephone, by mail or by written notice left at the property. If the owner or occupant fails to remove snow or ice within 24 hours of the notification of violation of section 4:60, the city may cause such snow or ice to be removed. The owner (as indicated by the records of the assessor) of the adjacent property shall then be charged the actual cost of the sidewalk clearance, plus an administrative fee of $50.00. If that charge is not paid within 45 days, it may be assessed against the parcel under section 1:292 of this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 83-70, 10-13-70; Ord. No. 46-77, 1-23-78; Ord. No. 81-81, 12-7-81; Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 2, 12-21-92)</p>

<h3>4:62. Financial hardship.</h3>

<p>Upon proof of financial hardship the Administrator may authorize charges under section 4:61 to be paid in installments, to be reduced, or to be cancelled and will be subject to Council approval.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 11-75, 2-10-75; Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86)</p>

<h3>4:63. Penalty.</h3>

<p>The owner (as shown on the assessor's records) of the property with adjacent sidewalks which do not comply with section 4:60, who fails to comply with the notice given in section 4:61, shall be responsible for a civil infraction, which shall be punishable by a civil fine of not less than $100.00 for the first offense, not less than $250.00 and up to $500.00 for the second offense, and not less than $500.00 and up to $1,000.00 for each additional or subsequent offense within a 2-year time period, plus costs and all other remedies available by statute.. The maximum fine for any offense shall not exceed $1,000.00. If the penalty is not paid within 45 days, it may be assessed against the parcel under section 1:292 of this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 5-86, 2-20-86; Ord. No. 77-92, § 3, 12-21-92; Ord. No. 25-04, § 4, 8-2-04)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'd like to do some long form writing, except that I'd publish it on Twitter. I'll write essays as I'd normally write them, making sure that sentences are 140 characters or less. The goal would be to encapsulate an entire argument in pithy sentences and make each one stand on its own. I have no doubt that it would be possible to write quite a few words this way, though you might lose some followers in the bargain.</p>

<p>The change of pace is that you're not trying to write your whole idea into any given 140 character fragment. You're looking to spin out a story that holds together over dozens of tweets, without being too distracted by the net you're writing within. Writing with a net watching can be distracting, but it can also be enlivening; somehow you must make use of the diversions. Some side conversations will give you ideas that you can later reclaim and recast as your own, when the time is right.</p>

<p>Twitter is a new medium within which to compose original writing, as every sentence you write there has its own URL and feedback loop. By publishing every sentence individually, you can write and then see feedback one line a time - a thought both inspiring and terrifying.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/">The Soul of Man under Socialism</a>, 1891. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing. Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been drafting first versions in vim so that I have a record of the whole context of what I'm writing outside of Twitter. Drafting in vim gives me a chance to write a whole paragraph and then push it to Twitter as separate sentences, once it makes sense. I always edit again within Twitter, where every character is counted for you forcing you to make tough decisions about what not to say. The short format of Twitter leads to better writing, since you must omit needless words to make a complex idea fit into its allotment. </p>

<p>My writing is slower when I feel the compulsion to construct an argument that still makes sense when divided into pieces. It's easier to write quickly when you don't have to think about the reaction to every word and phrase. The feedback has prompted a handful of offline drafts before committing to publishing - even "just" to publishing to Twitter. </p>

      <p>February 5, 2014: More than 623,000 customers were without power in the service area covered by PECO (Philadelphia, PA area) at the peak of an ice storm on Wednesday. This is the second worst storm that the company has reported, right behind Hurricane Sandy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Does email work anymore as a way to connect people who share the same interests, in the old-school Internet sense of the community that forms around a well-managed, well-moderated mailing list? I'm starting to think after having my inbox fill up with well-intentioned communications that the era of the mailing list is over, and with it the era of any other use for email except the purely transactional.</p>

<p>My email messages are relatively long (compared to IMs or tweets), relatively formal, and carefully composed. A single message will sit in my inbox for more than 24 hours before I feel ready to give it its due. In a world of instant messaging that looks more and more like an anachronism, as though I were pulling out a quill pen to communicate with when everyone else was merrily texting away.</p>

<p>I run some long-running mailing lists, and I've started to itch at the limitations of Yahoo Groups for community engagement and for attracting new people who don't really want their inboxes to fill up with chit-chat. There must be a better way. </p>

<p>(Ironically, I'll probably email this post out to one of those lists, and will get more comments back from the email than I will get from this blog.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I'd give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.</p>

<p>You can see it at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com">http://vielmetti.typepad.com</a>.</p>

<p>So far so good, I guess. I don't have strong preferences about it; the advantage is that more short posts fit on a page, making it easier to scroll through a lot of them. The disadvantage is that I don't know where the 40 word mark is, and there's no really obvious way to say "always excerpt the lead paragraph", which is what I want.</p>

<p>Fiddling with your blog is the traditional way not to write. If I had to fiddle more, I'd look for a design that worked better on mobile devices like my Android phone; the current design has a weird choice of fonts for blog title that comes out too small, and my CSS-fu is not adequate to the task of debugging and fixing it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/atlanta-snow-jam-2014-metro-commuters-recount-thei/nc5qF/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. And side streets? Even worse. Some people ditched their vehicles and set out on foot. Others tried to help stranded strangers. And many persevered, moving a few inches an hour toward home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, was set up to help stranded motorists, and it has spawned a <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zCPqWODXYzLY.kQ7WuEIEQXNs">Stranded Driver Shelter Map</a>, a clip of which is below.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Kroger, Walmart, and Home Depot have opened their stores as shelters, if you can get to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2622">Jeff Masters blog from Weather Underground</a> has the situation in detail.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dangerous winter storm swept through the Deep South on Tuesday, dumping 1 - 4" of snow and 1/4" - 1/2" of ice on a region unused to dealing with severe winter weather. Travel chaos resulted in many cities, and at least nine people died in storm-related accidents. Officially, 2.6" of snow fell at the Atlanta Airport from Winter Storm Leon, and snow amounts across the city ranged from 1.5" - 3.5". But with temperatures in the low 20s, and only 40 snow plows and 30 sand trucks to handle the snow, Atlanta streets and highways quickly turned into parking lots during the afternoon snow, as schools, businesses, and government offices all closed nearly simultaneously, sending a huge number of vehicles onto the roads. Atlanta experienced its worst traffic day of all-time, and thousands of motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles, with many spending the night sheltering in stores, stalled cars, or strangers' homes. A Facebook group dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, meant to connect stranded motorists with people willing to put them up for the night, had thousands of members by Tuesday night. Hundreds of children never made it home, and were forced to spend the night at their schools or at bus shelters. There were 940 confirmed traffic accidents in Atlanta, with more than 100 involving injuries, according to the Georgia public safety commissioner. It was Atlanta's worst driving day since the infamous Snow Jam of 1982, when 6" of snow also created traffic chaos, stranding thousands of motorists.</p>

      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c img-responsive" alt="Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon" title="Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>I'm rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it's easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.</p>

<p>So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945), David Sucher's "City Comforts" (2003), and <a href="http://www.mbenedikt.com/">Michael Benedikt</a>'s anthology "Cyberspace: First Steps" (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.</p>

<p>The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can't simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.</p>

<p>One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt's "Cyberspace". It's a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there's anything of common use that defines it, it's the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.</p>

<p>I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I'm stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that's true to the work? </p>

<p>One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for "vielmetti benedikt cyberspace" should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.</p>

<p>A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace">Goodreads</a> (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/31259">Librarything</a> (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20">Amazon</a>, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.</p>

<p>For every work, there's some chance that an echo of it will be online too; <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf">IEU in Turkey</a> has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.</p>

<p>What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? </p>

<p>I've carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What's more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.</p>

<hr/>

<p>noted as well:</p>

<p>An interview with Benedikt in <a href="http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;pff=1">AIGA</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.</p>

<p>I'm (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome. I wrote about it previously; it's an extension that suspends the processes of tabs you mark as inactive, so that they can be restored quickly. As a bonus, it's good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with "only" 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.</p>

<p>The Internet, in its infinite wisdom, has a lot of things competing for our attention. The only problem is that it's easy to save a tab group but as hard as ever to really mark a tab as closed. I'm sure there's some stable working set that I should keep going, but it's also satisfying to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet.html">decrease the n</a> by closing tabs.</p>

      <p>On the morning of 27 January 2014, AT&amp;T UVerse services appear to be suffering from DNS problems. A graph from <a href="http://downdetector.com/status/att">Down Detector</a> suggests that the problem is widespread.

<p>One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8). On my Mac, go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced ... > DNS and change the DNS server address.</p>

There are lots of reasons to want to use more art on this weblog. It's attractive, for one; it displays good taste to have interesting artwork to illustrate your points; and the reader who is tuned to the visual image has a lot more likelihood to appreciate a crisp image than they will a wall of text. That's all good.</p>

<p>I also am very aware that in most cases the works that I'd like to share references to are copyrighted, and in some cases (looking at you, Getty Images) the copyright holders have been aggressive in pursuing their digital rights.</p>

<p>I sigh in amazement at the companies set up to do wholesale copyright infringement, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/jklfa/jasper-johns-crosshatch/">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+image+search+jasper+johns&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_ZPkUsy9JZDaoATuzICwCQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1174&amp;bih=662#q=jasper%20johns%20numbers&amp;revid=321734900&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_">Google Image Search</a> and the like of this world that scoop up imagery wholesale and are not shy about reusing it for their own purposes. The hope is that the worst case is a DMCA takedown, and the best case is an artist who I'd ask permission of who would be thrilled to have a low resolution version of their illustration, photo, or artwork adorn this blog.</p>

<p>The artwork in question is from Jasper Johns; it's entitled 0-9 and, if the title of the image is to be believed, dates from 1958-1959. I don't know precisely which museum or collector owns this piece. If I can figure out exact credit, I'll share it. The image is used with the belief that a low resolution version of the original artwork is fair use. </p>

  <p>So now we all sit back and wait. If there is going to be a a permanent President named to start by the fall, we should hear the name in the next few months. If I hear any names start to surface, I'll certainly tap out the fourth installment of the Diary.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a recipes collection.</p>
<p>This was part of dinner last week - yum! I don&#39;t have the exact proportions in front of me so you&#39;ll want to be prepared to improvise.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Potatoes</strong>, peeled, cut to quarters; to fill lasagna pan; redskins would do well <br />Juice of 3 <strong>lemons,&#0160;</strong><strong>fresh squeezed</strong>&#0160;juice not stuff from bottles if you have it&#0160;<br />Greek <strong>oregano </strong>(though Mexican oregano worked OK too) <br /><strong>Olive oil</strong> <br />Water</p>
<p>Preheat oven to a good roasting temperature (450+ degrees).</p>
<p>Put the potatoes in the lasagna pan. Mix lemon juice, water, oregano, oil together; you are after something like a salad dressing, but since you&#39;re baking it the water will go away, so make sure there&#39;s enough oil. Besides, olive oil is good for you.</p>
<p>Pour the dressing over the potatoes, mix until everything is coated. Put in oven. Roast until starting to turn brown, about 40-50 minutes depending on your oven and your potatoes. If you don&#39;t have a lot of oil in the dressing, you may need to turn to keep things from sticking.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll bet it would be good to put a couple of organic lemon halves in there too to roast along with everything.</p>
<p>Remove from oven, test for doneness. Eat. Yum. Also good cold.</p>
<p>Some other lemon roasted potato recipes, for comparison: <br />- <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/corby/ct2000-12.htm">Corby&#39;s Table</a> from The Atlantic Monthly has a patates riganates recipe from a review of Aglaia Kremezi&#39;s &quot;Foods of the Greek Islands&quot; <br />- <a href="http://www.sandisrecipecorner.com/recipe488H.htm">Sandi&#39;s Recipe Corner</a>, adds stock <br />- <a href="http://www.dvo.com/recipe_pages/grilln/Greek_Garlic_and_Lemon_Roasted_Potatoes.html">Cook&#39;n</a>, adds dill and roasts over wood chips <br />- <a href="http://www.autumnjade.com/recipes/133.htm">Autumn Jade</a>, basically the same with exact proportions <br />- <a href="http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2001/greek/potatoes.html">Global Gourmet</a> calls these <strong>patates riganates</strong> and adds garlic <br />- <a href="http://creampuffsinvenice.typepad.com/cream_puffs_in_venice/2006/04/some_lemony_spu.html">&quot;Cream Puffs in Venice&quot; has some lemony spuds for you</a>, adapted from <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/907079">Cook This</a> by Amy Rosen.</p>
<p>and I&#39;m sure there are more recipes to be had!</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>One more recipe to go with this if you have any cold leftovers. Put a bed of spring mixed greens on a plate; I like the Asian mix we found at Farmer&#39;s Market. Cut some of these potatoes up and put on top. Add diced cubed cold roasted beets for color and flavor. Dress with some of the lemon-oil mix, with a little red wine vinegar added. Yum.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>To the Editor: </p>

<p>The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? </p>

<p>The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner's street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so. </p>

<p>What these people wish to know, then, is, if the city owns the streets and their shade trees and side walks, why the city should not itself build the sidewalks, do all grading and plant all shade trees? </p>

<p>It is undeniable that when a man builds his sidewalk it immediately becomes city property, and he has no more ownership of it than any other citizen. In fact, in a single day hundreds will use it when he uses it once. In short, it is built not for him, but for the public. Then why should not the public pay for it? </p>

<p>The building of sidewalks under the existing ordinance is a heavy burden upon very many citizens, some of whom have been compelled by their circumstances to borrow the money at interest to enable them to comply with the order of the council. This seems to your correspondent to be a matter worthy of deliberate consideration by the city fathers. The claim of these people is that the city, owning the streets, should itself put down all sidewalks, and spread the expense upon he general tax. </p>

<p>It may do no good to open up this question at this time; but the voice of the people should at least be heard in the matter, and this communication certainly expresses it in some degree. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a while, I come up with a really good idea. More often than not, I don't.</p>

<p>I'm content to work on systems that accommodate the work that leads to a steady sense of slow progress. The weblog piles one post upon another; every so often, the middle of the pile is most interesting, and you dust it off and bring it out again as if it were new. The wiki appreciates it when you fix a very small typo, change an "an" to an "a", tidy up a caption or resize a photo.</p>

<p>Progress is more often than not measured very slowly, if at all. Just try not to go backwards. </p>

<p>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It's fascinating to see people's attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.</p>

<p>What these tools don't easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. But that's a large part of the problem - the endless fascination gets in the way of applying fingers to the keyboard and creating something brand new.</p>

<p>It's easy to get distracted by the sorts of things that are meant to help you out. It's hard to be analytical and dispassionate about your past work while at the same time you're trying to create new work. Not everything worth writing has to rank highly on a search engine or get lots of referral traffic; sometimes, you just need to create something even if it's only for you to stretch your fingers. </p>

<p>I've been using a todo system <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">based on Github issues</a> for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be.</p>

<p>When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</p>

<p>After some reflection, I decided that the only way to make progress on this list was to dramatically prune it. That means taking some items off the list that I really do want to do eventually, it's just that I'm not focusing on them now because every time I look at them on the list I say "no". Crossing them off the list doesn't completely delete them, and when I need to revisit them I can reopen the issue.</p>

<p>The list is down to 30 now, and I'm careful not to add more than that without crossing something else off the list. It still has a few lingering things that haven't been done for a long time, but I have had my teeth cleaned, and what's more I can read through the whole thing in one sitting and usually say "yes" to some next task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grimshaw’s vivid fliers and posters for the legendary Grande Ballroom in the late 1960s featured artists such as the MC5, Cream, the Yardbirds and Paul Butterfield. His style went beyond psychedelic, and is instantly recognizable to rock poster fans, and highly collectible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grimshaw was best friends in childhood with the late MC5 singer Rob Tyner. He was also a part of revolutionary poet John Sinclair’s Rainbow People’s Party and the “Trans-Love Energies” artistic movement. Grimshaw was active from the late 60s until recently, doing new work for local appearances by The White Stripes and Patti Smith and publishing a book last summer with Leni Sinclair titled Detroit Rocks! A Pictorial History of Motor City Rock and Roll 1965 to 1975.</p>

  <p>In December 2011 the Ann Arbor District Public Library celebrated the 40th Anniversary of the Free John Now! Concert featuring John Lennon, in great style. The poster for the original concert is one of Gary’s most popular images. For the Ann Arbor events Gary drew a commemorative poster by hand. A group of Gary’s friends from the time organized a Hill Street House Reunion gathering and Gary was able to reconnect with many friends. The newspaper The Ann Arbor Sun is electronically available at <a href="http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org">freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org</a> thanks to the Library’s great effort. </p>
