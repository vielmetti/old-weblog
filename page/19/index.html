        <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.

From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
 It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-29-january-28-2014-atlanta-snowstorm-paralyzes-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome.

As a bonus, it's good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with "only" 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.

One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8).

        <p>There are lots of reasons to want to use more art on this weblog.

That's all good.
I also am very aware that in most cases the works that I'd like to share references to are copyrighted, and in some cases (looking at you, Getty Images) the copyright holders have been aggressive in pursuing their digital rights. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-25-id-like-to-illustrate-this-blog-more-but-im-cautious-about-appropriating-artwork/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>To the Editor: The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner's street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-22-about-sidewalks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It's fascinating to see people's attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.
What these tools don't easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-19-analysis-paralysis/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I've been using a todo system based on Github issues for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be.
When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-14-limiting-work-in-progress-vs-the-endless-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The world of power outage maps is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's BWL, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult.
If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-08-how-many-power-outages-are-there-in-the-nation/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It's bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. One of the things we're looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the emerald ash borer that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa) has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-the-impact-of-a-deep-freeze-on-the-emerald-ash-borer/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-oven-fried-potato-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done.
The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-still-answering-yesterdays-email-also-doing-yesterdays-todos/">&raquo;</a></p>
