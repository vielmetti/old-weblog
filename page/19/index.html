      <p>If there is going to be a snow day in the Ann Arbor area, where do you look?</p>

<p>My first inclination is on twitter, in the hopes that someone knows better than me in real time.</p>

<p>Snow days go on television: <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/subindex/weather/closings">Channel 2 snow day</a> listings, <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/weather/school-closings-alt/-/4714938/-/3nvw37z/-/index.html">Channel 4 snow day</a> listings, <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/subindex/weather/school_closings">Channel 7 snow day</a> listings. These all cover greater Metro Detroit.</p>

<p>Snow days go on the radio; check 24 hour news stations like <a href="http://wjr.com">WJR</a> 990 and <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/station/wwj-newsradio-950/">WWJ</a> 760.</p>

<p>Snow days are announced without the assistance of the media, e.g. <a href="http://a2schools.org/aaps/home">Ann Arbor Public Schools</a> which publishes directly.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My phone is either nearing the end of its useful life, or reaching the start of some new useful life; I'm not sure which.</p>

<p>Its one true calling is as a terminal for Twitter, and that task it does admirably. Everything else is marginal or slow at best. But Twitter and a fast keyboard makes up for all of that.</p>

<p>The phone in question is a Blackberry Pearl with one of those squooshed keyboards that makes typing an adventure but also lets the phone fit into very small places. I loathe the idea of getting an Android phone without a good keyboard, and an iPhone is just not appealing for the price. I don't need another Blackberry because, hey, I have my Twitterphone!</p>

<p>When all you have is a Twitterphone, every problem looks like Twitter. Need to search for a restaurant, report a problem with squeaky brakes, look for a weather report, pretty much anything - Twitter. And to the extent that your world is Twitter shaped, that's a reasonable excuse for a device to carry with you everywhere.</p>

<p>I am sure that if I got some other device, that some other strong point of it would come to the fore. I'm sure there's a perfect phone for Facebook, a ideal device for LinkedIn, a super handset for your employer's Android application. The question of search for "which device do I want" becomes impossible because you know that you will adapt to whatever you have rather than discarding it, to some extreme extent of making or losing friends because of what you hold in your hand.</p>

      <p>Tasks to take on at the end of filling up a paper notebook.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read through the whole thing, copying out the good parts. There are bound to be enough good parts that you want to save and remember some of them, and scanning them in is one way to preserve the rough qualities. Retyping a clean copy with additional notes inspired by the original is another way to manage that same task.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider shredding the bad parts. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/vacuum-0.html">Forgetting is as important as remembering</a>, and you can channel <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/03/note-to-self-15.html">15 minutes of Discardia</a> by getting rid of junk that is just taking up space. Of course this is a horror if it's a true laboratory notebook, but I'm not going to make that assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile an index of names. Figuring out who you were thinking of along the way is at least as interesting to methodically review as what you were thinking about, since the review process may be as simple as reconnecting with someone who sparked a great idea but with whom you haven't had that conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a suitable visual design for a new notebook. Figure out how to be inspired by the blank page again, and use a design that matches something that causes you to start the page full of ideas. A blank page can be more constraining than one that has some structure already filled in, and a great page layout can be inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what it is that you will be carrying with you every day. The only way to fill a notebook is to have it handy. Don't allow it to go unused simply because it isn't there, or because you don't have a pen or pencil always within reach.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The original of this was 5 short lines, and it got longer in the process of writing for the net. It also made me want to discard things in order to leave room for more conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract—Frequency dynamics is one of the most important measures of an electrical power system status. To better understand power system dynamics, an accurately measured wide-area frequency is needed. The concept of building an Internet-based real-time GPS-synchronized wide-area frequency monitoring network (FNET) was proposed in 2000 by Qiu et al., and this concept has been realized. The FNET system consists of frequency disturbance recorders and an information management system. The FNET has made the synchronized observations of the entire U.S. power network possible with very little cost for the ﬁrst time. This paper summarizes the implementation of the FNET system and shows some preliminary observations and analyses of the data that have been collected from the FNET.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR (December 5, 2011): There are a number of neighborhoods in Ann Arbor where there are citizens who receive newspapers, and "newspaper-like items", where the citizen does not pay for the newspaper.  We receive a free copy of the <a href="http://heritage.com/ann_arbor_journal/">Ann Arbor Journal</a>, and there are some neighborhoods where a number of students receive the <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> gratis.</p>

<p>Alas, not everyone who gets a free paper opens it up in time for it to be useful, and some of it turns into litter. Some of that litter is neighborhoods where people like to keep the streets tidy.</p>

<p>The Ann Arbor City Council is considering an anti-newspaper law, file <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1012148&amp;GUID=1523FCC1-2D7A-4D17-A493-82D6F2DE50F9&amp;Options=&amp;Search=">11-1470</a>, which would amend the city code regarding distribution of handbills. The document with proposed changes as of the November 21, 2011 meeting is on the Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository as <a href="http://a2docs.org/doc/303/">document 303</a>. The ordinance in this form was not voted on. The ordinance was again put in front of council on December 5, 2011, and then tabled.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> reported on the agenda item on the nights of the council meeting. Under the headline <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/11/21/ann-arbor-no-newspaper-law-delayed/">Ann Arbor: “No Newspaper” Law Delayed</a>, it wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The council postponed the ordinance revision to its next meeting, on Dec. 5, because the content of the proposed revision had not been disseminated to the public in a timely way before the meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the night of December 5, the Chronicle's article on <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/12/06/ann-arbor-tables-no-newspaper-law/">Ann Arbor Tables “No Newspaper” Law</a> cited three recent cases on unwanted delivery of newspapers, including City of Fresno v Press Communications (1994), Rowan v US Post Office (1970), and Tillman v Distribution Systems of America (1996).</p>

<p>When similar legislation went into place in Chicago, a blogger referred to this as a <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/huston/071020">free newspaper killing law</a>, and some amount of righteous pro-litter indignation noted that the founding fathers were in favor of free speech and newspapers.  The countervailing view from Baltimore refers to the free Thursday SunPlus newspaper as <a href="http://www.examiner.com/politics-in-baltimore/the-litter-problem-caused-by-the-thursday-sunplus-paper">littering and dumping</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/LBPNA">Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association</a> that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the <a href="http://annarborbridges.org">Stadium Bridges project</a> are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.</p>

<p>The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/fig6f_05_longdesc.htm">M4-9b</a>. But instead of being aligned as a pedestrian sign, it's pointed along the path that cars will see. We're hoping this won't cause cars to go the wrong way down a one way street, thinking that the pedestrian detour is the automobile detour. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ericscheie.com/">Eric Scheie</a> for the night time photo of pedestrian detour signage in the Lower Burns Park neighborhood. </p>

<p>Riots is of course a loaded word, but that's what the media and public safety is using. Some stories about this evening's firing of long-time Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, and Penn State president Graham Spanier, and the sometimes violent reaction on the Happy Valley campus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Jon) Wertheim: This university lost their president today. What Jerry Sandusky is to alleged to have done is some of the most grotesque stuff you'll ever read, but it seems to be all about Joe Paterno tonight. It's just interesting to see a new wave of emotion here. It's anger, and it's frustration, and I imagine tomorrow's going to be completely different. This story keeps jumping around.</p>

  <p>Crowds began to gather around 10 p.m. on Beaver Avenue. After police in riot gear told them to move along, the students moved to Old Main. They sang the alma mater, professed their love for Paterno and profanely denounced Sandusky. They pointed toward Penn State president Graham Spanier's still-lit office. Then, after a brief "back to Beaver" chant, the crowd returned to Beaver Avenue. </p>

  <p>The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year.

      <p>ANN ARBOR USA, November 5-7, 2011 (Vacuum News) - There were a series of earthquakes in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, but we didn't feel them here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p>Some maps and news from people who did feel the quakes follow. The data here are preliminary, and you'll want to go to the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usb0006klz.php">USGS page for the Oklahoma quake</a> for details, and <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/history.php">Oklahoma earthquake history</a> to figure out how normal this is. The <a href="http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov/">Oklahoma Geological Survey</a> is likely to also have excellent data. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/oklahoma-earthquake-sets-a-record.html">News coverage from the New York Times</a> quotes Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey; Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center; and Justin Reese, who runs the <a href="http://boomarangdiner.com/">Boomarang Diner</a> in Chandler, Oklahoma.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?</p>

<p>There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. The VC in turn provides value by vetting the value of the allegedly valuable trade secret and is prepared to say "that's not a secret, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Paul Baran started a company doing that in 1985</a>".</p>

<p>A crafty tradesman is perpetually disclosing some relevant fragments of their trade knowledge at all times, in part to demonstrate competence, and in part to test whether what they know is really true.</p>

<p>As far as disclosure of trade secrets goes, I'd be much more worried about details leaking out inadvertently via ill-considered partners and subcontractors than via an investor.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a>. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.</p>

<p>Google now has a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real time version of Google Analytics</a>, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it. It tells you in real time what pages are being looked at, where people are coming from to look at them, and which keywords and referring sites are driving traffic. It scratches some of the same itch that mybloglog used to scratch, when there's some kind of burst of news and you want to know what's going on in real time and not on tomorrow's reporting.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a> had something that GA doesn't have and really hasn't had: tracking of clicks not to the site you're looking at, but to something out there in the world that you linked to. That was great to use - and something that made it easy to see that you were successful as a blogger because you were driving traffic elsewhere. That's gone; maybe someone will build it, but maybe they won't.</p>

    <p>The creator of the C programming language and the co-author of the book of the same name has died.� Dennis Ritchie joined Bell Labs in 1967 and in addition to developing C was one of the developers of the Unix operating system at Bell Labs in the late 60s and in the 70s written almost entirely in C.C grew out of B which was derived by Ken Thompson from BCPL, developed at Cambridge University in 1966 by Martin Richards.</p>
    <p>I started programming in Fortran66, then played around with Ratfor, which was Fortran made to look like C, before buying my first copy of K&amp;R C.� For a Fortran programmer who also had to program some chunks in assembler to get around the limitations of Fortran, C was a liberation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.</p>
<p>The organization announced its new web site, <a href="http://northburnspark.org" target="_self">northburnspark.org</a> , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</p>
<p>Residents expressed their concerns about municipal and neighborhood issues to each other and to several area elected officials who are residents of the neighborhood, including Mayor John Hieftje, Councilman Christopher Taylor, Washtenaw County commissioner Yousef Rabhi, and the recently appointed city administrator Steve Powers. (Does Steve live in the neighborhood?) (Links to names?)</p>
<p>Noise was a concern shared by several citizens, who expressed their frustration that nearby religious services, University functions, special events and construction activity generated noise far beyond ordinary noise limits yet were exempted by permits or the University&#39;s special relationship as an autonomous body. (Link to noise articles?) (mention Big House run by name?)</p>
<p>Mayor John Hieftje addressed citizen concerns regarding crime, noting that overall crime statistics as measured according to the FBI&#39;s standard reporting criteria are down across the board. Hieftje was critical of the media&#39;s portrayal of crime issues and perceptions of crime. It was noted (by whom?) that the increased awareness of near-campus crime was due in part to the University&#39;s direct dissemination of crime information and alerts. (Explain the Cleary Act? Link to municipal maps?)</p>
<p>Residents in North Burns Park (who, specifically?) expressed specific concerns about parking in near-campus apartments, noting that landlords have converted back yards into parking lots in excess of the city standard of 4 on-site spaces for a (which, specifically?) apartment unit.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Who? A couple of petanque enthusiasts) described the courts which they had helped in getting installed at the northeast corner of Burns Park (on some date) and invited neighbors to join in their enthusiasm for the game. Petanque is a French game similar to (boules) or bocce, played with metal balls on a gravel court. Students at Burns Park Elementary School learn petanque as part of their PE classes, and (the couple) are looking forward to a June 2012 event to raise money for ALS (as part of A2A3).</p>
<p>Long term residents were happy to see each other again at this annual meeting event, and new residents were welcomed. About (how many, 35?) were in attendance. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 pm and residents ate some but not all of the cider and cookies provided before walking home.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 7, 11:30 p.m. - A house near the corner of Harpst Street and Tremmell Avenue was on fire on the evening of October 7, 2011. This photo is provided courtesy of Mike Nowak (@<a href="http://twitter.com/snackdog" target="_self">snackdog</a>) and is used with permission.

According to apartment resident Amanda Szot, there was no fire in the complex, despite the substantial amount of smoke seen there.</p>
<p>Smoke from the fire could be smelled all the way to north to East Stadium at Westminster, and as far east as East Stadium at Packard.&#0160;</p>

<p><a href="http://chezpim.com/bake/quince-caramel" target="_self">Quince caramel</a> from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious.</p>
<blockquote>The fuzzy, fragrant fruits stared at me from the countertop for a couple of days. I thought I would poach them in simple syrup and keep in the fridge. The sweetened quince and the poaching syrup make a wonderful topping for my morning yogurt. The batch that my neighbor Beccy and I made a couple of weeks ago is running out, so this would be a good time to replenish. Then the real inspiration struck, caramel! I could use the sweet poaching liquid to make quince caramels, combining two of my favorite things to eat in the world, caramel and quince – I just love quince, I even love a restaurant named after it. How wonderful would that be?</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://migraineur.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/slow-food-chicken-tagine-with-quinces/" target="_self">Chicken tagine with quinces</a> comes via The Migraineur, quoting a recipe from Larousse for the preparation but spicing it with a traditional tagine.</p>
<blockquote>Still mindful of all those recipes calling for bucketloads of sugar, I was curious about how a raw quince would taste. While preparing the dish, I cut myself a very fine sliver and ate it. The texture was like an Asian pear, pleasingly granular, but a lot drier. Mostly I got that wonderful flowery fruity fragrance. Encouraged, I cut myself a larger chunk. Wow! Talk about pucker. It was like sucking on an inferior teabag – quinces are clearly loaded with tannins. So, no, I don’t think quinces can be eaten raw. However, I am encouraged by this recipe to think that quinces do not have to be sweetened.</blockquote>
<p>Beef with Quince, aka&#0160;<a href="http://mamastaverna.com/beef-with-quince-moschari-me-kydonia/" target="_self">Moschari me Kydonia</a>, is a savory stew courtesy of Mama&#39;s Taverna.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<p>It’s not glamous-looking, that’s for sure, but the tartness of the quince makes it zingier than you’d expect. This is NOT a boring beef stew!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time it was del.icio.us, and it was the new cool way to use bookmarks and tagging, and I used it all the time. I put more than 10,000 bookmarks into the system. This was when Flickr was on the top of the world and before Facebook and Twitter had made much of a dent.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us turned into delicious.com, got bought by Yahoo. Some cool people started to work there supporting it. Yahoo gave it a loving embrace, and those cool people left to do other cool things. They warned me on their way out, and I moved <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">my 10,000 bookmarks</a> to <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_self">pinboard</a> and mostly stopped using both systems because I wasn&#39;t ready to invest heavily in something that other people didn&#39;t trust.</p>
<p>Yahoo sold delicious.com to the founders of Youtube, who now run a company called AVOS. By all accounts the transition hasn&#39;t gone very well, e.g. your most loyal users say that the system has been <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/avos-delicious-disaster-lessons-from-a-complete-failure/705" target="_self">mangled by carpetbaggers</a>. From Violet Blue on ZDNet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahoo! got caught with its finger on the trigger to kill Delicious, an amazing cry came up from the internets to save it. Then AVOS rode in on a white unicorn to save it. Yay!</p>
<p>But, no. What we got was our worst fears about the bubble, confirmed.</p>
<p>Delicious is a bitter lesson for everyone. It’s the difference between how people actually use a product versus how rich, out-of-touch knuckleheads think people&#0160;<strong>should be</strong>&#0160;using that product, all to further their own self-interests.</p>
<p>If you make a startup we like, such as Delicious: please don’t sell it.</p>

<p>Pinboard has been doing well, but it&#39;s a one-person show with a very modest balance sheet.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what to conclude about this phase of network history, other than to note that the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/07/cyberspace-is-gone.html" target="_self">anti-internet texts of the 1990s</a>&#0160;provide some small measure of solace, and that if you want to keep something that you find on the net&#0160;in order to find it again making a copy of it in addition to bookmarking it is appopriate.</p>

      <p>Facebook is changing, again; that&#39;s not really news, since it seems to change all the time. Some people will like it, some people will hate it, and for the most part people will get used to it since they always seem to.</p>
<p>I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. It&#39;s remarkable that even stuff from four years ago was relatively easy to dig up; to do the same task on Twitter is impossible at the moment, and blog archive systems could learn a thing or two as well.</p>
<p>I&#39;m never going to end up with all of my digital history tucked away neatly inside the Facebook world; for better or for worse, it&#39;s too messy to find and not worthwhile to even think how to relive enough of the past. Still, there&#39;s something appealing now to a system that really has a sense of time, and where things that are old don&#39;t disappear.&#0160;</p>

<p>--------</p>
<p>Saul and I went swimming today at the Y. The big pool was full of kids&#0160;taking lessons, and the little pool had 3 parents and their kids splashing&#0160;and kicking and in Saul&#39;s case swallowing a bit of water. The radio was&#0160;on rather loud in the lifeguard&#39;s office, with what sounded like NPR news&#0160;going. Earlier in the day we went to farmer&#39;s market - it&#39;s nearing the&#0160;end of the peach season, but there are peppers in abundance, and plenty of&#0160;tomatoes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely starting to be fall here, with leaves turning red on at&#0160;least one tree on my regular path downtown. [...]<br /><br />A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.<br /><br />By 11 am there were no copies of the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, or&#0160;even USA Today to be had from vending machines or from Borders.<br /><br />My immediate family is checking in, and everyone is accounted for.&#0160;I have three cousins in New York City, and my parents are visiting&#0160;my brother and sister-in-law in DC. There are stories to tell but<br />not now, I am not ready for that quite yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5R0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1304%2C767102" target="_self">Big rally on the Diag last night, something like 15,000 people were there</a>,&#0160;the&#0160;coverage from the student newspaper. We were putting Saul to bed at the&#0160;time.<br /><br />I spent far too much of Tuesday glued to the net, the radio, and to my&#0160;phone, and then late at night I finally hauled up our TV from the basement&#0160;and looked at some pictures.<br /><br />It&#39;s late now, and I don&#39;t really have a lot more to say. I would like to&#0160;hear what you are doing. I know that not everything is all right, but&#0160;even a few words about what your day is like, the sights and sounds around&#0160;you, would be nice to hear.<br /><br />For those of you who lost friends and loved ones yesterday, my&#0160;thoughts are with you.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee have made their way slowly from the Gulf of Mexico to the northeastern United States, bringing a storm with a slow-moving heavy rain. There is widespread flooding in the Susquehanna River basin and flash floods across the area. The Weather Underground&#39;s <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1921" target="_self">Jeff Masters has commentary on the storm</a> from the morning of September 8, 2011, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An extreme rainfall event unprecedented in recorded history has hit the&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBGM/2011/09/07/DailyHistory.html" target="_blank">Binghamton, New York</a>&#0160;area, where 7.49&quot; fell yesterday. This is the second year in a row Binghamton has recorded a 1-in-100 year rain event; their previous all-time record was set last September, when 4.68&quot; fell on Sep 30 - Oct. 1, 2010. Records go back to 1890 in the city. The skies have now cleared in Binghamton, with this morning&#39;s rain bringing the city&#39;s total rainfall for the 40-hour event to 9.02&quot;. However, another large region of rain lies just to the south in Pennsylvania, and all of the rivers in the surrounding region are in major or record flood. The Susquehanna River at Binghamton is at 25&#39;, its highest level since records began in 1847, and is expected to overtop the flood walls protecting the city this afternoon. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, Swatara Creek is 18&#39; over flood stage, and more than 8&#39; above its record flood crest. Widespread flash flooding is occurring across the entire area, and over 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.</p>
