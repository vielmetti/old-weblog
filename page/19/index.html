    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>To the Editor: The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner's street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-22-about-sidewalks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every once in a while, I come up with a really good idea. More often than not, I don't.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I've been using a todo system based on Github issues for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be. When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-14-limiting-work-in-progress-vs-the-endless-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The world of power outage maps is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's BWL, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult. If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-08-how-many-power-outages-are-there-in-the-nation/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It's bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. One of the things we're looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the emerald ash borer that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa) has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-the-impact-of-a-deep-freeze-on-the-emerald-ash-borer/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-oven-fried-potato-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done. The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-still-answering-yesterdays-email-also-doing-yesterdays-todos/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is current as of January 4, 2014. Check on the Municode web site for the absolute latest information, though it's unlikely that the ordinance will change. Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a "Snow Condition Yellow". From the City of Ann Arbor Facebook: The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-04-city-of-ann-arbor-snow-emergency-ordinance-10143/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Kai Petainen writes that the downtown "Library Lot" parking structure so full on New Years Eve that when everyone went to leave it at once, the lines were so long that people's paid tickets ran out of time. This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay. I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-01-ann-arbor-library-lot-exit-problems-on-new-years-eve/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>December 30, 31 2013: Two BNSF trains collided about a mile west of Casselton, North Dakota, setting the crude oil that one of them was carrying on fire. The toxic plume of smoke from the fire has led to evacuations of the city, which is 25 miles west of Fargo. The fire's black smoke is visible from space, as seen in the GOES satellite image below. Meteorologist Aaron White: The smoke plume from the train collision was large enough that it could be seen on the visible satellite imagery just before sunset. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-31-trains-collide-in-casselton-north-dakota-leading-to-giant-fireball-and-toxic-fire/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy of something I've already written and published somewhere else. That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into the ether too quickly (including this thread which will die quietly when we are all done with it). Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic discussion. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-30-facebook-where-its-hard-to-keep-a-conversation-going-and-find-it-again-later/">&raquo;</a></p>
