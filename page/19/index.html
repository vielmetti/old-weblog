<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.</p>

<p>Council discussed the situation in Portland, Oregon. <a href="http://consumerist.com/2013/05/20/when-you-cut-trash-collection-to-every-two-weeks-parents-will-still-find-a-way-to-get-rid-of-dirty-diapers/">Consumerist</a> notes that parents there are recycling their dirty poopy diapers. (ew.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It started when the city went to every other week garbage pickup,” the president of Far West Fibers, which handles much of the curbside recycling for Portland, tells Oregon Public Broadcasting. “Prior to that you’d get a dirty diaper maybe once a month. Now we get 60 pounds per shift. It’s not pretty.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ew.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-06-slow-obamacare-registration-denial-of-service-attack-or-self-inflicted-injury/">Slow Obamacare registration: denial of service attack, or self-inflicted injury?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">Healthcare.GOV</a>, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/05/us-usa-healthcare-technology-analysis-idUSBRE99407T20131005">Reuters took a look at the issue</a>, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. For instance, when a user tries to create an account on HealthCare.gov, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, it prompts the computer to load an unusually large amount of files and software, overwhelming the browser, experts said. If they are right, then just bringing more servers online, as officials say they are doing, will not fix the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/in-debut-affordable-care-web-site-baffles-many-users/">New York Times reported on the site's debut</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the site took three years to build, it took only a few minutes for it to break down when it went live at 8 a.m. E.D.T. Some consumers said they were met with an error message in the early morning when trying to visit the Web site, which seemed to be overwhelmed with traffic and limited by apparent programming issues. Many people took to Twitter and Facebook to note that the site was down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/04/obamacare-disaster-or-routine-maintenance/">MSNBC asks</a> - disaster or routine maintenance?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HHS officials said that they will be taking down the “application part of the website” for scheduled maintenance this weekend, according to NBC News’ Kristin Welker. The announcement was red meat for critics of Obamacare, who have been largely silent since the health care law rolled out earlier this week. Speaker John Boehner said the administration’s announcement was proof that “the president’s health care law has been an unmitigated disaster.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, no reliable reports that I've been able to find blame the problem on a specific denial of service attack; rather, it appears to be a combination of sudden demand for the service, teething pains for a new site, and system complexity. I did not note any commentary from the Arbor Networks <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/asert/">ASERT</a> weblog, which writes about DDOS attacks. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/">Renesys</a>, usually a useful view on problems, is reporting on Internet downtime in Sudan and Syria. My heads-up site for Internet-wide problems, the <a href="http://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages">outages mailing list</a>, is silent. Strangely, the place I'd expect to have seen this show up - the automated news aggregator <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/131007/p12#a131007p12">Techmeme</a> - is also quiet (Update: see below for Techmeme coverage). The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/obamacare">Obamacare Reddit subboard</a> has some reports from people who made it through the system, and others who are having problems.</p>

<p>More insights:</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the problems like these are in the software. Hardware is the easy part. You can add more hardware and do it easily. Software takes more time. In the rush of getting this out, it seems like testing wasn’t done completely. My expectations from this is that these problems should go away in the next few weeks. The site still won’t be as fast as something like Netflix, but it should work.</p>

  <p>I find it so telling of Americans if you can't get it within 4 days when you have 6 months to sign up we throw up our hands, have a temper tantrum and take our toys and go home. How about waiting a couple weeks and try again.</p>

  <p>Six days into the launch of insurance marketplaces created by the new health-care law, the federal government acknowledged for the first time Sunday it needed to fix design and software problems that have kept customers from applying online for coverage.</p>

      <p>What's on the agenda for the 7 October 2013 Ann Arbor City Council meeting?</p>

<p>(Pun Plamondon Addresses Ann Arbor City Council, Ann Arbor News, 1973)</p>

<p>From Sabra Briere, <a href="http://www.sabrabriere.org/First%20October%202013.php">First Ward News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By my count, this agenda includes 2 action items – 14 administrative acts, 8 infrastructure changes, 1 that address public safety needs, 0 investments in economic development and 0 that relate to affordable housing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Ann Arbor Chronicle, <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/04/ann-arbor-council-to-weigh-privilege-waiver/">Ann Arbor Council to Weigh Privilege Waiver</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A resolution that’s been added to the Ann Arbor city council’s Monday, Oct. 7, 2013 agenda would, if approved, result in the waiver of attorney-client privilege with respect to a specific advice memo that has already been written by the city attorney’s office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is about Al McWilliams, who was appointed by the Ann Arbor City Council on a 6-5 vote to join the Ann Arbor DDA; there is consideration that the vote requirement might have been 8 votes. There was talk that the minutes for the previous meeting might be contested as a result.</p>

<p>Again, from the Chronicle: <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/03/sidewalks-repair-build-shovel/">Sidewalks: Repair, Build, Shovel</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>City council's Oct. 7 agenda includes consideration of cross-lot walkways again, with a non-shoveling approach; also: sidewalks connect to projects for stormwater management and public art</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Agenda items include attorney-client privilege waiver related to appointment of Al McWilliams, approval of solid waste plan, cross-lot walkways, liquor license fees, Rockefeller Foundation grant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, from the Ann Arbor News - well, there's nothing yet from the Ann Arbor News telling you there would be a meeting on Monday, or what it would be. Look for something coming from the snooze's government reporter, <a href="http://connect.mlive.com/staff/ryanstanton/posts.html">Ryan Stanton</a>.</p>

      </h3>

Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.</p>

<p>Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer. The description of the resources used to take down Silk Road did not mention any specific attacks on Tor; the proprietor of Silk Road left behind enough clues through sloppy tradecraft that it was possible through diligent efforts to identify him based on his public postings. The takedown of Silk Road caused a disturbance in the Force as seen through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/10/bitcoin-volatility-after-silk-road-shutdown.html">volatility in Bitcoin prices</a> seen right after the system was taken down.</p>

<p>Most recently the Guardian printed a Bruce Schneier piece on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity">Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity</a>. It goes into detail on the flaws in browser implementations that can be used to attack Tor anonymity as well as the peculiar attacks that only the NSA can take out by doing monkey-in-the-middle attacks on the Tor (and Internet) infrastructure. It's a good read, and exposes such lovely NSA code names as "EgotisticalGiraffe".</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Schneier piece is that it's not impossible to unmask the anonymity of Tor users, especially if they are sloppy in any way in their use of the system; there are enough bugs to go around in the components that make up a typical Tor browser bundle that it's likely that a dedicated effort to entrap a specific user will succeed. But it's hard work, and thus the Tor system works as its Naval Intelligence designers intended - only the most determined state actor can foil typical use of the system.</p>

<p>The best reporting from the Capitol today was from people close enough to the scene to be an eyewitness, yet not trapped in the need as a news organization to put a coherent story around the whole matter until it was well and thoroughly over. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I&#39;m watching the whole thing from my office. The air&#39;s full of gunpowder smoke. It looks like police have the situation under control</p>&mdash; Berin Szoka (@BerinSzoka) <a href="https://twitter.com/BerinSzoka/statuses/385832218381152256">October 3, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Once it was over, you could make out the outlines of a story; as it was happening, it was hard to tell what was really going on, what with a "fog of war" situation and lots of people who weren't anywhere near the scene breathlessly retweeting accounts from other people who also weren't there. There are still loose ends, like the name of the shooter, a confirmation that she is deceased, the identity of a child, and the condition of a police officer in the incident.</p>

<p>Some news clips, for reference:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/gunfire-reported-outside-the-capitol.html">NY Times</a> - "WASHINGTON — The United States Capitol was locked down for about a half-hour on Thursday afternoon after law enforcement officers shot and killed a woman who had been chased there in her car from the White House, law enforcement officials said." </p>

      <p>Frank’s Restaurant is under new management – as of October 1, says the sign. They are advertising extended late night hours.</p>

<p>Frank's is well known as "the fortified high point of Ann Arbor", according to its menus.</p>

<p>I wrote about Frank's 6 years ago as part of a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/placeshout---ht.html">review of Placeshout</a>, which was a simple application for taking short (100 character) notes on locations. That was from the era of the Ann Arbor "nova mob", a cadre of people who could be counted on to use any new social or review site and instantly propel Ann Arbor to the top of the list for cities reviewed, second usually only to San Francisco. Placeshout is gone (without even a goodbye message), and the nova mob has scattered to the winds. But Frank's is still here, and good luck to its new management.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here's a 24 hour snapshot from the <a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity</a>. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Why the volatility? It turns out that a popular Bitcoin trading site, Silk Road, has been shut down by the Feds. Silk Road was known for its free and easy Bitcoin-fueled trading in drugs, and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002">indictment alleges</a> that the proprietor, a certain Ross William Ulbricht, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts," also used the site to plan a contract "hit" on someone who crossed his path.</p>

<p>I went to an organizing meeting Monday 30 September 2013, here's a few things I saw.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ArborWiki">ArborWiki template</a> on Wikipedia!</li>

<p>Combine this with the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:ArborWiki">pages that link to this template</a> and you get a short list of forward links from Wikipedia to Arborwiki. There's a similar page of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Entries_with_pages_in_Wikipedia">Arborwiki entries with pages in Wikipedia</a> that completes the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikimedia Commons has a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Buildings_in_Ann_Arbor,_Michigan">Buildings in Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> category with more than 100 photos of the area.</p></li>

      </h3>
      <p>A power outage on a 138,000 volt line that provides power to Metro North trains in New York has snarled commutes from Connecticut to New York City and has also affected Amtrak service in the busy New York - Boston corridor. Work is underway to put in a temporary fix by diverting power from surrounding businesses and neighborhoods. A backup feeder line was offline, and full service restoration may take weeks.</p>

<p>Metro North is responding by putting diesel trains into service and by running buses to try to accommodate the 130,000 daily commuters on the line, but this provides only about a third of the capacity needed for a normal commute.</p>

<p>NY Times, "Power Failure Disrupts Metro North’s New Haven Line; May Last Days", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/metro-norths-new-haven-line-suspended-after-power-loss.html">September 25, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disruption began after a Consolidated Edison feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed around 5:20 a.m., snarling service between Stamford, Conn., and Grand Central Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CT Post, "Metro-North, Con Edison tested plan that led to failure", <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Metro-North-service-What-you-need-to-know-4845143.php">September 26, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it may take officials weeks to determine the cause, it appears the 138,000 volt line that was left to bear the burden of energizing trains along an eight-mile stretch of track in Westchester County, N.Y., from Pelham to Rye became overwhelmed and superheated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg Business Week, "Delayed NYC Commuters Ask Why Metro-North Power Failed Again", <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-09-27/stranded-nyc-commuters-ask-why-metro-north-power-failed-again#p1">September 27, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said yesterday that Con Edison representatives told him the company is working to get a portion of the electricity needed to the commuter line. The power would come from three transformers to be tested this weekend, Malloy said. He said updates will be provided to residents the night before the Sept. 30 commute. “There appears to have been little plan for this type of catastrophic failure,” Malloy said during the briefing at Grand Central.</p>

      <p>As noted from a post on <a href="http://marketingland.com/twitter-quietly-adds-website-analytics-youll-love-it-60243">MarketingLand</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can see all the tweets that link to your website, whether or not they include your @username. You can see tweets that link to any specific page on your website. You can see how often Twitter users click on links to your website, or to any specific page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To do this, go to <a href="https://ads.twitter.com/accounts/75k/websites">the new Websites link under Analytics</a> and claim your web site by putting a meta tag in the "head" section of your site. (Typepad users will find this under Design &gt; Head). Once you've claimed your site, you can then see analytics performance on a per-hour or per-day level.</p>

<p>This weblog gets enough hits from Twitter that I'm curious where they come from; the new Twitter tools help that curiosity. If you were managing a brand and wanted to see how effective your twittering was, this is one more measurement tool for you.

<p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck.</p>

<p>The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.</p>

<p>It's very different writing for someone else than it is for myself. Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor is not one of them. Rather, there's a terrifying time when you hit "publish" and the world either sees your headline and says "meh" or they pick it up and share it with their friends.</p>

<p>Ultimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I've written here before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unpolished-open-notebook.html">keeping an open notebook</a> and what that means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing. But when you're writing for someone else the whole package really wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a separate set of expectations.</p>

  <p>Some weaselly-looking character from an outfit called "Just Energy" knocked on our door today. They are of course scam artists and we just tell them we are not interested. They are very pushy and actually try to mislead people into thinking they have something to do with the utility companies. The especially like to prey on the elderly. </p>

  <p>When dealing with a person who shows up at your door unannounced or without prior notification (be it a cable provider, maintenance worker, plumber, salesperson) exercise healthy levels of caution and care before agreeing to anything. If a person shows up at your door without proper notification, promptly ask to see an ID, business card or supervisor’s phone number before conducting any further business. If an individual is unable to provide any of the aforementioned forms of identification, discontinue the interaction. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To assess and monitor the needed changes, the ICC ordered Just Energy to pay for an independent audit completed last year. The previously confidential document said that between 2010 and 2011 Just energy received over 29,792 complaints. “It’s really an astonishing figure, the 29,000 complaints. We have never seen anything like that,” said David Kolata, the head of the Citizens Utility Board.</p>

  <p>ENDICOTT -- As we've reported, Binghamton police say scam artists are going around telling local residents they can help them with their utility bills during these cold months if they sign up with a company called "Just-Energy". Police say it's a rip off.  Richard Torres Maldonado says his family was a victim to the scam and their electric bill went from $40 to $300. </p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b" alt="Logo" title="Logo" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I've started using <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> to organize several groups. Here's some notes.</p>

<p>For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 meetup</a> which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</p>

<p>A brand new Meetup is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech</a> Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup, which had its first meeting the other night. This is a more classic meetup, one that tries to meet monthly rather than weekly, one that's similar to other groups around the country, and one where I'm starting out from the perspective that I mostly don't know everyone who's going to be interested.</p>

<p>Meetup is a form of civic technology (for the purpose of organizing meetings). For a2civictech, I've been able to use the function of annotating the photos from the meeting to remember who was there, and the little discussion forum around the event is just enough to prepare for meetings and remember what happened there. Meetup also allows you to track the input and output of money to the group, so it's reasonable to track expenses and reimbursement for even little bits of money.</p>

<p>The meetup system isn't free; a semi-annual fee of $72 applies. So by not being free it gives me the opportunity to have other folks help share in the cost of running things. a2civictech is sponsored in part by <a href="http://a2geeks.org">a2geeks</a> and that's been a great plus in getting it going. You can also share in the roles of actually organizing things by giving co-conspirators some additional rights to manage things.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most is that Meetup is actually designed pretty well to help you successfully organize a meeting. I'm so used to group-forming tools like Yahoo Groups and Google Groups where the goal is to have a discussion online and where the in-person efforts are a very late afterthought. The system comes with a checklist of all of the useful things you can do, and the automated emails for the event planner gently prompt you to do the right thing at the right time. There's obviously a lot of thought and evolution in this system which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>The verdict so far: worthwhile to continue for 6 months, and probably worth renewing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.</p>

<p>Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:</p>

<li><a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw/">AllRecipes</a> adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing</li>

<li><a href="http://www.bostonorganics.com/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw/re/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw">Boston Organics</a> follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint</li>
<li><a href="http://www.floatingkitchen.net/kohlrabi-slaw-kohl-slaw/">The Floating Kitchen</a> adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.</p>

<p>The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. If something particularly interesting comes as a result of this expedition through public records, a second request should be straightforward since you know that relevant records exist because someone else already got them.</p>

<p>One of the possible problems in asking for FOIA logs is if the public body in question has multiple parts of it that answer FOIA requests, and your seemingly simple request has to get allocated to multiple places. I think this is the reason that both the City of Ypsilanti and Wayne State University asked for more than $60 in fees to retrieve a month's worth of logs - I think, but am not certain, that the fees reflected the need to go both to the administrative side of routine FOIAs as well as to police department FOIAs for the same period.</p>

<p>The bright spot in all of this has been the City of Ann Arbor, which responds promptly and without fees for requests for city FOIA logs. Every single request is numbered, so that you can be certain that you're getting the whole set, and I specifically didn't ask for police logs in that case.</p>

<p>My naive assumption going into this was that every agency would be able to produce a stack of letters that they had received for FOIA requests with minimum cost and minimum search time. That proved not to be the case. I'll need to dig deeper the next time I send such a query in to make sure I'm not inadvertently asked for too much.</p>

<p>Those interests can be quite wide-ranging, as seen by this discussion of <a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/drug/oxycontin/THI9F0V07VFJGT90Q">where to get heroin</a>. And while I'm not surprised when I see discussions of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/meet-the-dread-pirate-roberts-the-man-behind-booming-black-market-drug-website-silk-road/">drug dealing on the dark networks</a>, it's always a bit of a shock to see people typing this stuff into the clear on comment boards on a "news website".</p>

      <ol>
<li><p>Identify the toilet tank in the basement that no one uses that's leaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Squirt WD-40 on the stuck valve on the supply line to the tank.</p></li>
<li><p>Use elbow grease and a vise-grip to turn the supply line valve to "off".</p></li>
<li><p>Remind people not to use the toilet.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your daily usage to see that instead of using 200 units of water on a slow day, you're using 50 (!).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't want to guess how much water (and money) was leaking down the drain, but I think I have this problem fixed for now. The next step is to replace or repair the toilet, but until then, at least it won't be a source for high water bills.</p>

<p>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">City of Ann Arbor</a> for having <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/ann-arbor-water.html">detailed daily water billing</a> information online. It would only be better if they published average daily usage numbers so that you could benchmark yourself against other citizens, or if you could set alerts or alarms on your usage so that if it went over a certain amount you could get notified to see what was wrong.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From a transcript of an 18 September 2013 interview on <a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now</a> about the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/18/the_1_000_year_flood_did">aftermath of the 2013 Colorado floods</a>. Jim Pullen is a reporter at Colorado radio station <a href="http://www.kgnu.org/">KGNU</a>, an independent community station in Boulder and Denver. Hyperlinks are my own.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NERMEEN SHAIKH: And when do you expect to learn, Jim Pullen, of the extent of the environmental contamination as a result of these floods?</p>

<p>JIM PULLEN: That, I think that is going to take some weeks, very unfortunately. There are two things going on — well there are several things that are going on that are of incredible concern. Of course, in any flood event, there are going to be a lot of contaminants in the water. There are going to be dead animals, there are going to be — there are oil stations — gasoline stations that have been inundated. People’s homes have been inundated, and people keep a lot of chemicals in their homes that are under relatively low protection.</p>

<p>We have some very serious issues here in the state of Colorado in addition to those normal flooding issues. We have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">Rocky Flats plant</a>, or what was once upon a time the Rocky Flats Plant where plutonium is underground. And there has been extensive flooding in that area. And we also have tens of thousands of active oil and gas wells in the state, 20,000 alone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weld_County,_Colorado">Weld County</a>. The industry — a lobbying group is reporting 1900 of those oil and gas wells have been shut down, and including the two largest suppliers, <a href="http://www.nobleenergyinc.com/">Noble Energy</a> and <a href="http://www.anadarko.com/">Anadarko</a> are reporting about five to ten percent of their wells have been shut down.</p>

<p>For example, Noble Energy owns 7600 wells in Weld County itself, which is right to the northeast of us. So, there are a lot of contaminants potentially floating around. And in the case of Rocky Flats, I spoke with a Christine Everson (ed. note: <a href="http://www.kristeniversen.com/">Kristen Iversen</a>?) last night and she said it is going to take weeks for laboratory results of plutonium and other contaminants to become available to the public.</p>

<p>Notes: A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24107038/state-and-industry-struggle-assess-damage-flooded-oil">Denver Post story</a> of September 16 further reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colorado's richest oil field — the Denver-Julesburg Basin — is buried in floodwaters, raising operational and environmental concerns, as state and industry officials work to get a handle on the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Thousands of wells and operating sites have been affected — some remain in rushing waters, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>"The scale is unprecedented," said Mike King, executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. "We will have to deal with environmental contamination from whatever source."</p>

<p>Notes: Another Denver Post story with breaking news of an <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/environment/ci_24126403/5-250-gallons-oil-spills-into-flood-swollen">oil spill on the South Platte River</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MILLIKEN — Industry crews have placed absorbent booms in the South Platte River south of Milliken where at least 5,250 gallons of crude oil has spilled into the flood-swollen river.</p>
  
  <p>The spill from a damaged tank was reported to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Wednesday afternoon by Anadarko Petroleum, as is required by state law.</p>
  
  <p>State officials have responded to the spill site, which is south of Milliken near where the St. Vrain River flows into the South Platte.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Anna Clark, writing in the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/advance_changes_gears_ann_arbor_mlive.php?page=all&amp;print=true">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.</p>

<p>The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. Further, I want to make very clear the difference between urgent breaking news and the sort of slog it out, cover it every day beat journalism that is mostly interesting in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Twitter has always been good for breaking news, whether it be local, national, or global. I'm perfectly convinced that in the case of the 100-year flood, we'll be covered. There's enough individual people who are capable of writing about what's happening to them in enough local detail that if an issue is city or county wide, Ann Arbor will be notified. Newspapers always do their best work in response to crisis, and local bloggers, radio, and metro Detroit television will all chip in. If something horrible or wonderful happens, we're all good as far as news goes.</p>

<p>That can't be said for every town, by the way. When Marshall, Michigan had an Enbridge pipeline burst in its midst, there was no local news media to write about or blog about the weird hydrocarbon smell. Ann Arbor has enough of a "diffuse media ecosystem" that such things should be noticed! However, you can't even count on that - a long-seeping sewer spill in the Arboretum was unnoticed for weeks - you'd hope that we'd catch something faster here.</p>

<p>It's the problem of news that's not urgent that I'm more worried about. Small retail businesses come and go, and you can't count on the Ann Arbor News to write about all of those retail changes. Crime, petty and otherwise, gets reported when the police department wants it to be reported, and thus you'll see a lot more Ypsilanti crime in the Ann Arbor paper than Ann Arbor crime just because of the willingness of YPD to share. The <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> does a fine job of bird-dogging city council, but its ferociously detailed coverage only extends so far. The <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> only comes out monthly, but it routinely scoops the daily media.</p>

<p>Short of finding someone with more money than sense to start a new publication, what can  you do? The CJR story says that people turn to "small independent news sites to fill in the gaps." As the Ann Arbor News shrinks, the opportunity to fill in the gaps should only grow. A narrowly focused topic that's interesting and that the dwindling mainstream media only gives cursory attention to would be perfect, and if you can give the world quick and accurate writing as well as compelling photography you'll be all set.</p>

<p>Small independent news sites are usually a labor of love, in some fashion. Notably they come and go as people's priorities change or as they age out of the "independent grad student blogger" demographic. It's almost the case that you need to recruit a new crop of writers every fall, purging your blogroll of the recently departed and scouring the net for the newest up-and-coming.So the local media infrastructure is active - there's no shortage of writing about Ann Arbor, both in local and in national publications. It's also incredibly diffuse, without a single dominant comprehensive news source that covers everything in detail. My best solution to date has to be tuned in to Twitter to catch what I can as it goes past, and write down what I see that's not getting enough notice so that I can contribute my small share.</p>

  <h3>13 September 2013</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-listening-to-baseball-online-with-global-tuners-radio/">Listening to baseball online with Global Tuners radio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a>. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).</p>

<p>First, you'll need a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a> account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. The way it works is that the receivers are hooked up to a digital front end that lets you tune them remotely and that plays back the audio through the net. In general only one person can tune in at a time, so it's first come first served. </p>

<p>Second, you'll need to have some idea of which AM and FM stations your favorite team's radio network covers. For example, the <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/schedule/radioaffiliates.jsp">Detroit Tigers radio network</a> has AM and FM station ranging from Houghton in the U.P. to Toledo Ohio and Angola Indiana, and the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp">Houston Astros radio network</a> also covers San Antonio and Shreveport. If the Tigers play the Astros, you can possibly tune to either network's stations - you'll either get home or away team coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, and here's the tricky part, you'll want to figure out which of the tuners covers which of the stations you are interested in. As it happens none of the tuners cover any stations that the Tigers routinely broadcast on, but the Astros are on KTKR 760 AM <a href="http://www.ticket760.com/main.html">Ticket 760</a> in San Antonio, and there's a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/info.php?r=1155">receiver in San Antonio</a> that might be free to listen through to them.</p>

<p>Figuring out radio channels can be weird - some stations have higher power and transmit over clear channels for long distances, and others don't cover much more ground than the city they are based in. So the "best" channel to tune in might be for a station that's powerful but far away. When you search through the MLB.com site for stations, look for the "flagship" station listed, which often broadcasts with higher power and over a greater distance than the other stations in the network. As an example, here's a report of <a href="http://globaltuners.blogspot.com/2011/10/knbr.html">hearing the San Francisco Giants</a> from a tuner in Phoenix, AZ more than 600 miles away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signal was weak at a distance of over 650 miles, with little interference from other stations but some noise and fading.  Nonetheless, the content was usable and the station IDs clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hobby of DXing gets an extra boost when you can tune in to radios that are far away. It's fun to scan the dial and hear what's out there. Most tuners have a band scan listing that you can see what's there. I listen to remote radio stations on <a href="http://www.tunein.com">Tunein</a> as well, but there's not the same sense of being there when the reception is too perfect, and the baseball powers that be block internet-based games over regular radio channels.</p>
