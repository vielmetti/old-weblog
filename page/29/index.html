<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Compiled hastily, here&#39;s a summary of today&#39;s Hacker News top 10. Based solely on the top 10, it&#39;s a slow news day.</p>
<p>1. &quot;If you try to get several regular polygons to meet snugly at a point in the plane, what’s the most sides any of the polygons can have? The answer is 42.&quot; (<a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/42/" target="_self">Azimuth Project</a>) Some observations of mathematical questions for which the answer is 42 or a multiple thereof, in time for <a href="http://towelday.org/" target="_self">Towel Day</a>.</p>
<p>2. He took the $300k bonus (<a href="http://boundary.com/blog/2013/05/26/i-took-the-300k/" target="_self">Cliff Moon</a>), a follow up to yesterday&#39;s account of someone who didn&#39;t (<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html" target="_self">Tom Preston-Warner</a>). It turned out well for both of them.</p>
<p>3. &quot;How far out is it possible to overhang blocks from the edge of a table without them toppling?&quot; The answer, surprisingly, is infinitely far. (<a href="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/may32013/index.html" target="_self">DataGenetics</a>)</p>
<div>4. Paypal has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. (<a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/163" target="_self">Robert Kugler, Full Disclosure</a>) Paypal pays bug bounties for people who find problems, but only to people over 18; the researcher who located this defect is a 17 yr old German student.</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. &quot;In 2012, under threat from fundamentalist rebels, a team of archivists, librarians, and couriers evacuated an irreplaceable trove of manuscripts from Timbuktu at great personal risk.&quot; Help save a library in exile, there&#39;s more work to be done. (<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/timbuktu-libraries-in-exile" target="_self">Kickstarter</a>)</div>
<div></div>
<div>6. Rustboot is a tiny 32 bit kernel written in Rust. (<a href="https://github.com/charliesome/rustboot" target="_self">Charlie Somerville</a>, Github)&#0160;Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language oriented toward concerns of “programming in the large”.

<div></div>
<div>9. Twitter is a big deal because &quot;it&#39;s a new messaging protocol, where you don&#39;t specify the recipients. New protocols are rare.&quot; (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/twitter.html" target="_self">Paul Graham</a>, 2009)</div>

      <p>The top 10 stories on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_self">Hacker News</a> this instant, summarized quickly. It&#39;s taking me about 3 minutes per article to read and digest it well enough to write down a few words about it.</p>
<p>1. Poll: &quot;What is your hourly rate, or your monthly salary converted into hourly rate (divided by ~165 hours) in USD?&quot; (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5769348" target="_self">csomar</a>) Much discussion in the comments as to whether people are charging too little.</p>
<p>2. 98% of venture capitalists aren&#39;t dumb (<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/05/25/as-populist-as-it-may-feel-98-of-vcs-arent-dumb/" target="_self">Mark Suster</a>), a response to &quot;Dear Dumb VC&quot; (<a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/e17153fde5f1" target="_self">Andy Dunn</a>). Hot entrepreneur vs. VC action.</p>
<p>3. Google has dropped XMPP for federated chat in favor of its own chat protocols that don&#39;t interoperate, and an XMPP protocol standards engineer is not happy about it. (<a href="https://plus.google.com/116276248303121270590/posts/ggNwh9eLYWu" target="_self">Ralph Meijer</a>)</p>
<p>4. A $300,000 salary from Microsoft is not enough enticement, and Github&#39;s co-founder relates his leaving Microsoft in 2008 to start Github. (<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html?" target="_self">Tom Preston-Werner</a>)</p>
<p>5. Open plan offices are bad for worker health and productivity, and older workers especially hate the noise. (<a href="http://qz.com/85400/moving-to-open-plan-offices-makes-employees-less-productive-less-happy-and-more-likely-to-get-sick/#" target="_self">Quartz</a>)</p>
<p>6. &quot;This tutorial will teach you the main ideas of Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning.&quot; (<a href="http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial" target="_self">Stanford</a>) It&#39;s written in a wiki, and is available in both English and Chinese.</p>
<p>7. You need to know these HTML5 features: DNS prefetching, link prefetching, the download attribute, regular expressions for input santization, and the datalist element for autocomplete suggestions. (<a href="http://daker.me/2013/05/5-html5-features-you-need-to-know.html" target="_self">Adnane Belmadiaf</a>)</p>
<p>8. To transform the lives of poor individuals in Uganda, give people cash. They will use it to train themselves and their incomes will go up. (<a href="http://chrisblattman.com/2013/05/23/dear-governments-want-to-help-the-poor-and-transform-your-economy-give-people-cash/" target="_self">Chris Blattman</a>)</p>
<p>9. Don&#39;t even consider programming in a language that allows you to have null pointer exceptions, and avoid languages that are dynamically typed. (<a href="http://sebastiansylvan.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/language-design-deal-breakers/" target="_self">Sebastian Sylvan</a>)</p>
<p>10. &quot;Different from line-based or character-based diff, ydiff is “language-based”. It parses the programs and then performs structural comparison on the parse trees.&quot; (<a href="http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/ydiff/" target="_self">Yin Wang</a>)</p>

<hr />
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Jay Gatsby</strong>&#0160;is the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_role#Title_character" title="Title role">titular character</a>&#0160;of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>&#39;s 1925 novel&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>. The character has become an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">High society</a>&#0160;and the name has become synonymous with successful businessmen with shady pasts in the US.</p>
<h2>Character biography</h2>
<p>James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gatz, a bright young man from a poor family in North Dakota, despised the imprecations of poverty so much he dropped out of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Olaf_College" title="St. Olaf College">St. Olaf College</a>&#0160;in Minnesota after only a few weeks because of his shame at the janitorial job he had to take to pay his way. While training in 1917 to join the infantry and fight in&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>&#0160;he meets and promptly falls in love with the beautiful Daisy, who represents everything he is not: she is rich, from a patrician East Coast family and born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth. After the war, from which he emerged as a hero for his participation in the bloody battles of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Marne" title="Battle of the Marne">Marne</a>&#0160;and&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Argonne" title="Battle of Argonne">Argonne</a>, he attends&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford" title="Trinity College, Oxford">Trinity College</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>. While there he receives a letter from Daisy telling him she has married the equally aristocratic Tom Buchanan. Rather than admit defeat, he commits his life to becoming a man of the sort of wealth and stature he imagines could win her love.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gatz returned home to an America transformed by&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">prohibition</a>&#0160;in 1919, a period in American history in which gangsters earned the sort of vast wealth previously the domain of the connected upper classes, an era in which &quot;all the old boundaries that separated the classes were being broken, and a new wave of instant millionaires, like Gatsby himself&hellip; mingled with the polo-players who inhabited the stiff enclaves of the established rich of Long Island&#39;s gold coast.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&#0160;This era later came to be known as the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age" title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</a>, after Fitzgerald&#39;s own coinage.</p>
<p>Gatz, who renamed himself Jay Gatsby, made a fortune in bootlegging thanks to his association with gangsters like Meyer Wolfsheim (patterned after real-life American gangster&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rothstein" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a>) and sets himself up in a mansion in the fictional West Egg, Long Island, a haunt of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux_riche" title="Nouveaux riche">nouveaux riche</a>&#0160;and across from the old-line money East Egg, where Tom and Daisy Buchanan live. Gatsby hosts wild parties, open to all comers, there every weekend, in the hopes that Daisy will attend and he can win her heart. He eventually catches up with Daisy, but fails to convince her to leave Tom. After his failure to change Daisy&#39;s mind is clear to all but him, Daisy drives Gatsby&#39;s car with Gatsby in the passenger seat and she accidentally strikes and kills Myrtle, the lover of her husband Tom, in a hit-and-run accident. Myrtle&#39;s jealous husband George tracks the car back to the Buchanan home, where Tom lies and tells him that Gatsby was the driver of the car that killed his wife. George goes to Gatsby&#39;s house, finds him floating in his lavish pool, and murders him before taking his own life. Almost none of Gatsby&#39;s high society friends attend his funeral and in the meantime Gatsby&#39;s underworld connections begin picking through his belongings in his mansion.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Gatsby as a reference point</h2>
<p>The figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America.&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mathews" title="Chris Mathews">Chris Mathews</a>&#0160;in his book&#0160;<em>American</em>&#0160;even forgives Gatsby his serial lies. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy&#39;s, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because &quot;all my ancestors have been educated there&quot; Mathews sees him as the eternal American striver. &quot;Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had&#0160;<em>always</em>&#0160;had it&hellip; this blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy&#39;s specifications is the heart and soul of the&#0160;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>. It&#39;s the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>&quot;Jay Gatsby&hellip; appears to be the quintessential American male hero. He is a powerful businessman with shady connections, drives a glamorous car&hellip; and pursues the beautiful, privileged Daisy,&quot; Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson write.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;In the Handbook of American Folklore, Richard Dorson sees Gatsby as a new American archetype who made a decision to transform himself after his first chance encounter with his mentor Dan Cody, who opens the door to riches in boot-legging. &quot;The ragged youth who some months later (after Gatsby drops out of St. Olaf) introduces himself to a degenerate yachtsman as Jay Gatsby has explicitly rejected the Protestant ethic&hellip; in favor of a much more extravagant form of ambition.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Referring to real life figures as&#0160;<em>Gatsby</em>&#0160;has been common in the United States, usually in reference to rich men whose rise to prominence involved an element of deception. In a story on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Foster_Winans" title="R. Foster Winans">R. Foster Winans</a>, a reporter for the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>&#39;s&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column who was fired after it was discovered he was giving advance knowledge of the columns&#39; contents to Peter Brant, the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post_Intelligencer" title="Seattle Post Intelligencer">Seattle Post Intelligencer</a>&#0160;described Brant as &quot;Winan&#39;s Gatsby.&quot; The article noted that Brant had changed his name from Bornstein and said he was &quot;a man who turned his back on his heritage and his family because he felt that being recognized as Jewish would be a detriment to his career.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&#0160;The&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column often effects the prices of the stocks it mentions.</p>

      <p>An attempt to catch the top news of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_self">Hacker News</a> on a Friday evening and summarize the top 10 stories; I won&#39;t make any decisions about what should be in the top 10, just note them here with a summary. It took me about 30 minutes to summarize 10 stories, without being selective about which ones were important.</p>

      <p>This is breaking news, and this blog post will be out of date.</p>
<p>The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River has collapsed near Mount Vernon, Washington. A map shows where the incident happened, about half way between Seattle and the Canadian border.</p>

Three people were rescued from the water with minor injuries.</p>

<p>The I-5 Skagit River Bridge is a through-truss bridge that was built in 1955, according to the website Bridgehunter.com. It is the same basic type of design of the Interstate 5 Bridge over the Columbia River in Vancouver, according to the site.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here are some notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of May 22, 2013. They are in no way reflective of everything that was discussed at the meeting; indeed, there&#39;s some things here that we didn&#39;t talk about at the meeting that I discovered later. But here goes anyway.</p>
<p>1. How does Bitcoin work? I&#39;m looking at the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it" target="_self">Khan Academy series on Bitcoin</a> and listened to one lecture which seems to spell it out quite well. I don&#39;t claim to know enough to describe the cryptographic ins and out here.</p>
<p>2. What can you do with Bitcoin? First, you can mine for new Bitcoins; that&#39;s popular, either with GPU-based mining tools or FPGAs or other specialized hardware (this <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison" target="_self">mining hardware comparison</a> is useful). Second, you can use Bitcoin to purchase goods and services, and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/05/09/25-things-i-learned-about-bitcoin-from-living-on-it-for-a-week/" target="_self">this Forbes reporter&#39;s account on living on Bitcoin for a week</a> is entertaining for a variety of reasons. Third, you can speculate in Bitcoin, hoping to buy low and sell high. Finally, you can build software and systems that help people do all of the above.</p>
<p>3. What are the risks of Bitcoin? First and foremost among those building software and systems, the problem is uncertainty of regulations, especially dealing with money laundering and financial crimes rules. The recent document &quot;<a href="http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html" target="_self">Application of FinCEN&#39;s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies</a>&quot; from March 2013 will need to be studied and pondered by everyone involved. The Washington Post (among many others) <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-15/business/39274717_1_money-laundering-monetary-policy-currency" target="_self">reported on Mt. Gox&#39;s troubles with FinCEN</a> and the seizure of funds from their account. There are also technical hurdles, such as the vulnerability of exchanges to denial of service attacks and the recent wild fluctuations in Bitcoin exchange rates.</p>
<p>4. How is this different from other virtual currencies? (I&#39;m thinking now Beenz, Flooz, Linden Dollars, Cybercash, Digicash, and the like.) See US News &quot;<a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/6-virtual-currencies-that-went-bust" target="_self">Six virtual currencies that went bust</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>5. Where is the action? In Ann Arbor, there&#39;s a startup exchange <a href="https://bitbox.mx/" target="_self">Bitbox</a>. In Berlin, there&#39;s the Kreuzberg district, with shops that accept Bitcoin (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/26/bitcoins-gain-currency-in-berlin" target="_self">so says the Guardian</a>). The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-blY0Gv3o" target="_self">Winkelvoss twins</a> are in on the business. San Jose was the home of the conference <a href="http://www.bitcoin2013.com/" target="_self">Bitcoin 2013</a>. Things are hopping all over the world.</p>
<p>6. Bitcoin is too mainstream, where can I go for more experimental moneys? Try <a href="http://junkcoin.org/" target="_self">JunkCoin</a>, which puts an element of randomness into mining, or <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_self">Ripple</a>, the &quot;world&#39;s first open payment network&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not really a summary of the meeting, but it&#39;s a summary of the things that I didn&#39;t know before that I now know a bit(coin) better.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a few sources for recipes that are similar to what you get at Sweetwaters when you order a Ginger-Lemon Tea (one of my favorites).</p>
<p>From Coppertop Kitchen (a blog by someone who was a Sweetwaters barista): <a href="http://coppertopkitchen.blogspot.com/2012/01/ginger-lemon-tea.html" target="_self">Ginger Lemon Tea</a></p>
<blockquote>2 cups fresh lemon juice<br />1 3- by 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and sliced thinly<br />10 cups water<br />1 cup honey<br /><br />Place lemon juice, ginger, and water in a large saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil.&#0160; Boil for a couple of minutes, cover and remove from heat, and steep at least 30 minutes.</blockquote>
<p>From Food Network, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/lemon-ginger-tea-recipe/index.html?oc=linkback" target="_self">Lemon Ginger Tea</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 quart water<br />Juice of 1 lemon<br />1/4 cup freshly grated ginger<br />1/4 cup honey<br />Thin slices of lemon and lime for garnish</p>
<p>In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add lemon juice, the squeezed lemon, and ginger. Let steep about 20 minutes. Stir in honey. Line a strainer with a thin wet cloth and strain tea into a pitcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From The Ginger People&#39;s <a href="http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs087/1101564793691/archive/1102619855670.html" target="_self">newsletter</a>, writing about Sweetwaters:</p>
<blockquote>They initially juiced their own ginger for the Ginger Lemon Tea but its increasing popularity eventually caused them to look for a commercially available ginger ingredient. After considering several options, they decided on The Ginger People&#39;s ginger juice because of its high quality and intensely true ginger flavor. Their secret recipe, which now includes our ginger juice, is served either hot or cold, and is one of their top selling drinks.</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, the secret ingredient - you&#39;ll have to <a href="http://gingerpeople.com/ingredients" target="_self">buy it in industrial quantities</a>, or juice your own.</p>

Here&#39;s some first estimates of picking times, based on email or postings from local U-Pick strawberry farms.</p>
<p>Rawsonville: <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/" target="_self">Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm</a> has an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rowesproduce.farm" target="_self">active Facebook page</a>, and doesn&#39;t yet have details of when first harvest will be. Their strawberries survived earlier frost scares. No U-Pick raspberries this year. &#0160;UPDATE: Rowe&#39;s will open for the season on June 8, berries&#0160;$1.78 per pound.</p>
<p>Ida: <a href="http://www.whittakersberryfarm.com" target="_self">Whittaker&#39;s Berry Farm</a> (also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WhittakersFarm" target="_self">Facebook</a>) is estimating first picking to start between June 10 and June 15, and notes that an average season is 18 days long. UPDATE: Whittaker&#39;s will open for the season on June 8. The price&#0160;is $1.42/lb.</p>
<p>Gregory: <a href="http://www.degrootsstrawberries.com/" target="_self">Degroot&#39;s Strawberries</a>&#0160;(also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/DeGroots-Strawberry-Farm/111222488898895" target="_self">Facebook</a>) predicts an opening day the second week of June.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll update this post as the season gets closer.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Credit to Salon&#39;s Andrew Leonard for the article &quot;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/05/17/revenge_ego_and_the_corruption_of_wikipedia/" target="_self">Revenge, ego, and the corruption of Wikipedia</a>&quot;, which unmasks wiki-troll Qworty and his pattern of anonymous mean-spirited edits to settle old grudges. Qworty - his real name is not important to my discussion of him - was a prolific Wikipedian. He routinely sabotaged the biographies of rival writers by doing things like removing lists of literary prizes they had won after they had died. Because Qworty generally played within the rules of the Wikipedia game, even his most egregious efforts had their defenders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/opinion/sunday/wikipedias-sexism-toward-female-novelists.html?_r=0" target="_self">the Filipacchi episode</a>, Qworty did not lack for defenders. Qworty, like many other Wikipedia editors, took seriously his responsibility to root out what he considered self promotion,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Peacock">unjustifiable praise</a>&#0160;or outright&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Puffery">puffery.</a>&#0160;Just the facts, ma’am! He described himself,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Qworty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=552532243">on his own Wikipedia user page,</a>&#0160;as particularly focused on identifying and fixing “articles with potential conflicts of interest.” Wherever he found people manipulating Wikipedia to their own advantage, he would intervene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Leonard caught wind of Qworty&#39;s excesses and decided to investigate further. What he found led to a remarkable revelation: Qworty was playing a game with Wikipedia, a game different from that of neutral points of view and building the knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Qworty&#39;s user page has been blanked, but thanks to Wikipedia&#39;s infinite memory, it lives on in past revisions. Before the page was shut down, it was replaced by a &#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Qworty&amp;oldid=556021296" target="_self">postmodernist manifesto</a> of sorts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you ask “Who is Qworty?” be aware of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_fallacy" title="Affective fallacy">affective fallacy</a>&#0160;and the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy" title="Intentional fallacy">intentional fallacy</a>. Be aware that not everybody has reacted to my words in the way that you do (because not everybody is like you), and be aware that anybody who is trying to guess my intentions as a writer is blowing the purest gas.</p>
<p>So who is Qworty? Qworty is one of the creators of text on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And what is Wikipedia? Wikipedia is the great postmodern novel, the book that&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>&#0160;might have written if he had lived long enough and could somehow convert himself into the finite number of monkeys who are writing this postmodern novel that is subtitled “the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.”</p>
<p>Wikipedia is pretty busy telling you what it is not—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>—so the question must be engaged, just what&#0160;<em>is</em>&#0160;Wikipedia, besides a poorly understood post-modern novel in perpetual progress?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The postmodern encyclopedia does not like being described as such, and Qworty (after some thrashing about) has been banned from Wikipedia.</p>

      <p>Yahoo is in talks to acquire Tumblr, with a price tag north of a billion dollars. Who knew that simplifying the blogging interface could be so profitable? I wonder, though, how Yahoo is going to make money off of Tumblr page views without ruining the service. (cf Flickr) (cf <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/10/google-analytics-real-time-vs-mybloglog.html" target="_self">MyBlogLog</a>) (cf GeoCities) etc. &#0160;<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/yahoo" target="_self">See what Tumblr users think of the acquisition</a>.</p>

<p>Yeah, so where is everyone heading now that Yahoo bought this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s nothing like a big messy purple smooch from Yahoo to make users fear for their accumulated friendships on a service that just wants to monetize page views with ads.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-15-internet-2020/">Internet 2020</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Some predictions for what the internet will look like in 2020, covering trends in mobile, laptop, social media like Facebook and Twitter, low-cost computer hardware, high speed networks and corporate evolution. Prepared for the LA2M marketing lunch meeting, 14 May 2013.</p>
<p>1. Mobile. See how far we&#39;ve come in a few short years (Wikipedia):</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d-pi"><img alt="Mobile_phone_evolution" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb197e63970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mobile_phone_evolution" /></a><br />We have a steady stream of innovations for better phones in the same size. Then what happens? The glass rectangle takes over, the keyboard disappears, and the screens start to get bigger. Behold the <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/opinion/mobile-phone/3426134/will-you-buy-phablet-this-year/" target="_self">phablet</a>:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d-pi"><img alt="Pcadvisor-phablet-Jim_on_large_phone" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb198dd3970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Pcadvisor-phablet-Jim_on_large_phone" /></a></p>
<p>What next? A few predictions. Mobile devices get more and more important as Internet devices; the sensible person who is developing a new web site should think first about how it looks on mobile. Devices themselves keep mutating - smaller, bigger, fancier, cheaper - and the rapid purchase cycle on mobile phones ensure that enough people have the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>This is my biggest prediction about the internet of 2020 - for more and more people, the mobile device will be their primary device, and all of the systems that depend on a big screen and a full keyboard will face pressure from the small screen.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Laptops</p>
<p>Back in 1981 - and really, that wasn&#39;t that long ago - the closest thing to laptops looked like this, the luggable 23.5 pound Osborne 1. (Image: Wikipedia)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d-pi"><img alt="Osborne_1_open" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1de3ac970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Osborne_1_open" /></a></p>
<p>Thirty-some years later, we&#39;re twenty pounds lighter, with a better keyboard, better screen, six orders of magnitude more memory, and built in high speed communications. (Image: Apple)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b-pi"><img alt="Macbook-air-overview_gallery_everyday" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c207f3c970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Macbook-air-overview_gallery_everyday" /></a></p>
<p>What&#39;s left to improve? The only thing left to remove from the weight of the device is to remove the keyboard entirely. Alas, that suggests to me that laptops start to enter a stage of stagnation, where you can&#39;t rely on rapid technological turnover to drive sales, and people keep their devices for three, four, five, six years since they have something that&#39;s perfectly good. That leaves the consumer with free cash to spend on mobile devices (see #1) and time to spend on smaller devices.</p>
<p><br />3. Facebook</p>
<p>Remember the ubiquitous America Online CDs? (Photo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dainbinder/" target="_self">Dain Binder</a>)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b-pi"><img alt="Aol-cds-flickr-dain-binder" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c4a8e970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Aol-cds-flickr-dain-binder" /></a><br />I really don&#39;t see how Facebook wins in the long run, to the extent that it&#39;s just like America Online. At some point something new comes along and the kids go there and the old service is just for old people. Old people are inconvenient - they aren&#39;t as much fun to advertise to, they tend to do inconvenient things like get sick and die, and do you really want your Facebook feed to look like an obituary feed?</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c5e6e970b-pi"><img alt="Creamglobal-facebook-tombstone" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c5e6e970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c1c5e6e970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Creamglobal-facebook-tombstone" /></a><br />Do I believe that Facebook will be dead? No. I think it will be less important and heading the way that all closed systems are heading, where the people who are there like it but few new people are joining and key demographics head for greener pastures. They are going to try to move the full-sized, rich, immersive Facebook environment (designed for laptop-sized screens), but the experience of Facebook Home (two star rating in the Google store, and ATT pulling the Facebook Home phone from sale) is that they will have trouble adapting to a mostly-mobile world.</p>

<p>3. Twitter</p>

<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb19df23970d-pi"><img alt="Postal_Telegraph_Messengers._(Indiana_has_no_age_limit_for_messengers.)_Indianapolis,_Ind._-_NARA_-_523084" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb19df23970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb19df23970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Postal_Telegraph_Messengers._(Indiana_has_no_age_limit_for_messengers.)_Indianapolis,_Ind._-_NARA_-_523084" /></a><br />Telegraphy has a fascinating history, with the use of codebooks to make long messages shorter, secrets sent by telegraph over open wires with the use of cryptography, and a long and slow process of moving telegrams from a labor-intensive human encoding and decoding process to highly automated electromechanical machinery for moving messages around.</p>
<p>The next step in short messaging services was SMS, which moved the power of the telegraphic communication from the telegraph network to the mobile phone network.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b-pi"><img alt="Mashable-autocorrect-19_32_00_157_file" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20a739970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Mashable-autocorrect-19_32_00_157_file" /></a><br />In that context, how do you view Twitter? Unlike Facebook, which ties individual accounts to individual people and attempts to shape the entirety of the user experience in posting and receiving, Twitter is a relatively more flexible system which allows not just people to post but also has a place for robots and automated machinery to post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make the bold assertion that short status updates are a better place to build a future world of Internet computing than all-encompassing immersive friend-driven environments.</p>
<p>5. Tiny computers and the internet of everything</p>
<p>Here&#39;s why I think the short message is the foundation of future computing.</p>
<p>Once upon a time if you wanted to do home automation - let&#39;s say, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/03/magazine/fast-forward-really-remote-control.html" target="_self">hooking up a temperature probe to your hot tub</a>, so that you coudl be sure that it didn&#39;t freeze in the Michigan winter if your tub heater conked out - you&#39;d set up something like this (a Sun 3/60, photo Wikipedia). It was about $5000 worth of gear used, and if you were the first person to do this (like Paul Haas of Ypsilanti) Esquire Magazine would get word of it and note &#39;Paul&#39;s kind of geeky&#39;.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c-pi"><img alt="Sun3_60_Disk_Tape" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01910216c2b9970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Sun3_60_Disk_Tape" /></a><br />Now days, small programmable internet devices are cheap. There&#39;s the bare bones CPU of the Raspberry Pi, easily comparable in power to the $5000 Sun, for $35 (Photo: CNET)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b-pi"><img alt="Cnet-Raspberry_Pi_35332544_05_1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901c20c018970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Cnet-Raspberry_Pi_35332544_05_1" /></a><br />and shiny consumer devices like the Nest thermostat take the power of small controllers to the next step of plug-in readiness:</p>

<p>7. Death of the net</p>
<p>&#0160;Finally, it&#39;s worth remembering what has disappeared from the network (and why) to have some sober expectations for the much-beloved services of today that are going to strike out.</p>
<p>Image: <a href="http://www.googleappsforedu.com/google-reader-alternative/" target="_self">GoogleAppsForEdu</a></p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c-pi"><img alt="Googleappsforedu-google-reader" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019102182b0c970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Googleappsforedu-google-reader" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>One reason that services close is that the organization that runs them no longer has the appetite for them. Google has killed a number of services that it has acquired after pulling from them the good ideas and the people resources that attracted them to it in the first place.</p>
<p>Sometimes services die because there&#39;s better ones available - see the Internet Gopher, which peaked in 1993, 20 years ago, when it was bigger than the World Wide Web. (Image: Brad W. James)</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d-pi"><img alt="Bwjames-gopher" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1f9a98970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bwjames-gopher" /></a><br />The death of Gopher is either the result of technological determinism (Web pages were prettier) or the result of poor management (U of Minnesota was looking for licensing fees). In either case, what did happen was that a system that many people used disappeared from public view in a few short years</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d-pi"><img alt="Screen shot 2013-05-13 at 3.30.58 PM" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb1ff6ef970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen shot 2013-05-13 at 3.30.58 PM" /></a><br />The Internet turns out to be a cyclical industry, with periods of manic growth interspersed with deep depressions. The dot-com flameout, as expressed in Phil Kaplan&#39;s &quot;F&#39;d Companies&quot;, chronicled the demise of dozens of well-funded but poorly thought out new companies of the dot-com era.</p>
<p>If we look forward far enough in time, it&#39;s almost certain that the Internet will go through some sort of corrective cycle, with startup companies dying faster than they are born. They will run out of money, or some part of the ecosystem that sustains them will fall apart just long enough to wipe them out, or their founders will get hired away by some megacorp and their project/product abandoned in the process.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager.html" target="_self">I wrote an early review of Contactually</a>, and I signed up for their pro service after the trial period expired. I used the system for a couple of months, but have decided to back down from the pro version back to the free version for a while. Here are some reasons for that.</p>

<p>First and perhaps foremost, Contactually is relatively expensive at $20/mo. I looked at what I was spending (or not spending) on other internet services that I use and like. I don&#39;t have a Flickr Pro account, but I used to, and I could get a year of service for less than two months of Contactually. Similarly I could renew another year of Pinboard pro service for less than two months of Contactually. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s expensive in absolute terms, but relative to other things I want to spend money on online, it looks spendy.</p>

<p>Second - and this is as much of a criticism of my habits than of Contactually - I never really managed to get it to systematically unearth new people to contact that had fallen off my radar. Rather than provide an ever-changing set of new folks to prod me to reconnect with, it seemed to recommend the same people over and over. That was useful at first to be mindful of people a second time if I had passed them by the first time, but the net result was that there were fewer people than I expected that Contactually re-introduced me to.</p>

<p>I have an Android phone, and Contactually doesn&#39;t yet have an Android app. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a deal breaker, but I&#39;m hoping that they come out with something that&#39;s awesome - and I&#39;m willing to re-up for pro service again in order to try it out if that&#39;s what it takes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still unhappy overall with the state of Android contact managers. I would have thought that everyone ever designing a contact manager would have an updatable field for &quot;last contact date&quot; that had some kind of easy to view screens to see how you&#39;re doing, and that would be smart about noticing phone calls, emails, text messages, and meetings from your calendar. Hey, you could do that even on paper rolodex cards! Contact management basics need to be better across the board so that your phone can prompt you on who to call next, a sort of predictive dialer for your life.</p>

Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age?</p>
<p>One approach is the &quot;virtual bookplate&quot;, described in <a href="http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/419.full" target="_self">this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida</a>. The catalog is extended to include graphics that honor the donor of the materials, and the search is extended to make it easy to look up all of the works that were donated by a particular individual. The story goes that a donor was so impressed at how easy it was to see a pretty view of what they had given to the library that they wrote a check on the spot to donate more.</p>
<p>Another perspective on this is the &quot;virtual collection of bookplates&quot;. The one of these that I&#39;ve found is the&#0160;<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/exlibris/" target="_self">John Starr Stewart Ex Libris Collection</a>&#0160;at the University of Illinois, with over 1500 plates collected between 1903 and 1906.

<blockquote>“Learning about Internet culture is like learning a new language. Immersion is the most important approach – but immersion in cyberspace has its seductive side. There is always something new: there are new developments related to the Internet, whether technological, social, cultural, or political. Studying the Internet did indeed feel like shooting a moving target. …<strong>To be sure, the Internet changes daily.</strong> But that does not mean what happened yesterday is meaningless today, for every little development in the past becomes part of the present. …Seen in this way, no research of the Internet can be outdated.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, it&#39;s apparent that search and social infrastructure (Google and Twitter) now play a key role in re-spawning content that gets blocked in any one place, and drawing even more attention to the surviving copies. If suppressed content automatically goes viral, the Internet&#39;s construction basically guarantees that that content will have a home for the rest of time. If you attack DNS support, people will tweet raw IP addresses. If you take down the BGP routes to web content, people will put up more mirrors, or switch to overlay networks to distribute the data.
