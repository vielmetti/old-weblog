      </h3>
      I stumbled into a world of "parking advocacy organizations" (trade associations for parking structure operators) and this video about how a garage in California is using per-space lights and sensors to speed up the process of people finding parking in a structure that's mostly full.<br><br>The parking rhetoric in Ann Arbor is that a structure is full if it's at 85% capacity, based on one consultant's recommendations.&nbsp; I'd like to challenge that and say that no one really cares how full a garage is if you know that you won't be frustrated finding a space.<br><br>

<blockquote>
Statistics show that 10% to 15% of the parking spaces in garages are not used, even when the garage appears full. In a parking structure such as Century City with 2,500 spaces, that means that at any given time, the garage could “appear” full, but it would have 200 to 400 spaces available. “You just couldn’t find them, at least not easily,” deWildt says. “It’s like we had built a 400-space garage.”

      </h3>
      <p>Paul Harvey passed away today at the age of 90.</p>
<p>Rich Hall played him on Saturday Night Live - a clip I can't find right now - and also in this 1987 Showtime special I found on Youtube.

<p>
<a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1882444,00.html">Time Magazine's obituary talks a bit about the Rich Hall piece on SNL:</a>
</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
A salesman for himself and his vision of the American dream, he was also a master peddler of many products, whose makers were as loyal to Harvey as his listeners. A skit from the 1984-85 season of Saturday Night Live had Harvey (played by Rich Hall) compulsively peppering his news items with sponsor names. The man remained unapologetic. "Some days," he told Larry King in 1988, "the best news in the broadcast is the commercial. You can keep your natural teeth all your natural life! There is a glove that doesn't wear out! There is a car battery that keeps its promises! That's good news! And I would use those things on the air if they were not in the body of the commercial." The finest huckster is the one who's sold himself on the product first.<br></div><p><br>I'll keep looking.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor Merchants affected by this are asked to contact Chamber president Jesse Bernstein for assistance.
</p>
<p>
CertifiChecks is based in Dayton, Ohio; here&#39;s what the <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/business/2009/02/27/ddn022709certifichecksweb.html">news report from writer Ben Sutherly in Dayton</a> says:
</p><blockquote><p>
The company said it has halted gift certificate sales and its administration of gift certificate programs, effective Thursday, Feb. 26.

The company said it is filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in federal court in Dayton.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A 2002 story in the <a href="http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2002/07/08/daily26.html">Dayton Business Journal</a> gives some sense for their scope of operations:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded in 1999 by Steve Buchholz, serves nearly 40,000 associations, chambers of commerce and mall or shopping centers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
By 2004, when Certifichecks had signed up a network of Christian-owned hotels, they had grown substantially, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2004/10/25/daily5.html">as noted in the Dayton Business Journal</a>:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded locally by Steve Buchholz in 1999, now has about 72,000 restaurant associations, chambers of commerce and bed and breakfast associations as customers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
News is starting to trickle in about the impact of this. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/02/chamber_fumes_as_widespread_gi.html">From Muskegon, MI, Chad Lerch of the Muskegon Chronicle writes in the story Muskegon Chamber fumes as widespread CertifiChecks gift checks bounce</a>


</p><blockquote><p>
MUSKEGON COUNTY -- An Ohio-based company that offers gift checks for retailers abruptly closed Thursday, leaving West Michigan chambers of commerce, merchants and shoppers fuming and searching for answers.


Cindy Larsen, president of the Muskegon Area Chamber of Commerce, said up to $150,000 worth of gift checks for &quot;Muskegon Money&quot; could still be unspent.

If that&#39;s the case, a myriad of shoppers are holding checks that are worthless -- at least for now.

&quot;We&#39;re freaking out,&quot; Larsen said. &quot;We&#39;re freaking out because we&#39;re worried that someone is going to get stuck.&quot;
</p></blockquote><p>More will certainly come out of this story - if Certifichecks really has this many subscribers, gift cards and gift certificates are going to start bouncing all over the country.</p>

&#0160;Use them. &#0160;Everyone&#39;s attention span is short, and lists let people know just how far along they are before they can be done. &#0160;They let you jump from idea to idea without pesky transitions, and make it easy for someone else to cut and paste that one good idea hiding in your pile of dreck and take it for their own.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>7. &#0160;Quote liberally (and credit liberally). &#0160;Half the battle in blogging is figuring out who knows more than you do about something; the other half the battle is figuring out who is uselessly ignorant but still writes a lot. &#0160;If you are good and thorough and relentless in clipping out good paragraphs from other people&#39;s work, and you are good and thorough and relentless in doing the searches that end up in results that aren&#39;t on everyone else&#39;s front page of Google, you can learn a lot and share a lot.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>I&#39;ve been averaging a post a day for a long time. &#0160;Some days more, some days less, and some blogs are mercifully left for dead from ideas that didn&#39;t pan out. &#0160;I wish I knew what it all meant. &#0160;In some ways it reminds me a lot of my short lived but illustrious high school forensics career of impromptu speaking - all it really shows is that you can be coherent on short notice about pretty much anything, and that you have enough diligence to keep being coherent for a long time.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>If someone can tell me what career that qualifies me for, please let me know - I&#39;m looking.</span></div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A new breed of general-purpose manycore computing platform is
emerging. Exemplary examples include the Niagara from Sun Microsystems,
the G80 from Nvidia, the Cell from IBM, and the up-coming Larrabee from
Intel. These manycore processors each pack 8-32 relatively simple cores
on a chip, capable of supporting up to 100s of threads, and boast
tremendous potential peak single-chip performances up to the range of
Tera-FLOPS. However, traditional algorithms and applications in many
domains cannot take advantage of much of the parallelism provided by
these platforms. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The ParLab at Berkeley was recently founded in part to help
meet this acute need for novel algorithmic approaches to unleash the
performance potentials of emerging manycore platforms for a wide range
of application domains. It proposes to concentrate on analyzing the
communication and computation patterns (or Dwarfs) of important classes
of algorithms underlying modern application domains, and develop
techniques to efficiently parallelize them for the general purpose
manycore platforms.
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">We concentrate on the domain of image recognition and

develop parallelization techniques to improve the performance of these

although cocr is by no means a complete ocr package it is orders of

<p><em>We are writing to inform you of the recent investigation and
analysis that was performed on the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S.
State Street.&#0160; We are also reporting on the condition of the bridge and
providing information regarding possible short- and long-term solutions
for the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street and the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>Attached, please find a Traffic Control Order (TCO) that
recommends a reduction in allowable gross vehicle weights for the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street in accordance with the
limits contained in this memorandum.</em></p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>On December 29, 2007, our Field Operations forces were called
out to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street as
medium-sized pieces of concrete were falling off of the bottom of one
of the box beams that support the roadway.&#0160; These pieces of concrete
were large enough to damage passing vehicles, if they were to strike
them.&#0160; Our Field Operations and Safety Services personnel closed one
lane of traffic at a time and removed the remaining loose concrete from
the underside of the box beam.&#0160; No injuries due to the falling concrete
were reported.</em></p>
<p><em>As a result of the concrete removal, we reviewed the structure
again and were concerned about the condition of one of the box beams.&#0160;
In early January 2008, a meeting was held on-site between Project
Management Unit, our bridge inspection consultant, and bridge design
personnel to review the condition of the bridge and (1) determine what
possible courses of action could be taken to help prevent further
damage to the bridge and (2) identify possible repair strategies.</em></p>
<p><em>We directed our consultants to re-analyze the bridge structure
given the section loss that had just occurred.&#0160; As you may recall,
effective January 1, 2008 we lowered the weight limits due to section
loss that was discovered during the biennial inspection that was
performed in late October 2007.&#0160; Based upon the new analysis that was
performed in January 2008, it is recommended that we reduce the weight
limits on this structure again.<br />
Condition of the bridge</em></p>
<p><em>The existing bridge is composed of 16 pre-stressed concrete box
beams that are laid side-by-side.&#0160; They are “tied” together with steel
post-tensioning rods that connect pairs of beams together.&#0160; The beams
are overlaid with an asphalt wearing surface.&#0160; There is a concrete
sidewalk that has been cast on top of the two northernmost beams.&#0160; The
bridge does not provide sufficient vertical or horizontal clearances
and is considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the box beams has developed a severe longitudinal crack.&#0160;
This is the beam that our field personnel had to hand-chip to remove
the spalled concrete in late December 2007.&#0160; There are other beams that
are developing longitudinal cracks, as well.&#0160; Other beams have several
broken pre-stressing strands and the abutments that support the beams
are in poor condition.&#0160; Note that the pre-stressing strands are the
primary elements of the bridge beams that provide structural strength.&#0160;
Based on these deficiencies, the bridge, viewed as a whole, is
considered to be in poor condition.&#0160; The beam that is severely cracked
is considered to be in serious condition.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon review of the “as-built” drawings of the structure, we
believe that it is not possible to repair the severely cracked beam in
any manner that can restore its structural integrity.&#0160; This is due to
the location of the beam itself, and the location and configuration of
the post-tensioning rods that tie the box beams together.&#0160; The severely
cracked beam is the fifth beam in from the south side of the
structure.&#0160; Due to the manner in which the bridge was constructed, it
is not possible to replace only this beam. In order to repair the beam,
we would have to cut the post tensioning rods on each side of the
beam.&#0160; We would not be able to access the needed areas of the beams to
re-install the post-tensioning rods, however, effectively leaving the
beams to function individually.&#0160; This would be unacceptable.&#0160; There is
also one other beam that contains small cracks that currently are not
as severe as the beam described above, but we believe that it is likely
that it, too, will crack in a similar manner.&#0160; AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE
IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST FIVE BEAMS ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THE BRIDGE, AND POSSIBLY AS MANY AS EIGHT.</em></p>
<p><em>Exacerbating the problem is the condition of the remaining
beams.&#0160; We believe that it is likely that the tops of these beams have
begun to spall.&#0160; It is apparent to us that salt-laden water has seeped
between the asphalt layer covering the beams and the beams themselves.&#0160;
Water routinely leaks around the beams and runs down the abutment
walls.&#0160; Over time, this moisture and salt will cause the concrete to
disintegrate.&#0160; Given the length of time this has been occurring, we
have reason to believe that it is possible that the tops of the beams
are damaged to the point that they may not be able to be repaired, if
we were to attempt it.</em></p>
<p><em>We also believe that any attempt at performing a repair itself
would be expensive.&#0160; We do not have detailed costs at this time, but we
estimate that it would cost at least $250,000 to attempt to replace the
five to eight south side bridge beams.&#0160; Also, it would take at least
one month to perform the needed construction.</em></p>
<p><em>At your request, we could prepare a more thorough and detailed
estimate of the repair costs and other possible options that could be
implemented should funding for the replacement of the structure not be
available in the foreseeable future.&#0160; This evaluation would cost
approximately $15,000 to retain the services of a structural engineer
to analyze and review various options.&#0160; We also recommend that about
$10,000 be budgeted for our Field Services personnel to assist in the
performance forensic investigations on the bridge in order to better
determine the extent of deterioration of the existing bridge beams and
abutments.</em></p>
<p><em>We do not believe that it is possible to repair the bridge over
S. State Street cost effectively, however.&#0160; This is due to the
extensive deterioration of the existing beams, abutments, and
asphalt-wearing surface.&#0160; As mentioned previously, the bridge is
considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.&#0160; These
deficiencies cannot be easily remedied.&#0160; We will, of course, continue
to monitor the condition of the bridge. Should it become necessary, we
are prepared to repair the structure in order to allow the bridge to
remain in service.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Short-term Action</em></p>
<p><em>In order to help minimize damage to this structure and prolong
its life span to the greatest extent possible, we are recommending that
the weight limits be lowered.&#0160; We have prepared the following table
that compares the existing and proposed weight limits for the three
classes of trucks that can use the structure:</em></p>

Load carrying capacity<br />
Single Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 31 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 19 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Two-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 24 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Three-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 44 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 26 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 41%</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed Traffic Control Order (TCO) recommends a reduction
in gross vehicle weight for the three types of trucks that can travel
on Michigan roadways without special permits.&#0160; They are one, two, and
three-unit trucks.&#0160; A single-unit truck is any truck without a
trailer.&#0160; A single-unit truck can be any number of common vehicles.&#0160;
Some examples of this would be a school or AATA bus, moving van, or in
the worst case, a fully loaded concrete truck.&#0160; A two-unit truck can be
most easily described as a semi-truck with one trailer.&#0160; Note, a
pick-up truck or car pulling an “ordinary” trailer (such as the
trailers that lawn maintenance companies would use) would not be
considered a two-unit vehicle. Finally, a three-unit truck can be most
easily thought of as a semi-truck pulling two trailers.&#0160; An example of
this would be the large sand or gravel hauling trucks that bring
materials to construction sites.</em></p>
<p><em>The recommended gross vehicle weight reductions are
significant.&#0160; Also, the overall condition of the bridge has declined
measurably over the course of the last calendar year.&#0160; We expect that
the condition of the structure will continue to decline as the
structure is nearing the end of its useful life.&#0160; Based on the rate of
deterioration that we have observed over the course of the last few
years, we believe that the structure has approximately three to five
years in which it will be able to carry trucks.&#0160; We also expect that
additional weight limit restrictions will be necessary in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Long-term Actions</em></p>
<p><em>As you may recall, we have begun a project to perform the
preliminary design of the replacement for this structure, as well as
the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.&#0160;
The bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks is located about 300 feet
to the west of the bridge over S. State Street.&#0160; We believe it makes
sense to consider replacing both bridges at the same time, although it
is also possible to replace the two bridge structures at different
times.</em></p>
<p><em>We have not able to move forward on the preliminary design of
the bridge over S. State Street or the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks
because we are waiting for the 4th Ward City Council members to
nominate and confirm a Citizens Advisory Committee to assist us with
the public engagement process.&#0160; It has been our experience with
projects of this nature that it is important to consider and review all
aspects of the proposed design with the citizens in order to make sure
the project that we deliver meets community expectations.&#0160; This process
will also help us to avoid conflicts later in the design process as we
will have already confirmed the design approach and aesthetics of the
project with the public and City Council.&#0160; Finally, this preliminary
design process will allow us to better estimate the cost of the project
based on a more complete picture of all project elements.</em></p>
<p><em>We have estimated that it will take about 2 to 3 years to
prepare for bridge replacement including the public engagement and
internal project review process; the preliminary and final design of
the bridges and needed approach work; and the development of a funding
plan for the project.&#0160; We have prepared a tentative schedule for this
project such that its construction could be started shortly after the
University of Michigan’s Football Stadium Renovations are completed.&#0160;
We are also planning and coordinating this project so that it is
compatible with the planned improvements along W. Stadium Boulevard.&#0160;
Attached, please find a drawing that we have prepared that locates all
of these planned improvements and their anticipated starting and
completion dates.&#0160; Also attached, please find the tentative project
schedule that details the required tasks and estimated durations of the
required activities to complete the project’s design.</em></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p><em>Fortunately, the reduction in weights that we are proposing does
not yet affect most of the everyday users of this structure.&#0160; However,
we believe that when it is again necessary to reduce the posted weight
limits, both AATA and the Ann Arbor Public Schools will be impacted by
this change.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed change will impact the trucking and construction
operations that use this corridor as they, most probably, will not be
able to route trucks through this portion of the E. Stadium Boulevard
corridor between S. Industrial Highway and S. Main Street.&#0160; These types
of trucks will have to find an alternative route around this portion of
E. Stadium Boulevard.</em></p>
<p><em>We are also working with the Communications Office to prepare a
press release notifying the appropriate agencies of the proposed change.</em></p>

      <p>This bit of an exchange from a mailing list has been stuck in my inbox for more than a year, time to post it.&#0160; It was about <a href="http://chi.mp/">Chi.mp</a>, a &quot;content hub and identity management portal&quot;.</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">People using Chi.mp will have identities that are importable, exportable, interoperable, portable and most importantly theirs. 


<br /></div><p><br />and I can&#39;t help but think of this from the magazine In Formation #2, part of the late dot-com era:

identities are not something that can be reduced
to microformats. I can change my mind, and not
have to go back and update a zillion web pages to
reflect that change of mind. Whatever you are
calling &quot;identity&quot; here is emphatically not what
human beings think of as their identity; perhaps
if you replaced it with &quot;dossier&quot; the nature of
the data gathering would be more clear in a historical
context (think Stasi, for instance, instead of Facebook).</p><p>To the extent that your personal data projected onto the internet
(or onto the financial networks or the astral plane) is a reflection of
you, then in some real sense it is you.
</p><p>I&#39;ll stay very skeptical that by standardizing a microformat that we
can easily update that we can somehow &quot;control our own identity&quot;.
How much of your personal identity (or the data that reflects some
aspect of your personal identity) is really stored on servers and systems
and for that matter on paper beyond your immediate control? After all,
I have a dossier (er, Address Book entry) which you can&#39;t update at
will. If you change names, change jobs, or change ideas about what
your Self is, that&#39;s going to take some time to percolate through The System,
and some parts of it will be unchangable just like the name you never
use now but that people who knew you from when you were little still
call you.</p>

      <p>Here&#39;s some notes about parallel computing, going in two directions at the same time.&#0160; In one direction you have tools like Map/Reduce or Hadoop managing the work of parceling a problem into many pieces and then coordinating the collection of those pieces.&#0160; In another direction you have graphics chips being turned into interesting general purpose parallel computing chips that can do some specific operations very fast.</p><p>It&#39;s mostly in the form of clippings, in part because I don&#39;t have a whole story yet, just the fragments.</p><p>from<a href="http://www.p16blog.com/p16/2008/07/supercomputing-for-the-masses-nvidia-cuda.html"> P16: Practical Progress - Supercomputing for the masses</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One thing CUDA doesn&#39;t provide is a way to manage and process
massive datasets. The cards have somewhat limited memory, and you have
to write an app that runs on the host and feeds the card with data. For
search applications like topic clustering -- which I&#39;d like to use this
for -- CUDA alone doesn&#39;t provide an answer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Perhaps it would make sense eventually to use Hadoop plus CUDA --
write your map/reduce tasks in CUDA, and rely on Hadoop to distribute
data around a cluster of Nvidia-accelerated boxes?</p><p>find23.net -<a href="http://find23.net/2008/12/11/map-reduce-on-gpus/"> Map Reduce on GPUs</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">A fellow at the german hadoop user meeting (Thanks to Isabel that
organized that again) pointed me to the fact that GPUs on a graphic

He mentioned there are some research papers in this field. I spend some
time to read through what I could found and it was quite interesting.
Let me citate some of the facts from the two most interesting papers:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">+ “A Map Reduce Framework for Programming Graphics Processors” by
Bryan Catanzaro, Narayanan Sundaram and Kurt Keutzer UC, Berkeley<br />
+ “Mars: A MapReduce Framework on Graphics Processors” by Bingsheng He, Wenbin Fang, Qiong Luo, Naga K. Govindaraju, Tuyong Wang</p><p>and, hiding at the end of a long set of searches, is <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a>, a company</p>
<p class="large" style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>Hadoop</span> is the popular open source
implementation of MapReduce, a powerful tool designed for the detailed
analysis and transformation of very large data sets. Hadoop enables you
to explore complex data in its native form, using custom analyses
tailored to the information and questions you have.</p>
<p class="large blue" style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>Cloudera</span> can help you install, configure and run Hadoop for large-scale data processing and analysis.</p><p>The vision is not a rack of ordinary CPUs using Hadoop to manage them; the vision is a rack of CPU+GPU combinations where you can take advantage of parallelization both between machines and on the machine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&#39;re concerned too.</p><p>The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.&#0160; Here&#39;s something like a narrative.</p><p>In the 1969, Jimmy Dean opened a sausage factory in Plainview, TX.&#0160; It closed in 1974, sat idle for 30 years, and then was reopened as a peanut processing plant in 2004.&#0160;&#0160; The best local source for news coverage is the <a href="http://www.myplainview.com/">Plainview Daily Herald</a>, and these clippings are from their online site.</p><p>From the Plainview Daily Herald, 4/15/2004:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jim Booher, who has been involved in food processing for 20 years, is working on opening his third plant and is highly complimentary of the cooperation he´s received here as manager of the Peanut Corporation of America plant. <br /><br />Renovation work is under way on the old Jimmy Dean Meat Co. plant on <br />the west service road of North I-27, adjacent to United Parcel Service. <br />The community landed PCA in December, offering an incentive package <br />which included $390,000 over 10 years with the Plainview-Hale County <br />Industrial Foundation, the City of Plainview and Hale County each <br />putting up $13,000 a year. In-kind work by each entity will be done as <br />well. The package does not include tax abatement. <br /><br />High Plains Millwright of Plainview is handling the demolition work, <br />tearing down some walls, taking out concrete tiers and doing other <br />work before renovation begins. A metal building will be erected on an <br />existing concrete slab and will be connected to the main building. <br />“We hope to be open sometime in August or September, depending on <br />when we get our equipment installed,” said Booher, who is moving here <br />from Grand Prairie.<br /></div><p><br />KCBD, Ch. 11, has a similar story from 4/21/04:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Plainview Peanut Plant to Open this Summer <br />Peanut production in West Texas is growing and <br />that&#39;s why local farmers are excited about the <br />new plant. The plant is undergoing a facelift to <br />make way for 80,000 square feet of peanut <br />processing machinery. &quot;We&#39;re looking at <br />probably within the next three months of <br />putting equipment in and painting and getting <br />ready for operation,&quot; says plant manager, Jim <br />Booher. <br /></div><p><br />The cached copy of the PCA site (since removed) has this to say about the Texas plant:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re Ready NOW, not later! <br />Beginning with the first load of <br />peanuts ever processed at Peanut <br />Corporation&#39;s new Texas plant, our <br />most&#0160; important&#0160; task has been <br />quality.&#0160; We don&#39;t&#0160; request&#0160; your <br />patience while we figure out how to <br />do this. <br />Instead, we request that you hold us <br />to the high standards you&#39;ve always <br />expected from a Peanut Corporation <br />of America plant. We&#39;re ready.&#0160; <br />Pride in Our Newest Plant. Pride in Texas! <br />There couldn&#39;t be a more perfect location than Plainview, <br />Texas for the newest addition to Peanut Corporation&#39;s list of <br />plants! Just off North Interstate 27 in Plainview, we connect <br />the Western and Central&#0160; United States with the Texas <br />Peanut Industry. Texas really is the best state, y&#39;all! <br />&#0160;<br />Blanchers <br />Product Listing <br />Coming soon to this spot: a comprehensive <br />listing of products and services brought to <br />you by Peanut Corporation of America in <br />Plainview, Texas. <br />Until the list is posted, please feel free to <br />contact Jim Booher, our Texas plant&#39;s <br />operations manager for a complete discussion <br />of how we can serve you. <br /></div><p><br />How did Plainview get the plant?&#0160; More from the Daily Herald, Feb 25 2007:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One day,&#0160;Peanut Corporation of America President Stewart Parnell
from Lynchburg, Va., flew&#0160;in for fuel and a visit and happened to
mention that&#0160;he was looking to locate a peanut processing plant in this
area, and Miller directed him to Hale County State Bank President Brian
Pohlmeier, who&#0160;was on the board of the Plainview-Hale County&#0160;Industrial
Board.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">“As it turned out,” said Miller, “Brian had
been&#0160;Parnell’s&#0160;loan officer&#0160;for several of the planes he had bought and
it wound up with the peanut plant locating in the old Jimmy Dean plant.”</p><p>The Sept 1, 2008 Daily Herald has a brief story about the rehab of the plant:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The IDC has issued millions of dollars in revenue bonds to help
businesses in the area, including three bonds in Hale County and four
in Castro County — mainly for dairies, IDC legal representative Malcolm
Tisdel said.</span></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The city and county work hand-in-hand with the IDC and Plainview/Hale County Industrial Foundation to bring in new industry.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Jesus
Garrocho, operations manager at Peanut Corporation of America, said the
IDC was instrumental in bringing the company to Plainview.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>“The
(Peanut Corp.) facility had been empty for 30 years,” Brian Pohlmeier,
president of the IDC, said. “Now it has a business that employees
30-some people.”</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Together, the Industrial Foundation and IDC
have contributed substantial economic impact to the area. The IDC helps
not only Hale County but surrounding counties as well.</span></div><p><br />There&#39;s more from the 10/29/2003 Daily Herald:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The inducement package being offered Peanut Corp. calls for the
city, county and Plainview-Hale County Industrial Foundation to
contribute $100,000 each in $10,000 increments over a 10-year span. It
also calls for paving the parking lot of the plant and installing a
special water line for firefighting purposes.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The county approved the proposal Monday and the industrial foundation board was expected to do so today.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
In return for the incentives, the plant ­ which will process shelled
and cleaned peanuts into candy and food products ­ is expected to hire
an initial batch of 35 employees, process 256,000 pounds of nuts daily
and ultimately invest $1 million in the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> “If they pull
out, we don´t pay the ($10,000) installments,” industrial foundation
Executive Director Grady Elder said in outlining the proposal at
Monday´s Commissioners Court meeting.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The plant closed in 1974. The building is owned by Ronald Thompson of Lubbock. </p><p>I don&#39;t know what a sausage factory that has been idle for 30 years looks like, and how much it takes to rehab it to the point where it&#39;s ready to clean peanuts for use in candy.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.markforster.net/blog/">Mark Forster has a new productivity system which he calls Autofocus.&#0160;</a> There&#39;s the obligatory blog, video, twitter account, glowing Lifehacker review etc etc.&#0160; If you care, you&#39;ll look them up.</p><p>Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&#39;re working on.&#0160; Rather that giving tasks tags, categories, priorities, precedence, importance, geographic location, or anything else, you simply step through your list one page at a time.&#0160; To decide what to do next you contemplate all of the unsolved tasks on that page, and when one of them jumps out at you, you do it.</p><p>The page at a time approach ensures that you don&#39;t spend all your time in contemplation and that there&#39;s a finite and shrinking list of things to contemplate.&#0160; The lack of explicit sorting means that you can engage in constructive procrastination to do something that needs to be done without feeling bad that the thing that has to be done is delayed.&#0160; And the lack of tags etc. means that the cognitive overhead of keeping track of how you make a decision goes away - you just pick something and do it.</p><p>(One more piece of this that I haven&#39;t done yet is the algorithm for deciding what not to do; apparently if you look at a page and nothing jumps out at you, you are to cross off everything on the page and not do them.&#0160; And doing something partially is OK, you mark it off on the old page and re-enter it on the new page.)</p><p>I have a weakness for new systems, if only because learning a new system means that you apply a new filter to the same old things that have been postponed for too long and you get a new way to handle a burst of attention.&#0160; This one works well on paper and works with the reporter-style pocket notebook I&#39;m using.&#0160; </p><p>I&#39;ve used similar approaches before to exploring big problem sets - if you divide the whole set into small and manageable pieces, and do something useful with each of those pieces, then you can get through a lot without trying to optimize every decision.&#0160; It works, for instance, as the strategy for picking out some new books to read from a library new bookshelf, just go one shelf at a time and pick something that catches your eye from each shelf.&#0160; You can get through a lot that way - it won&#39;t be everything, and it won&#39;t be exhaustive, but the throughput in a system where lots of decisions are easy and lots of alternatives are exposed can be good.</p>

      <p>Ruth is writing about the Ann Arbor Public Schools in a new blog <a href="http://a2schoolsmuse.blogspot.com/">Ann Arbor Schools Musings. </a></p><p><a href="http://a2schoolsmuse.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-im-writing-about-schools.html">Her introductory post spells out the reasons for blogging about school:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes I find the schools satisfactory, and sometimes not, but in general I have a lot of questions. Questions about <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> things run the way they do. <span style="font-style: italic;">Questions</span> about whether things could run better. <span style="font-style: italic;">Critiques</span> about the schools. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ideas</span>
to improve them. And--in general--I believe that most of the staff
wants the schools to work. But for whom? Are we teaching to the masses?
To the top 10%? The bottom 10%? And are we succeeding? Anyway, what
does it mean to succeed?<br /><br />In addition, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ann Arbor News</span> shrinks its coverage of everything (except maybe sports--which are important too), <span style="font-weight: bold;">we are not getting the news we need about the schools</span>. I believe that <span style="font-weight: bold;">these are our schools</span>--yes,
the taxpayers--and we need to know what is going on. These are our
schools--yes, the parents--and we need to be able to make decisions for
our kids. These are our schools--yes, the staff--who often don&#39;t have a
voice in decisions. These are our schools--yes, the students--and what
students think also matters.<br /></div><p><br />The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/boe_home">Ann Arbor Public Schools are run by an elected Board of Education; their web site</a> has some information about how that public body operates.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.0809/home">board calendar</a> for 2008-2009 has a schedule of public meetings, and includes links to the packets of information that have been assembled for the board to review for each meeting.&#0160; You may find them dry reading; you may find them hard to get through; you might find them slow to download, because the one I picked up with 64 pages and 4.4 megabytes, mostly of newspaper clippings from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; If you have comments, there are <a href="http://www.aaps.k12.mi.us/boe.home/rules_for_public_commentary">rules for public commentary at the board meetings</a>, which appear to be well elaborated to deal with any number of issues that arise.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The days of quickly flashing your MCard to ride an Ann Arbor bus will soon be gone.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To cut down on the use of expired MCards, the Ann Arbor
Transportation Authority will require all pass holders, including
current yellow MCard holders, to swipe their cards through an updated
fare box on all fixed route buses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The change will take effect Feb. 16.</p><p>Note that any delays on boarding will affect on-time performance of routes that serve the University.&#0160; Some of those buses run very full at peak hours, and so you should watch for indicators of worse on-time performance for those routes when lots of U of Michigan passengers get on and off.</p><p>As a point of contrast, the U of Michigan buses don&#39;t require any ID or fares when boarding; their cost per bus-hour is in the $55/hr range, compared with AATA&#39;s $100/hr or so.&#0160; Those are not apples to apples comparisons, but certainly the faster you can board a bus full the less bus-hours you spend waiting at the curb and the more bus-hours you can spend getting from place to place.</p>

opinions on Kennecott's plans to re-open the old Humboldt Mill at a
public meeting hosted by Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Kennecott Minerals bought the property last September with plans to
process ore from its proposed Eagle Project. Without legal permits to
develop Eagle, the company continues to push permits for this
processing facility, which was not part of the original mine plan.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Department of Environmental Quality would have to approve
Kennecott's application before the company could reopen the facility.
The meeting schedule is as follows:</p>

      <p>this post on &quot;<a href="http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/">how twitter was born</a>&quot; is making the rounds; thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/pzriddle">Prentiss Riddle</a> for alerting me to it.&#0160;&#0160; The best quote from it is the use case that involves the worst possible internet device in the world: text messages from a mobile phone.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">I remember that @Jack’s first use case was city-related: telling people that the club he’s at is <em>happening</em>.
“I want to have a dispatch service that connects us on our phones using
text.” His idea was to make it so simple that you don’t even think
about what you’re doing, you just type something and send it. Typing
something on your phone in those days meant you were probably messing
with T9 text input, unless you were sporting a relatively rare
smartphone. Even so, everyone in our group got the idea instantly and
wanted it.</p><p>As a point of comparison, here&#39;s<a href="http://yourtech.typepad.com/main/2007/04/from_the_archiv.html"> part of the origin story for Gopher</a>, the early 1990s internet system:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Full-text searching was like a new thing under the sun five years ago,&quot; notes McCahill.&#0160; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The
two, with assistance from the newly formed Gopher Team, fine-tuned the
prototype as music from Nirvana and Mudhoney blared in the background. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;It
was a fun time,&quot; recalls team member Torrey. &quot;It was a lot of late
nights and weekends and a lot of beer, pizza and speed metal.&quot; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Eventually, the team needed some files to dump into their baby Gopher so they could demonstrate its text-searching capability.&#0160; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We
took the Usenet (the Internet&#39;s newsgroup system) cookbook and put that
into it,&quot; says McCahill. &quot;That was the first thing - so first the
Gopher was serving recipes up. We figured everybody ate, and it was a
good way of illustrating what full-text searching could do.&quot; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If
you were looking for recipes with eggplant, you simply typed in the
word and the application would locate every eggplant reference - a
dazzling capability in 1991. </p><p>nothing quite like having a real use for the system you build while building it.</p>

potential exists for additional outages as the weight of snow and ice
can be enough to snap or bend tree limbs, causing them to bring down
power lines disrupting electrical service. In severe ice storms, the
weight of large accumulations of ice on power lines themselves can
cause the lines to fall without the involvement of trees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>From President Obama in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/FreedomofInformationAct/" target="_blank">memo to the heads of federal agencies</a>:
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires
transparency.&#0160; As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “sunlight is said to be
the best of disinfectants.”&#0160; In our democracy, the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through
transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national
commitment to ensuring an open Government.&#0160; At the heart of that
commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the
Government and the citizenry alike.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a
clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.&#0160; The
Government should not keep information confidential merely because
public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and
failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract
fears.&#0160; Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the
personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they
are supposed to serve.&#0160; In responding to requests under the FOIA,
executive branch agencies (agencies) should act promptly and in a
spirit of cooperation, recognizing that such agencies are servants of
the public.</em></p>

Ill., January 26, 2008 – Starting today, legal educators will have the
capability to search, make use of, and share more legal educational
materials than ever before. The Center for Computer-Assisted Legal
Instruction (“<a href="http://cali.org">CALI</a>”), in collaboration with Harvard’s Berkman Center
for Internet and Society, is launching an open, searchable collection
of resources designed specifically for use in legal education: a “Legal
Education Commons” (“<a href="http://www.cali.org/lec">LEC</a>”). </span><strong><span style="font-family: Avenir;"><o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">“All
teachers of law have materials and notes they use in teaching,” says
John Mayer, CALI Executive Director. “Many freely share their materials
with colleagues, but there has never been a singular searchable,
taggable space to serve that function for the entire legal academy,” he
explains, “until now.” The LEC is available online at www.cali.org/lec.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">FINDING TEACHING MATERIALS IN LEC<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">The
Legal Education Commons launches with over 700,000 federal court
decisions readily available to its users. This initial collection of
cases from public.resource.org makes the LEC one of the largest
gatherings of case law freely available in one place under a creative
commons license. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">CALI
has also donated 300 original illustrations from its popular online
tutorials, “CALI Lessons,” making the Legal Education Commons the first
and largest pool of free images designed specifically for use in legal
education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the LEC opens with an extensive collection of court cases and images,
it can expand its collection of resources only through contributions
and donations from the legal education community. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">CALI
implores faculty and staff at CALI member schools to share any files
from personal collections that may facilitate learning amongst the
legal education community. “Especially as we increasingly garner more
participation and sharing from legal educators,” says Mr. Mayer, “the
Legal Education Commons will be a great, non-commercial tool for those
who are both teaching and learning the law.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Avenir;">Faculty

      </h3>
      <p>One of my very favorite weblogs from Michigan Tech is the aptly named <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">Backyard Arthropod Project: A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>, which is written in a style that a professional metallurgist and amateur entomologist can do.&#0160; It&#39;s hosted on somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com .</p><p>This week&#39;s post is a very lovely photo set of a Canadian Tiger Swallowtail butterfly.&#0160; The account of the identification of the <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/7367"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Papilio canadensis</span></a> is accompanied by a story of how it was collected, footnoted of course, with this note about the use of the word &quot;snarge&quot;:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">[2] I just heard this word on the news recently, as a direct result
of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,602092,00.html">the airliner that had to ditch in the Hudson river when its engines
both quit, possibly due to birds getting sucked into them</a>. It seems
that, when birds hit aircraft, the FAA always wants to know what <em>kind</em>
of bird it was, so that they can figure out their habits and try to
work out how to keep them away from the planes. So, they send any
remains that they find stuck to the plane afterwards to the <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/highlight/feathers/">Smithsonian
Institution’s Feather Identification Laboratory</a>, who figure out what it
was when it was alive. The technical term for these remains is
“snarge”. Technically, I suppose it is limited to what you get when
birds collide with aircraft, but I think it is legitimate to generalise
it to “remains of any animal after colliding with any vehicle”. So the
bug smears on your windshield, and the moths in your radiator, are all
snarge.</p><p>When my stepdad used to collect recently deceased animals to have his students check for parasites for his biology classes at Northern Michigan University, we called it roadkill; I guess snarge is a fancy federal name for airborne roadkill.</p><p>The <a href="http://wildlife-mitigation.tc.faa.gov/public_html/index.html">FAA Airport Wildlife Hazard
Mitigation Home Page</a> has much much more information on this topic, including a searchable database of bird strikes and lots of detailed data. </p>

&#0160;Faculty Candidate Talk:<br />
&quot;Understanding and Modeling Properties of Social Networks&quot; Lars
Backstrom is a graduate student at Cornell University in the Computer
Science Department. His work is supported by a Yahoo Research
Fellowship. In this talk¸ he will describe how social networks have
always been an integral part of people&#39;s lives. Until recently¸ these
networks have remained hidden¸ or been exposed only on very small
scales¸ where it is impossible to deduce more general trends. With the
advent of Web sites like Facebook and MySpace¸ however¸ we can begin to
develop models of social networks which capture the trends governing
the growth and evolution of these networks. With rich datasets from
multiple networks¸ researchers are now able to glean general principles
which give insight into the nature of social networks. </p><p>Backstrom will
discuss two questions related to our understanding of social networks.
First¸ he will look at some of the principles related to the formation
of new edges in social networks. Second¸ he will look at the growth of
explicitly declared communities in networks. He will discuss how the
evolution of these communities relates to the properties of the
underlying social network. He will wrap up his talk by discussing some
of the thorny privacy issues surrounding the study of these networks.</p><p>
All are invited to attend. To promote in-depth intellectual engagement
during the seminar¸ all are encouraged to <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/research/papers/backstrom_paper_012109.pdf" target="_blank">read

– The Ann Arbor Transportation Authority (AATA) is seeking public input
on proposed changes to its fare structure for fixed-route and
paratransit services at a series of public meetings to be held in
February.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">According
to AATA Board Chair David Nacht, the adult full fare for AATA
fixed-route service has not changed since August, 2002. Since that
time, AATA has experienced significant increases in the cost of
operations, as well as the tightening of available funding. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">“AATA
has cut costs for aspects of our operations under our control, as well
as generating revenue through the sale of advertising space on our
buses,” Nacht said.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA
reduced its 2009 fixed-route operating costs by $5 per service hour
through a variety of cost-saving measures. A review of comparable
transit systems revealed that AATA had the lowest fares among its peers.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">In
addition, AATA has implemented continuous improvement teams to further
control and reduce energy use, facility and vehicle maintenance,
employee benefits and expenses related to its paratransit services.
Approximately $300,000 in savings has been identified by the teams
through projects which are expected to be implemented in the current
fiscal year.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">“The
board is reluctant to raise fares, and actually rejected a fare
increase proposal in 2006. Now we find that we must balance the impact
on our riders with our need to run the authority in a financially
prudent manner.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA
has reached the point where we must consider revisions to our fare
structure in order to assure that we are successful in meeting the
growing demand for our services during this time of economic challenge,
and also to ensure the future financial health of the authority,” Nacht
said.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">AATA’s
proposal includes a two-phase increase to change the current
fixed-route adult full fare of $1.00 to $1.25 in May, 2009 and to $1.50
in May, 2010. Current half-fare charges would go from 50 cents to 60
and 75 cents, respectively. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The
proposal would eliminate the 25-cent fare on fixed-route service for
Seniors and A-Ride customers; however, the fares on paratransit service
would increase from $2.00 for an advance reservation trip to $2.50 in
2009 and $3.00 in 2010. Same-day trip fares would increase from $3.00
to $3.50 and $4.00, respectively.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Night Ride and Holiday Ride fares would remain at $5.00, with the fare for Senior and A-Ride cardholders remaining at $2.50.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">In
addition to 30-day passes, shorter-term passes are being considered at
both regular and reduced-fare levels. These may include passes for a
smaller number of days, or a specific number of trips.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The full draft proposal is available on the AATA web site, <a href="http://www.TheRide.org" target="_blank">www.TheRide.org</a>,
and by request at 734.973.6500. The proposal will also be available
beginning January 24, 2009 in the February, 2009 issue of “RideLines”
on all AATA buses and at the AATA main office and transit centers.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span><font face="Arial">The
proposed fare structure is expected to generate an estimated $314,000
in additional revenue in the first year and $540,000 in the second
year. It will also create opportunities for frequent riders who qualify
to take advantage of discounted passes.</font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt; line-height: normal;"><font face="Arial">Comments
and questions about the proposed fare changes are being received by
AATA through February 27, 2009 by the following methods:</font></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">January 18, 2009: </span></strong></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Based on this information, and on the current
state of the investigation, the FDA recommends that consumers avoid
eating products that have been recalled and discard them.&#0160; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Because identification of products
subject to recall is continuing, the FDA urges consumers to postpone
eating commercially-prepared or manufactured peanut butter-containing
products and institutionally-served peanut butter until further
information becomes available about which products may be
affected.&#0160;Efforts to specifically identify those products are ongoing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a very active and dynamic investigation into the source of the<em> Salmonella</em> Typhimurium outbreak.&#0160; At this time, the FDA has traced a source of<em> Salmonella</em>
Typhimurium contamination to a plant owned by Peanut Corporation of
America (PCA), which manufactures both peanut butter that is
institutionally served in such settings as long-term care facilities
and cafeterias, and peanut paste?a concentrated product consisting of
ground, roasted peanuts?that is distributed to food manufacturers to be
used as an ingredient in many commercially produced products including
cakes, cookies, crackers, candies, cereal and ice cream.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The FDA has notified PCA that product samples
originating from its Blakely, Ga., processing plant have been tested
and found positive for<em> Salmonella</em> by laboratories in the
states of Minnesota and Georgia.&#0160; The state of Minnesota has reported
to FDA that its samples of King Nut peanut butter are a genetic match
to the strain of<em> Salmonella</em> that has caused illnesses in that state and around the country.&#0160; King Nut is a distributor of PCA product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On January 16, PCA expanded its voluntary recall
to include all peanut butter produced on or after August 8, 2008, and
all peanut paste produced on or after September 26, 2008, in its
Blakely, Ga., plant because of potential<em> Salmonella</em>
contamination.&#0160; The product being recalled is sold by PCA in bulk
packaging in containers ranging in size from five to 1700 pounds.&#0160; The
peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from 35-pound containers to
product sold by the tanker container.&#0160; These products are not sold
directly to consumers.&#0160; PCA has stopped all production at its Blakely,
Ga. plant as the FDA continues its investigation into the source of the<em> Salmonella</em> contamination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At this time, there is no indication that any
national name brand jars of peanut butter sold in retail stores are
linked to the PCA recall.&#0160; As the investigation continues over the
weekend, and into next week, the FDA will be able to update the advice
based on new sampling and distribution information.&#0160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The FDA is working closely with members of the
food industry to narrow this advice and to publish a detailed list of
implicated products as soon as possible.&#0160; The FDA is encouraging
manufacturers to help inform consumers about whether their
products&#0160;could have contained&#0160;commercially prepared peanut butter or
peanut paste from PCA.&#0160; Also, if manufacturers know their products do
not&#0160;contain ingredients from PCA, they may wish to inform consumers of
that fact.&#0160; Retailers should stop selling products which have been
recalled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For information on products containing peanut
butter from companies not reporting recalls, consumers may wish to
consult the company?s website or call the toll-free number listed on
most packaging.&#0160; Information consumers may receive from the companies
has not been verified by the FDA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The FDA will closely monitor these events by
continuing to work with the firms on the details of their actions,
conduct follow-up audits and inspections, monitor the progress of the
firms? actions, and notify our foreign regulatory counterparts of
products that may have been distributed internationally.</font></p></font></td></tr></tbody></table>
