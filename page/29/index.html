<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Press release from the City of Ann Arbor</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>E. Stadium Bridges Dedication Ceremony is Tuesday, May 14, 10 a.m.</p>

<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 11, 2013 — A brief dedication ceremony for the City of Ann Arbor’s E. Stadium Bridges Replacement Project will be held at 10 a.m., Tuesday, May 14, 2013 near 1501 S. State Street, next to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street. Congressman John Dingell will be joined with representatives from the national Department of Transportation, as well as officials from MDOT, Washtenaw County, City of Ann Arbor, project contractors, neighbors, and the general public. Temporary public parking will be available on the UM Red Lot adjacent to the bridge over S. State Street.</p>

<p>Within 12 months, the E. Stadium Bridges Reconstruction Project built two new bridges, on-street bike lanes, a new sidewalk on the south side--and a widened sidewalk along the north side--of E. Stadium Boulevard, a new sidewalk along the west side of S. State Street with a signalized pedestrian crossing of the railroad tracks, two staircases connecting E. Stadium Boulevard to S. State Street, ADA-compliant facilities with an accessible path between S. State Street and E. Stadium Boulevard, storm water quality<br />
improvements, new water mains, improvements to Rose-White Park, landscaping, and many other features.</p>

<p>The City of Ann Arbor received funding from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for $13.9 million in TIGER II Discretionary Grant Funding, and about $1.67 million and $1.20 million, respectively, in Local Bridge Program and Transportation Enhancement Funding. All told, the City received about $16.8 million (or about 73 percent of the total estimated project costs) in state and federal funds to complete the project. The remaining 27 percent of the project was funded via various city sources including the Ann Arbor voter-approved Street and Bridge Resurfacing & Reconstruction Millage as the required local-match for the grants. Public notifications of developments in the E. Stadium Bridges project have been posted at www.annarborbridges.org.</p>

<p>The previous E. Stadium Bridges were built in 1928. The bridges carry more than 24,000 vehicles per day.</p>

It&#39;s OK to say which county you located the morels in, but don&#39;t narrow it down any more than that. I happen to know that morels can be found in Marquette County, but even my mom won&#39;t always provide an exact location.</p>
<p>With this mapping in mind, here&#39;s a few sources for early morel sightings in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michigan-Morels/261288532041" target="_self">Michigan Morels</a> has daily reports with photos of people showing off the results of their hunt. No maps, but lots of county reports.</p>
<p>MorelHunters.com (&quot;Where the hunters gather&quot;) has a <a href="http://morelhunters.com/" target="_self">morel progression map</a> on their front page. The Michigan bit of it is included below, as of 1 May 2013.</p>
<p>

      <p>I&#39;ve done a bunch of things in my life, so many so that a traditional style resume gets impossibly bulky if I have to add more than a few words per job.</p>
<p>Would it be too much to convert a resume to shorthand? There must be emoji that describe job qualities. A job that you didn&#39;t like might get <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/02/unicode-character-pile-of-poo-u1f4a9/" target="_self">this unicode character</a>, for instance.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I do a lot of writing in vim these days, in part because my fingers already know how to make words move around on the page. I find it easier to do the work in a place where I can rely on muscle memory for routine changes rather than have to laboriously guide the mouse around to do edits.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was an outlining tool called MaxThink (it still exists, for Windows only) that applied the same kind of keyboard-heavy work to outline editing. MaxThink is unique as far as I know in that in addition to the typical kind of outline commands it also had powerful operations like &quot;bin sort&quot; that operated on the outline as a whole. If you had learned the system (and it was non-trivial to learn) you could re-sort a collection of headings faster than you could pick up any one of them with a mouse.</p>
<p>If you can get to the point where your fingers know how to get the desired results onto the page, writing and editing can be very quick. I&#39;ll admit to only learning a working subset of vim - there are lots of commands that I never use - but the ones that I do have in my brain really don&#39;t require thinking to take on.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Category-diagram.png"><img alt="image from upload.wikimedia.org" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeab11984970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeab11984970d-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="image from upload.wikimedia.org" /></a><br />Wikipedia is going through one of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2013_April_24#Category:American_women_novelists" target="_self">periodic existential crises</a>, this time over the use of categories. A diligent editor created a category of &quot;American women novelists&quot; and began adding female novelists to it, and then removing them from the category &quot;American novelists&quot;. A predictable hue and cry ensued. James Gleick tells the story in some detail in the NY Review of Books, under the title &quot;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/29/wikipedia-women-problem/" target="_self">Wikipedia&#39;s Women Problem</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Categorization is hard in a Wikipedia world. The namespace for articles is flat, so there&#39;s no implicit categories assigned simply by what a page is named. On the other hand, categories can contain subcategories, and the Wikipedia editors take advantage of this to create elaborate categorical structures. Everything is part of something else, in some extended rhetorical tangle. (The image is from the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization" target="_self">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>.)</p>
<p>Categories don&#39;t have to have subcategories, of course; that&#39;s a convention that&#39;s not universal to all wiki software. Localwiki&#39;s equivalent structure looks more like tags, and tags are in one big flat namespace with no explicit hierarchy.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the choice is how to best improve findability of articles, and how to incorporate a distinctive feel to a system. Wikipedia has &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Doughnuts" target="_self">Category:Doughnuts</a>&quot;, with one subcategory &quot;Doughnut shops&quot; which in turn has a subcategory &quot;Tim Hortons&quot; which in turn has 12 pages, including Timbits. Arborwiki has a page <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Donuts" target="_self">Donuts</a>, which includes pages tagged with the tag &quot;donuts&quot;, and is in turn tagged as &quot;Pastries that are not strange&quot;. (And yes, there is a &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/tags/pastriesthatarestrange" target="_self">Pastries that are strange</a>&quot; tag as well.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a problem when the technically correct task of splitting a big category into smaller parts runs smack into the political minefield of deciding which part of the category is to be primary and which is to be secondary. No one wants to be secondary, and no reasonable system would always yield category warring. Perhaps Wikipedia has bumped up against some size limit where it&#39;s impossible for any one person to understand the complexity of the classification system it has built.</p>

<p>
A number of Windstream Corp. customers in the greater Charlotte area are experiencing service outages affected by what the company is calling “a widespread outage affecting long-distance and toll-free call processing.”
The outage occurred around 11:30 a.m., said company spokesman David Avery.
Though the Arkansas-based company hasn’t stated how far the outage extends, posts on Twitter and Facebook suggest the outage is multi-state.

      </h3>
      <p>I had the good fortune to talk about <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a> at eChicago in April 2013. Here are the notes that I took in preparation for the talk; the actual text of the talk varied from this, since I was speaking impromptu.</p>
<p><strong>About Arborwiki</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who: </strong>More than a dozen core contributors over the lifespan of the project, plus many more who have made small edits to pages.</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Greater Ann Arbor - including Washtenaw County and the farmers who come to the Farmers Market from surrounding counties.</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>: Started in September 2005 as a class project at Community High School, then moved to servers at the Ann Arbor District Library.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>: About 10,000 pages, including the most popular <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Birthday Deals</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Volunteer_Opportunities" target="_self">Volunteer Opportunities</a>, and perennial favorite <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Donuts" target="_self">Donuts</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/paczki" target="_self">Paczki</a> pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: To build community information about the Ann Arbor area.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding principles</strong></p>
<p>Locality, not notability, is the main criterion for relevance; if it&#39;s here, then it&#39;s relevant.</p>
<p>Take a local point of view, not a neutral point of view; original text and personal views welcomed.</p>
<p>Lots of external links to reference sources.</p>
<p><strong>State of the project</strong></p>
<p>Arborwiki is a mature system - it has over 10,000 pages in it, and thus there&#39;s likely to be something about most things that people might look for that are relevant to the Ann Arbor area.</p>
<p>One advantage to maturity is that a lot of people know about the project through a popular &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Birthday Deals</a>&quot; page, and we don&#39;t have to explain in the abstract what we&#39;re working on - that individual page gets about two hundred visits per day.</p>
<p>A second advantage is that we&#39;ve gotten tremendous amounts of cooperation from the <a href="http://aadl.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor District Library</a> system, including help with research, links, technical support, and free hosting for this community project.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges of a mature system</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s no &quot;new wiki&quot; smell, and we can&#39;t count on having a barn-raising strategy for people who want to document their community for the first time. Any enthusiasm has to be in the context of a lot of things that already exist.</p>
<p>The core of regular contributors is relatively small compared to the number of pages in the system. It would take 30+ page edits per day of existing pages just to get enough eyes on the older parts of Arborwiki just to keep each page refreshed to be less than a year since its latest edit.</p>
<p>There are too many short, uninformative pages with just a single bare link and no photo, no map, no template etc. One editor - and that would be me - went through a long period of emphasizing quantity over quality. Now that the quantity is there, it&#39;s time to focus on quality.</p>
<p>The site needs more photos and better support from photographers.</p>
<p><strong>The Ypsiwiki problem</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a separate <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ypsiwiki" target="_self">Ypsiwiki</a> which covered Ypsilanti. It was decided to merge those pages in because there was too much project overlap and not quite enough of a critical mass to keep the two systems separate. The Arborwiki name was retained, and as a result, there&#39;s resistance overall from contributors from Ypsilanti to contribute to a project that&#39;s not theirs.</p>
<p><strong>What to do next</strong></p>
<p>Improve the most popular pages on the site. Use Google Analytics to identify the pages that get the most traffic, and go through them page by page to ensure that they are up to date, correct, accurate, and informative.</p>
<p>Create new pages based on a &quot;Page not found&quot; report from Google Analytics, noting where people click on terms that get them to a blank or empty page.</p>
<p>Visit a random page in the site and make it better. Add a map, a photograph, a category, or a paragraph of information.</p>
<p>Learn the seasonal rhythms of the site. For example, the Paczki page gets traffic for about a week a year, but the Donuts page gets steady traffic year round.</p>
<p>Follow public meetings like the meetings of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ann_Arbor_City_Council" target="_self">Ann Arbor City Council</a>, and tweet out links to projects or issues that are relevant agenda items.</p>
<p>Wish someone a happy birthday by sending them a link to the Birthday Deals page on Facebook.</p>
<p>Reward new contributors by recognizing them in public through Facebook or Twitter links to their new contributions.</p>
<p>Recognize that a Localwiki project has a natural size, and identify where you are in the process.</p>
<p>Pay attention to traffic patterns - popular pages, referral sites, keywords used.</p>
<p>If you want traffic, track the news, and befriend local media so that they are aware of the resource.</p>

<p>For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.</p>
<p>I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them. A good, tidy, modern blog that is comprehensive in some narrow sphere would have a tidy list of categories and would post in each of them regularly enough to be helpful. In contrast, a laundry list of one-time enthusiams just makes it pointedly clear when my interests have waxed and waned.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Typepad doesn&rsquo;t have a straightforward way to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; a blog post to the top of a category, the same way that it can mark a post to stay on top of the main page. That makes it trickier to create permanent navigation within a category.</p>
<p>I do hope to put together some better navigation, so that someone coming to the blog for the first time can read some more popular posts or ones that I like. The whole thing has long since gone from a narrow, coherent narrative and turned into an unpolished open notebook, gathering scraps from here and there and not always pieces that have an obvious relation to the work as a whole. If it were a real scrapbook it would have tape-tags sticking out of it at all angles in all colors flagging things that deserve to be seen again; that doesn&rsquo;t have to be done with categories.</p></p>

No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&#39;m working on upper right.</p>
<p>The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little hurt by making the sidebars full of white space, but not much. My paper notebooks have lots of marginalia, but they are marginalia that change with every page, and a lot of it is sidebar note-to-self rather than publishable anything. Still, the pages load <strong><em>a lot faster</em></strong> when they don&#39;t have quite so much crap on them, and I haven&#39;t even started to explore adding more stuff at the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typepad.com" target="_self">Typepad</a> is particularly good as a place to play with designs, they have a lot of premade ones that look much better than anything I would cobble together on my own (see e.g. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html" target="_self">this early effort</a> which I wrote in vi, which is probably where I&#39;d start from if left to my own devices).</p>
<p>Pages load a lot faster. Zoom! And that alone is worthwhile to do a redesign for.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Some will say that you should schedule your posts or tweets for a certain particular time of day, when it&#39;s scientifically proven (by data scientists) that you&#39;ll get the maximum number of page views or retweets or some other measure of progress. (Bitly says <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/05/09/best-time-to-post-on-facebook/" target="_self">Monday between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern is good</a>.)</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#39;s true, but here&#39;s the argument for posting now rather than scheduling into the near future. If you have scheduled posts, you have to perpetually be on the alert for breaking news that will make your pre-planned messaging look inappropriate or off-key. You&#39;re also giving up any chance to engage in a spontaneous one on one conversation with someone who is listening right now.</p>
<p>Do you have something to say? Say it now. There&#39;s always going to be an opportunity to repeat yourself at the optimum time, and if it&#39;s good enough, you can repeat yourself over and over again. (Repetition is the very soul of the net.) Don&#39;t get so hung up on laser-targeted optimization that you miss the essence of the network as an ongoing conversation.</p>

In Wikipedia, every article is measured against a broad global sense of &quot;notability&quot;. An individual or a topic has to be notable and newsworthy enough to be included, and though the standards vary there is some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTABILITY" target="_self">global consensus to what it means</a>. If an article doesn&#39;t meet the grade, it&#39;s subject to deletion.
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>On a <a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a>, every article is measured against an individual sense of &quot;locality&quot;. An individual or topic has to be relevant to that location that is being covered. Standards vary widely, but the general feeling I get is that if you put the subject&#39;s dot on a map and the dot is too far from the center of gravity of the Localwiki, it will be rejected.</p>
<p>This gives curious and interesting results. It means that the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Great_Shanghai_Restaurant" target="_self">closing of an otherwise un-notable buffet restaurant in a strip mall</a> is notable enough for a Localwiki simply because it&#39;s local, but also that people making worldwide headlines don&#39;t have a place in a Localwiki (unless of course they have some particular and peculiar tie to a single location).&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself wishing that more places had local wikis - the process of editing is much less demanding when you simply need to identify that something is of local interest vs. going up against the global test. And locality is still ambiguous, but not so much as to be impossible to gauge.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Runtastic is a workout tracking program for Android. It lets you keep track of where you have gone on your run, bike ride, or walk (or a bunch of other means of locomotion) and using the GPS in the phone makes some estimate of how far you&#39;ve gone and how much effort you have expended.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also used Cardiotrainer for this purpose, which has a similar reason for being.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really handy to have your device track where you go so that you get a nice map of your journey. Those trips where you&#39;re trying to find your way through an unfamiliar neighborhood generate a trail of breadcrumbs you can follow, and it&#39;s really helpful to have a good sense for how far away a mile is while walking. (For me, it&#39;s a mile to the Michigan Union.)</p>
<p>Both Runtastic and Cardiotrainer have a synthesized voice to give you details of your progress as you go. Runtastic is rather more sparing in its narration, which I find just fine. Both systems allow you to log your progress to a variety of online media like Facebook.</p>
<p>I started out using Cardiotrainer, and it wanted me to log a trip every day and keep track of myself. When I used to wear a pedometer, that was really easy to do, and I could type in a few numbers every few days and feel like I was keeping up with myself. It doesn&#39;t make sense to have any of these running all the time, and so I was fine with Runtastic keeping that detail in the background for me rather than the foreground.</p>
<p>Runtastic also has a feature, as of yet incompletely tested, that lets you know where your friends are right now on the map. That&#39;s actually the feature I want more than any to test out, because it points to the possibility that you could use this for something even a little more like a real time channel for careful coordination of where people are and what they&#39;re doing. I&#39;m imagining getting lost and having this be helpful.</p>

<p>Both apps are free, and both have Pro or Paid versions that unlock a few more features.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From the Bitcointalk forums, 2011: &quot;<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=19392.0" target="_self">Bitcoins are peacock tails</a>&quot;</p>
<p><em>A series of studies, &quot;Peacocks, Porsches and Thorstein Veblen: Conspicuous Consumption as a Sexual Signaling System,&quot; was published recently in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&#0160;A peacock&#39;s tail is beautiful: magnificent plumage, iridescent colors. Alas, it is also wasteful. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to develop. Sound like bitcoins?</em></p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the Bitcoin as a signal of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22153687" target="_self">BBC reports, quoting Blockchain</a>, that current Bitcoin miners are consuming $147,000 per day in electricity, and generating $681,000 in profiles from the mining. That doesn&#39;t count any of the investment in hardware for Bitcoin mining rigs, which has its own embedded hardware and energy cost.</p>
<p>That you get a Bitcoin as a result of burning energy and setting up equipment is a perfect signal (for those who are tuned into it) that you have the technical skills and cash resources to create some new token of value. It&#39;s valuable to the extent that it&#39;s difficult to create, and if you don&#39;t have the patience to create it, you can buy them up for cash <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2013/0412/Winklevoss-twins-try-to-buy-up-bitcoin-market" target="_self">like the Winkelvoss twins are said to have done</a>.</p>
<p>Now to quote my favorite cranky Norwegian immigrant economist, <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1902veblen00.asp" target="_self">Thorstein Veblen (1902):</a></p>
<p><em>Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer&#39;s good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities. In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.</em></p>
<p>Bitcoins are almost the perfect expression of conspicuous waste, and in a benefit that Veblen might not have guessed at, they are liquid in a peculiar way such that it&#39;s impossible to distinguish between someone who has purchased them vs. someone who has a mining rig going full bore creating them. How peculiar a commodity to have no intrinsic value that&#39;s obvious right now, but that is a perfect signal either that you have consumed a lot of energy or a lot of money to have acquired them. In this sense they look like they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_self">Veblen goods</a>, where they are more in demand depending on them being more expensive.</p>

<p><em>Boeing’s fixes include better insulation for the batteries’ eight cells, and a stainless steel box designed to encase the batteries and contain fire and vent possible smoke or hazardous gases out of the planes. Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s chief engineer for the 787, said that the tests performed in the last month showed the batteries were now much less likely to overheat.</em></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every year on Earth Day I do a ritual weeding of our back yard garden and pick whatever garlic mustard I can find. We&#39;ve been thinning out the garlic mustard every year for years and so it&#39;s mostly in check but it&#39;s always worth pulling a few more plants.</p>
<p>Aside from putting the garlic mustard in the municipal compost - not your own compost - there&#39;s always a temptation to eat at least some of what gets pulled. The challenge is making sure that you cook the garlic mustard so that the yucky compounds that make it indigestable get cooked out. Even though the leaves are so tender that you don&#39;t really need to cook them very much, it&#39;s recommended to cook garlic mustard in two changes of water to leach out the bad parts.</p>
<p>The Three Foragers have a recipe for &quot;<a href="http://the3foragers.blogspot.com/2012/04/garlic-mustard-recipe-garlic-mustard.html" target="_self">Garlic Mustard Roulade</a>&quot; which looks mighty fancy, but they also have good suggestions for handling this spring green. As they note, &quot;Garlic mustard might not be for everyone, but it is nutritious, highly invasive and easily gathered in&#0160;quantity.&quot;&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My first reaction to the horrible events of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t look at pictures, especially not the graphic ones. There isn&#39;t time to react.</li>
<li>Focus on something small, like a neighbor who was running the marathon who is ok.</li>
<li>Mistrust many news sources, because some people will write anything to get attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Boston_Marathon_bombings" target="_self">Wikipedia page is pretty reasonable</a> for coverage, though from time to time nonsense sneaks in.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A <a href="http://hypervocal.com/news/2013/cnn-boston-wrong-twitter-snark/" target="_self">graph of Wednesday, April 17, 2003&#39;s nonsense</a> which had Twitter making fun of CNN.</p>

<p>
National Healthcare Decisions Day highlights the importance of advance healthcare decision-making.  As a participating organization, After Death Home Care is providing information and tools for the public to talk about their wishes with family, friends and healthcare providers, and execute written advance directives in accordance with Michigan laws.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, on April 16, from 6:30 – 8:30 pm, After Death Home Care is welcoming the public with information about advance care planning and advance directive forms. Merilynne Rush, RN, Natural Burial Specialist is joined by Patricia Lyndale, UM Hospital Chaplain, and John Erdevig, Attorney, to answer questions.
</p>
<p> 
National Healthcare Decisions Day encourages people in our community to have thoughtful conversations about their healthcare decisions and to complete reliable advance directives to make their wishes known.  As a result, more people will plan ahead before a health crisis, fewer families and healthcare providers will have to struggle with making difficult decisions when a patient can no longer do so, and more families will be able to honor their loved ones wishes.
