<h2 id="things-yet-to-do-in-this-weblog-setup:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Things yet to do in this weblog setup:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs etc</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been trying to keep up a daily pace to blogging here; that&#39;s been my habit for almost ten years. The problem is that it&#39;s not always easy to know what to write about.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day. E.g. on the 1st of the month be inspired by the letter &#39;A&#39; categories, on the 10th come up with something appropriate for &#39;J&#39;, and today the 23th come up with something to do with &#39;W&#39;. If you have enough categories, this actually isn&#39;t too hard; I have &quot;Weather&quot;, &quot;Web/Tech&quot;, &quot;Weblogs&quot;, &quot;Weird&quot;, &quot;Wiki&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, and &quot;Writing&quot; to choose from. X is much harder.</p>
<p>The same trick works to sort semi-randomly through your contact files, looking for the long-lost &quot;U&quot;-lettered friends on the 22d.</p>
<p>Equal attention by letters of the alphabet does not guarantee an equal balance of attention across all things; you&#39;d be better off somehow taking the old encyclopedic route of splitting C into Ca-Ch and Ci-Cz, and lumping W-X-Y-Z together.&#0160;</p>
<p>A little bit of deliberate randomness makes it appear as though you are more attentive to odd things than you might otherwise get if you just focused in on the simple things. Brainstorms that focus on something that are not for today&#39;s letter can be scheduled for posting into the future on the appropriate day-slot.&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself wishing that my contact manager would let me graph frequency of names across two dimensions, so that my name would be 5 across and 22 down, sorted together with all of the other E. V.&#39;s out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, just one more <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/great-weird-ideas" target="_self">great weird idea</a> to throw out into the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The original standards for the content of the RFC series, from <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a> by Steve Crocker, 1969. Note that these are also good standards for blogging.
<blockquote>
<h3>CONTENT</h3>
<p>
The content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related to
the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged to
be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions without examples
or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques
without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions
without any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum length for
a NWG note is one sentence.
</p>
<p>
These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto
authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of
considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural
hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this
inhibition.</p>

      <p>Ever since upgrading my Mac to 10.6.8 I&#39;ve been running into memory problems, especially when I have a lot of Chrome windows open. I solved this problem - or I seem to have - by upgrading from 2G to 4G of memory, with memory from <a href="http://www.crucial.com/" target="_self">Crucial</a>. Less than $100 spent, and the computer no longer starts to thrash when I have more than a few windows open.</p>
<p>Now of course it&#39;s time to keep a lot more apps open to see what the new system limits are.</p>

      <p><p>Flooding of the Bow and Elbow Rivers inundated downtown Calgary, Alberta on June 21, 2013. Flooding and flash flooding has affected large parts of southern Alberta, due in part to a slow-moving storm front that is dumping a lot of rain on the area, up to 7.5 inches in 2.5 days. Three people have died from the flooding.</p>

At the moment I&#39;m&#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!</p>
<p>The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.</p>
<p>Using his own cutting-edge research as a professor at Wharton Business School, Adam Grant shows how helping others can lead to greater personal success. He demonstrates how smart givers avoid becoming doormats, and why this kind of success has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organisations and communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m particularly intrigued by the notion that there&#39;s a distinction that creates &quot;smart givers&quot; that win some unspecified game through a generous strategy that pays off for them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are two obvious reasons why this might come up on the council rules agenda. One the presence of an individual (<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Thomas_Partridge" target="_self">Tom Partridge</a>) who generally uses every single public comment time available to him to speak his piece; in a single meeting, Partridge might account for 20+ minutes of public comment time. A second reason is the very effective &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Citizens_filibuster" target="_self">citizens filibuster</a>&quot; that several organized opposition groups have used to talk Council into the wee hours of the morning during public hearings. A well-organized group can bring forty or fifty people to the dais, accounting for two hours plus of a public hearing.</p>
<p>Reducing public comment time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes will slow down the frequent commenter, and additional rules to restrict individuals from commenting at successive sessions will further cut into their time and leave room for others to speak. Capping citizens participation time to 2 minutes during public hearings is less likely to have an impact on total meeting times, however. A group that&#39;s capable of corralling 45 citizens to speak out will just have to get 68 in front of the cameras to make the same point. Never underestimate the number of issues where the irate citizenry will work as hard as they can to make an impact on their elected decisionmakers.</p>
Having a robust public process can be mighty inconvenient at times.<br /><ol>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a fickle relationship with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems/" target="_self">reminder systems</a>. Usually the drill is to discover something new, vigorously dump everything I can possibly think into it, and then slowly but surely get disillusioned with it as time goes on. The smell of a new system is seductive, and when something new comes along there&#39;s a tendency to look at its good side and to focus on the bad parts of whatever you were using before.</p>
<p>Thus my latest desire is to stop using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">Github as an issue tracking system</a> for personal reminders, and to start using Evernote. I&#39;ve written about Github before; the truth of it is that it&#39;s not a bad system, but it&#39;s set up enough for multi-person use that some of the easy affordances of single person use go to the wayside. Besides, my own use of it has tapered off and that&#39;s a sign that something new needs to take its place.</p>
<p>Evernote hasn&#39;t been written about much here, but there&#39;s a lot that I am starting to like about it. The <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/06/06/evernote-reminders-arrive-on-android/?utm_source=vacuum" target="_self">Android</a> support for reminders is new. Android support in general it lags a bit behind iOS. The level that I&#39;m currently using it it&#39;s still free. Their reminder system is new, but still looks at least minimally functional enough to get the work done. Since it fits in my phone pretty well it seems as though I should be able to make the transition and not be pinned down in front of my computer screen when it&#39;s time to brainstorm what to do next.</p>
<p>Basically it&#39;s what every new system is, the new system smell, while it&#39;s still revolutionary and not the politburo. Enjoy the new system before you figure out how to routinize it into distraction.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-13-writing-up-a-fire-storm/">Writing up a (fire) storm</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p>Since yesterday, thousands of people have read <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/06/black-forest-fire-near-colorado-springs-colorado-with-map.html" target="_self">my brief account of the Black Forest Fire</a>. I tried to include enough maps that someone far away from the fire (like me) would find some context for it that made sense, and enough detailed links to more local reporting and official sources that someone nearby would be able to get to the resource that had more current and on-the-spot coverage than I could ever do.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written fire-related posts before, including one for the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/duck-lake-fire-north-of-newberry-mi.html" target="_self">Duck Lake Fire near Newberry, MI</a> last year. I make sure to get good detailed maps of that area, because there&#39;s a pattern that burned-over areas provide good morel mushroom hunting the year after and good blueberry picking grounds for years to come.</p>
<p>When fires hit near an urban area, there&#39;s an immediate influx of television and newspaper resources to help local residents sort through what people have to do to keep themselves and their homes safe. Imagery from fires is dramatic. When it&#39;s time to put this information on a map, it&#39;s a real challenge in real-time cartography in an environment where you might not always know exact details.</p>
<p>Writing about fires is thus a way to simultaneously make sense of the news and participate in its creation. You try to not make matters worse by carefully time and date stamping your observations so that it doesn&#39;t become old news that recirculates as new. Twitter is helpful but oh so fragmented, and most of the people I know through that channel are far enough away from any given incident not to care very much. The traffic to my Black Forest Fire page came in overwhelmingly from search, and the most common search term was &quot;black forest fire map&quot; - exactly the first thing that I was looking for when I heard about it. If you can answer &quot;where is this thing happening&quot;, &quot;do I know anyone nearby&quot;, and &quot;who knows more about it than I do&quot;, you can get to a point where your combination of links becomes a resource.</p>

<p>The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog. Lots of photos and news are showing up on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackForestFire&src=hash">#blackforestfire</a> Twitter tag. Residents can call 719-444-8300 for information on the fire, but no exact information is available on individual homes yet. Official info from <a href="http://www.elpasoco.com/Pages/default.aspx">El Paso County</a> will be <em>more current than this page</em>.</p>

It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). When you go back to reread what&#39;s been written down, some part of the memories come back. If you&#39;re lucky and captured some particularly salient point, the entire memory - the entire conversation - can return and you&#39;ll be transported back to another time and place.</p>
<p>A weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something that&#39;s not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you again. You&#39;d really rather never have to go through the ordeal again but just in case someone else happens on it you&#39;ll have that capsule of hard-won knowlege written down. You&#39;ll write it down so that you can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you&#39;ll relearn it as from new based on your old notes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating them with new information or with recollections that match the time. Every so often I&#39;ll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn&#39;t want to be something that I want to remember and that isn&#39;t forgotten yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don&#39;t want to be remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that I can&#39;t easily bring myself to completely deleting.</p>
<p>Some blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).</p>

I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel.</p>
<p>One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&#39;s playing now and who&#39;s playing whom. The front page rotates new songs that if you&#39;re a quick click you can hear more or less in their entirety as they are being broadcast.</p>
<p>A particularly useful part of TuneIn is its &quot;trending&quot; tab, where it gives you real time feedback on which channels have the most activity. When people are listening primarily to music, it&#39;s a slow news day; when the top station is an all-news local channel, there&#39;s breaking news.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&amp;hl=en" target="_self">TuneIn Android app</a> has nearly all of the features of the web site, and it takes advantage of knowing where you are to offer up local stations. In addition there&#39;s a &quot;TuneIn Radio Pro&quot;, which gives you record and rewind for $4.99. There has to be a monetization strategy in there somewhere; they also serve up ads as you connect to some channels.</p>
<p>Recommended. For public safety scanner monitoring, <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/" target="_self">Broadcastify</a> is a good complement.</p>

<p>Look at the categories on the right side of the screen - my screen, not yours. There&#39;s an infinite scrolling list of them, from &quot;Americana&quot; to &quot;zzz Draft Postings&quot;. Somehow, categories became the wrong way to describe what is in this blog; aside from &quot;Ann Arbor&quot;, there&#39;s few of them that have routine postings. But with almost 3000 articles written, it&#39;s had to imagine any coherent way to recategorize them.</p>
<p>The problem with categories, buckets, or really any hierarchical system for putting things in one place or another is that there&#39;s always the new thing that defies categorization and asks for its own category. I&#39;m not willing to have a big &quot;Other&quot; category, but I am willing to have an &quot;Oklahoma&quot; category that only gets a few posts a year (earthquakes, tornados).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve used systems that depend heavily on categorization to make them work. You set up some kind of ongoing task depending on how things or (worse) people are sorted into buckets. Suddenly the world needs bright divisions between one kind of thing and another kind of thing, and any ambiguity about status has to collapse into a single value to make the system make sense.</p>
<p>Some tools in my experience have been better than others for recategorization. I&#39;ve written before about Maxthink, a 1980s era MS-DOS &quot;idea processor&quot; (still available in Windows) that has a concept of &quot;binsort&quot;, which is an extraordinarily rapid and keyboard-driven way to shuffle and reshuffle items into a hierarchy. That system never really got enough traction to be copied wholesale by any other system, and so it lives on in the world only through dim memories and hardcore users. </p>
<p>Reshuffling a tree with lots of existing categories is really hard work, because short of wiping out all previous categorization and starting anew you are almost guaranteed to have some vestiges of the old order in place as you&#39;re trying to assert a new set of groupings. Even the infinitely flexible Wikipedia has this problem, as it inherited some parts of its classification system from older encyclopedias like Brittanica.</p>
<p>So I struggle with sorting through the contents and give up more often than not, relying instead on search rather than careful categorization to unearth old things and to draw relationships among nominally related works. It&#39;s the problem that <a href="http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/" target="_self">everything is miscellaneous</a>&#0160;and too many things are interrelated and that my knowledge of the world too often seems a mile wide and an inch deep.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem of miscellany is the tendency of our Internet to rot out from under us, with old sites and old links disappearing as people redesign or move on or give up. There&#39;s hardly any way to refer to something without quoting it nearly in full, for fear that when you want to go back to it there will be nothing there to see.&#0160;</p>
<p>I seem to be rambling, what was the point again? Oh, categories and their utter impossibility of reflecting the current real world and the horrific difficulties of rethinking them half way through your efforts to use them. It so happens that <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/categorization" target="_self">I have a categorization category</a>, which hopefully has some relationship to this brief essay.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.</p>
<p>Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home. Some stayed in Marquette, or came back after college, or moved to even smaller towns nearby.</p>
<p>Ask about their family, and you will find that some of your classmates are grandparents.</p>
<p>Ask about what they are doing. &#0160;I was surprised to find some of my classmates having had 25 or even 30 years of continuous career in the same field or even with the same employer.</p>
<p>I found myself mostly talking to people who I talked to in high school - as my friend Tim put it we found the &quot;geek table&quot; and occupied that. Some things never change, and all we would have needed was a Rubik&#39;s Cube and we could pick up where we left off.</p>
<p>People do change a lot in 30 years. A small handful of folks look remarkably like what they looked like 30 years ago, plus or minus an 80s hairdo. Others changed a lot, not always in a direction I would have expected.</p>
<p>There was a small shrine to the classmates who had died, and it was sad and surprising to see young faces and realize that you wouldn&#39;t be seeing them again, not here and not anywhere.</p>
<p>All in all, it was one of those parties that reminded me of the very few high school parties I went to - lots of people standing around drinking beer, a few people dancing, and the DJ playing the B-52s. I&#39;m looking forward to the next event some 5 or 10 years from now to see how we&#39;re still all holding up.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-08-how-did-i-meet-you-how-do-i-know-you/">How did I meet you? How do I know you?</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.</p>
<p>The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. If I can hit each of those three perspectives on a relationship, chances are that it&#39;s easy to start up a new conversation and easy to call someone to mind when it&#39;s time to make a new introduction.</p>
<p>Alas, most personal address book software does a lousy job of keeping tabs on any of this. You can add a &quot;related to&quot; field in some systems, but that&#39;s not something that I&#39;ve seen pulled out and turned into a full featured exploring tool. If you&#39;re lucky you get to enter some free text in some notes field, but even then you might not get the ability to search it on the fly. And heaven help you if you want to tag or group or categorize or classify people (for your own memory purposes) without fighting a system that generally is indifferent to the idea that people might belong to more than one group.</p>
<p>If I can dream, I&#39;d like the simple app - perhaps just a thin front end to my address book - that flashes names in front of me and helps me quickly remember who&#39;s who and how I might know them. This is multiply true right now because I have a lot of dormant connections to people that I&#39;d like to refresh. A smart address book, or a routine way of collecting that information in a dumb address book, should be able to help that process out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It turns out that one of the recent updates to LinkedIn adds a &quot;how did I meet you&quot; question, with the ability to link to a person as the introducer. It&#39;s a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-04-some-notes-from-a-lunchtime-talk-on-social-media/">Some notes from a lunchtime talk on social media</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few highlights, not the whole talk.</p>
<p>My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.</p>
<p>For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;followers&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</p>
<p>Regarding frequency, the notion is that communications media have a natural rhythm, and that you need to be aware of how often you post or comment so that you don&#39;t either overrun the medium or be so quiet as to be unnoticed.</p>
<p>Finally mobility is the observation that more and more people are coming to the net primarily through mobile devices and if you want to serve them you need to have a solution for your web and net presence that looks good on the small screen.</p>
<p>I was greeted with a fair degree of skepticism about the value of social media for business, especially from someone who cancelled his Facebook account and never has been on Twitter. There was good discussion of how hard it is to simultaneously be brand-conscious and be aware of a professional persona vs. sharing details of a personal life. I think it&#39;s harder for people in an agency role whose job it is to make the client look good but who don&#39;t have to have a personal public identity in order to do their work.</p>
<p>Some day when I retire I&#39;ll give up on social media entirely and just send postcards to people - they are novel compared to the communciations that people mostly get, they&#39;re quite portable and mobile, no one expects a frequency of a postcard more than once in a long while, and if you send postcards you&#39;re likely to get postcards in return.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.</p>
<p>I'm going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me.</p>
<p>1. Gmail is getting a new user interface, one that adds tabs and more integration with Google+. (<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">Gmail Blog</a>) "I know we feel the need to comment on everything right away these days, but honestly there isn't much to say about this feature until we've actually used it." (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787063">223 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. "The Drupal.org Security Team and Infrastructure Team has discovered unauthorized access to account information on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org." Users are advised to change their password, not to reuse passwords between sites, and to turn on two-factor authentication. 
(<a href="https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate">drupal.org</a>) 
"Malicious files were placed on association.drupal.org servers via a third-party application used by that site." - and commenters are wondering which third-party app was involved. 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788909">7 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. For $100/node/month, Linode announces a managed IT infrastructure. 
(<a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/05/29/introducing-linode-managed/">Linode</a>) 
"If the remote hands are awesome, this is well worth $100 per node. If they are anything but awesome, this wouldn't be worth it for any amount of money." 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788576">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>4. "The Magazine" has been sold by founder Marco Arment to editor Glenn Fleishman.
(<a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/29/sold-the-magazine">Marco Arment</a>)
Instapaper. Tumblr. and now The Magazine. Sounds like Marco is clearing house a bit.
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787079">57 comments</a>)</p>
<p>5. How to negotiate a job offer. "If you’re not currently working, and you don’t have competing offers, you’re pretty much out of luck."
(<a href="http://blog.upstart.com/2013/05/how-to-negotiate-job-offer.html">Upstart</a>)
"The "Pre-Reqs" piece is not right. You really don't need to have another job offer or a current job to negotiate. "
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787759">44 comments</a>)</p>
<p>6. Bill Gates is going to India because it has the grand challenge of extreme poverty and also the resources to attack that problem. He's also going to pick up some dance moves from a Bollywood star.
(<a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Topics/Development/Why-Im-Going-to-India">The Gates Notes</a>)
"Have you seen real poverty? Just take a trip to Mumbai and visit the slums there."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788874">25 comments</a>)</p>
<p>7. Amazon announces "Login with Amazon" as a single sign-on function for web sites.
(<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1824961&highlight=">Amazon PR</a>)
"I think this is a great idea. I don't love the Facebook OAuth flow and the amount of access most apps ask for."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5786554">69 comments</a>)</p>
<p>8. Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.

Of interest: Pixar raytracing, Liberty Reserve money laundering, and Harvard email snooping.</p>
<p>1. A breakdown of github pull requests by acceptance rate, for a variety of languages and projects. If you want to get your pull request accepted, don&#39;t write C++, write Scala; and contribute to projects like Akka&#0160;and&#0160;backbone-fundamentals that take 80+% of pull requests. (<a href="http://paulmillr.com/posts/github-pull-request-stats/" target="_self">Paul Miller</a>)&#0160;&quot;<span style="color: #000000;">I&#39;m surprised the acceptance rate is so high.&quot;</span> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5783616" target="_self">28 comments</a>)</p>

<p>3. &quot;Liberty Reserve, which was incorporated in 2006, was a &quot;bank of choice for the criminal underworld,&quot; according to the indictment, which said the operation allegedly laundered the money through 55 million transactions before it was shut down earlier this month.&quot; $6 billion was allegedly laundered.

      </h3>
      <p><p>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini. This comes together in a hurry - you can cook the whole thing up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Two or three cloves of garlic</li>
<li>Asparagus, about a pound</li>
<li>Button mushrooms, about a pound</li>
<li>Basil, dried or fresh</li>
<li>White wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<p>Boil water for pasta. When it&#39;s hot, cook the pasta. There should be time to drain it after you&#39;ve done the cooking of the asparagus.</p>
<p>Wash the asparagus, snap the tough ends, and slice on the bias into 1.5&quot; pieces. Clean the mushrooms and cut each one in half.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large frying pan on high. Fry the garlic until it&#39;s light brown and smells great.</p>
<p>Add the asparagus to the frying pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the asparagus is bright green. Add the mushrooms and keep stirring. When the mushrooms are hot, add the white wine, stir, and cover.</p>
<p>The recipe called for basil, but I didn&#39;t put it in because I was hurrying to get everything together.</p>
<p>The wine will deglaze the pan and make a nice sauce. Serve with pasta and white wine.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-28-kale-with-corn-and-green-onions/">Recipe: Kale with corn and green onions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>oil for frying</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>1 bag kale</li>
<li>corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better</li>
<li>green onions - chopped</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Wash and spin-dry the kale, being careful to get dirt out of the center rib. We had a very nice bag of small kale from market that didn&#39;t require much more than this, but if you have older, tougher kales, trim them of their tough bits and cut them into pieces.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large pot on medium high to high. Chop some garlic into big pieces. Fry the garlic until light brown and it smells good.</p>
<p>Add the kale and cook, stirring frequently, until the kale has cooked down to a fraction of its original size. Add some corn and the chopped green onions; stir. Cook until the corn is warmed through, then add some soy sauce and cover and turn down the heat to low.</p>
<p>One bag of kale served the family, with one person not eating it; there were a few leftovers. This recipe would multiply quite nicely.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">Yesterbox: answer yesterday&#39;s email, today</a>
      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://yesterbox.com" target="_self">Yesterbox</a> is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. In contrast, &quot;yesterbox&quot; gives you a finite number of messages to work through from yesterday, and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. There&#39;s no need to feel guilty, no need to feel like you&#39;re procrastinating, and no need to obsessively check today&#39;s messages. They can all be dealt with tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hseih estimates that it takes him three hours to plow through a day&#39;s messages, and he puts that time on his calendar in the morning to handle the previous day&#39;s correspondence. That&#39;s the world of a busy and successful CEO - you might well have a different time chunk that you&#39;d need to commit to, probably a lot less.</p>
<p>Emptying the inbox is a Sisyphean task. Yesterbox tries to make it a finite problem to handle. As a bonus, every conversation becomes a slow conversation, and there&#39;s a lot of routine unimportant detail in everyone&#39;s inbox that can be ignored once a day has gone past.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-on-summarization/">On summarization</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.</p>
<p>Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough. You might have to stitch together bits of several sentences to get one that describes the whole thing.</p>
<p>Summarization is active reading, and it improves recall. There&#39;s nothing quite like looking through a piece of text for its inner core to give you a real sense for what it&#39;s all about, and if you have to synthesize something new you recall that better than if you just hit the &quot;like&quot; button.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m skeptical of automated summarization, mostly because there seem to be enough people in the world interested in doing it by hand to make machine-aided cognition superfluous at least for popular articles. Machine reading works I suppose if you have so few eyes on the text that you have to crunch on it to make sense of it, but if there&#39;s an internet crowd to do that work the machine can simply tally human efforts instead of doing complicated automated text processing.</p>
<p>Hacker News is a challenging news stream to summarize because it turns over so quickly. In 12 hours or less, the top of the front page is fully new, and it&#39;s time to summarize again. I&#39;ve been doing it daily rather than 2x daily because the yield of interestingness just isn&#39;t there to call for more. There are other tech newsfeeds and newswires that are worth digesting, but not all of them are sufficiently different from Hacker News to provide a divergent task. For example, the top &quot;popular&quot; links on Pinboard overlap substantially with Hacker News, as does the front page of TechMeme.</p>
<p>Pinboard looks like it has the right kind of infrastructure to support summarization as a part of a workflow. The path would be to identify an interesting article, clip the good bit, hit &quot;pin&quot;, paste in the good bit, add a few tags, and save. To extract the useful stuff out you&#39;d run a report on the tag that you used that was unique to the category you were summarizing.</p>
<p>Summarization lends itself to pointless numbered bullshit (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2009/07/seven-things-i-want-to-remember-to-tell-you-about-blogging.html" target="_self">cf. #4 on this list</a>). Lots of articles are written with teaser headlines (5 best ways to do x) and can be unpacked by undoing the tease (The 5 best ways to do x are a, b, c, d, and e). You might take as your goal producing a summary that either dispenses with the need to read the original or that points the reader towards the best of what you have gone through and digested for them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.</p>
<p>I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. A useful bit of code would monitor the site, send off a batch of 10 articles to be summarized, and then wait checking periodically until those 10 have all fallen from favor to send out a new batch of 10.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>Compiled hastily, here&#39;s a summary of today&#39;s Hacker News top 10. Based solely on the top 10, it&#39;s a slow news day.</p>
<p>1. &quot;If you try to get several regular polygons to meet snugly at a point in the plane, what’s the most sides any of the polygons can have? The answer is 42.&quot; (<a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/42/" target="_self">Azimuth Project</a>) Some observations of mathematical questions for which the answer is 42 or a multiple thereof, in time for <a href="http://towelday.org/" target="_self">Towel Day</a>.</p>

He took the $300k bonus (<a href="http://boundary.com/blog/2013/05/26/i-took-the-300k/" target="_self">Cliff Moon</a>), a follow up to yesterday&#39;s account of someone who didn&#39;t (<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html" target="_self">Tom Preston-Warner</a>). It turned out well for both of them.</p>
<p>3. &quot;How far out is it possible to overhang blocks from the edge of a table without them toppling?&quot; The answer, surprisingly, is infinitely far. (<a href="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/may32013/index.html" target="_self">DataGenetics</a>)</p>
<div>4. Paypal has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. (<a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/163" target="_self">Robert Kugler, Full Disclosure</a>) Paypal pays bug bounties for people who find problems, but only to people over 18; the researcher who located this defect is a 17 yr old German student.</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. &quot;In 2012, under threat from fundamentalist rebels, a team of archivists, librarians, and couriers evacuated an irreplaceable trove of manuscripts from Timbuktu at great personal risk.&quot; Help save a library in exile, there&#39;s more work to be done.

<div>7.&#0160;Cameron D&#39;Ambrosio has been locked up&#0160;without bail for weeks &ndash; facing terrorism charges and 20 years in prison &ndash; all for something he posted on Facebook after the Boston Marathon bombing. (<a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/teenager/" target="_self">Fight For The Future</a>)</div>

<div>8. People who have enough savings to be unafraid of being fired are happier at work than those who depend on every paycheck (<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/30/weekend-edition-retire-in-your-mind-even-if-you-love-your-job/" target="_self">Mr. Money Moustache</a>)</div>
<div></div>
<div>9. Twitter is a big deal because &quot;it&#39;s a new messaging protocol, where you don&#39;t specify the recipients. New protocols are rare.&quot; (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/twitter.html" target="_self">Paul Graham</a>, 2009)</div>

<div>10. BetterPlace, a &quot;fat startup&quot; that tried to &quot;change the world&quot; about how people drive, has failed.

      <p>The top 10 stories on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_self">Hacker News</a> this instant, summarized quickly. It&#39;s taking me about 3 minutes per article to read and digest it well enough to write down a few words about it.</p>
<p>1. Poll: &quot;What is your hourly rate, or your monthly salary converted into hourly rate (divided by ~165 hours) in USD?&quot; (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5769348" target="_self">csomar</a>) Much discussion in the comments as to whether people are charging too little.</p>
<p>2. 98% of venture capitalists aren&#39;t dumb (<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/05/25/as-populist-as-it-may-feel-98-of-vcs-arent-dumb/" target="_self">Mark Suster</a>), a response to &quot;Dear Dumb VC&quot; (<a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/e17153fde5f1" target="_self">Andy Dunn</a>). Hot entrepreneur vs. VC action.</p>
<p>3. Google has dropped XMPP for federated chat in favor of its own chat protocols that don&#39;t interoperate, and an XMPP protocol standards engineer is not happy about it. (<a href="https://plus.google.com/116276248303121270590/posts/ggNwh9eLYWu" target="_self">Ralph Meijer</a>)</p>
<p>4. A $300,000 salary from Microsoft is not enough enticement, and Github&#39;s co-founder relates his leaving Microsoft in 2008 to start Github. (<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html?" target="_self">Tom Preston-Werner</a>)</p>
<p>5. Open plan offices are bad for worker health and productivity, and older workers especially hate the noise. (<a href="http://qz.com/85400/moving-to-open-plan-offices-makes-employees-less-productive-less-happy-and-more-likely-to-get-sick/#" target="_self">Quartz</a>)</p>
<p>6. &quot;This tutorial will teach you the main ideas of Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning.&quot; (<a href="http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial" target="_self">Stanford</a>) It&#39;s written in a wiki, and is available in both English and Chinese.</p>
<p>7. You need to know these HTML5 features: DNS prefetching, link prefetching, the download attribute, regular expressions for input santization, and the datalist element for autocomplete suggestions. (<a href="http://daker.me/2013/05/5-html5-features-you-need-to-know.html" target="_self">Adnane Belmadiaf</a>)</p>
<p>8. To transform the lives of poor individuals in Uganda, give people cash. They will use it to train themselves and their incomes will go up.

<p>9. Don&#39;t even consider programming in a language that allows you to have null pointer exceptions, and avoid languages that are dynamically typed. (<a href="http://sebastiansylvan.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/language-design-deal-breakers/" target="_self">Sebastian Sylvan</a>)</p>
<p>10. &quot;Different from line-based or character-based diff, ydiff is “language-based”. It parses the programs and then performs structural comparison on the parse trees.&quot; (<a href="http://yinwang0.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/ydiff/" target="_self">Yin Wang</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Jay Gatsby</strong>&#0160;is the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_role#Title_character" title="Title role">titular character</a>&#0160;of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>&#39;s 1925 novel&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>. The character has become an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">High society</a>&#0160;and the name has become synonymous with successful businessmen with shady pasts in the US.</p>
<h2>Character biography</h2>
<p>James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gatz, a bright young man from a poor family in North Dakota, despised the imprecations of poverty so much he dropped out of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Olaf_College" title="St. Olaf College">St. Olaf College</a>&#0160;in Minnesota after only a few weeks because of his shame at the janitorial job he had to take to pay his way. While training in 1917 to join the infantry and fight in&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>&#0160;he meets and promptly falls in love with the beautiful Daisy, who represents everything he is not: she is rich, from a patrician East Coast family and born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth. After the war, from which he emerged as a hero for his participation in the bloody battles of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Marne" title="Battle of the Marne">Marne</a>&#0160;and&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Argonne" title="Battle of Argonne">Argonne</a>, he attends&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford" title="Trinity College, Oxford">Trinity College</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>. While there he receives a letter from Daisy telling him she has married the equally aristocratic Tom Buchanan. Rather than admit defeat, he commits his life to becoming a man of the sort of wealth and stature he imagines could win her love.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gatz returned home to an America transformed by&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">prohibition</a>&#0160;in 1919, a period in American history in which gangsters earned the sort of vast wealth previously the domain of the connected upper classes, an era in which &quot;all the old boundaries that separated the classes were being broken, and a new wave of instant millionaires, like Gatsby himself&hellip; mingled with the polo-players who inhabited the stiff enclaves of the established rich of Long Island&#39;s gold coast.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&#0160;This era later came to be known as the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age" title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</a>, after Fitzgerald&#39;s own coinage.</p>
<p>Gatz, who renamed himself Jay Gatsby, made a fortune in bootlegging thanks to his association with gangsters like Meyer Wolfsheim (patterned after real-life American gangster&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rothstein" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a>) and sets himself up in a mansion in the fictional West Egg, Long Island, a haunt of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux_riche" title="Nouveaux riche">nouveaux riche</a>&#0160;and across from the old-line money East Egg, where Tom and Daisy Buchanan live. Gatsby hosts wild parties, open to all comers, there every weekend, in the hopes that Daisy will attend and he can win her heart. He eventually catches up with Daisy, but fails to convince her to leave Tom. After his failure to change Daisy&#39;s mind is clear to all but him, Daisy drives Gatsby&#39;s car with Gatsby in the passenger seat and she accidentally strikes and kills Myrtle, the lover of her husband Tom, in a hit-and-run accident. Myrtle&#39;s jealous husband George tracks the car back to the Buchanan home, where Tom lies and tells him that Gatsby was the driver of the car that killed his wife. George goes to Gatsby&#39;s house, finds him floating in his lavish pool, and murders him before taking his own life. Almost none of Gatsby&#39;s high society friends attend his funeral and in the meantime Gatsby&#39;s underworld connections begin picking through his belongings in his mansion.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Gatsby as a reference point</h2>
<p>The figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America.&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mathews" title="Chris Mathews">Chris Mathews</a>&#0160;in his book&#0160;<em>American</em>&#0160;even forgives Gatsby his serial lies. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy&#39;s, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because &quot;all my ancestors have been educated there&quot; Mathews sees him as the eternal American striver. &quot;Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had&#0160;<em>always</em>&#0160;had it&hellip; this blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy&#39;s specifications is the heart and soul of the&#0160;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>. It&#39;s the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>&quot;Jay Gatsby&hellip; appears to be the quintessential American male hero. He is a powerful businessman with shady connections, drives a glamorous car&hellip; and pursues the beautiful, privileged Daisy,&quot; Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson write.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;In the Handbook of American Folklore, Richard Dorson sees Gatsby as a new American archetype who made a decision to transform himself after his first chance encounter with his mentor Dan Cody, who opens the door to riches in boot-legging. &quot;The ragged youth who some months later (after Gatsby drops out of St. Olaf) introduces himself to a degenerate yachtsman as Jay Gatsby has explicitly rejected the Protestant ethic&hellip; in favor of a much more extravagant form of ambition.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Referring to real life figures as&#0160;<em>Gatsby</em>&#0160;has been common in the United States, usually in reference to rich men whose rise to prominence involved an element of deception. In a story on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Foster_Winans" title="R. Foster Winans">R. Foster Winans</a>, a reporter for the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>&#39;s&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column who was fired after it was discovered he was giving advance knowledge of the columns&#39; contents to Peter Brant, the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post_Intelligencer" title="Seattle Post Intelligencer">Seattle Post Intelligencer</a>&#0160;described Brant as &quot;Winan&#39;s Gatsby.&quot; The article noted that Brant had changed his name from Bornstein and said he was &quot;a man who turned his back on his heritage and his family because he felt that being recognized as Jewish would be a detriment to his career.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&#0160;The&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column often effects the prices of the stocks it mentions.</p>
<p>The character is often used as a symbol of great wealth.

      <p>An attempt to catch the top news of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_self">Hacker News</a> on a Friday evening and summarize the top 10 stories; I won&#39;t make any decisions about what should be in the top 10, just note them here with a summary. It took me about 30 minutes to summarize 10 stories, without being selective about which ones were important.</p>
<p>1. Ben Howdle is &quot;Too scared to write a line of code&quot; (<a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/eef96ea6f4cb?imm_mid=0a9102&amp;cmp=em-velocity-newsletters-vl-save20-20130523-direct" target="_self">Medium</a>). This reminds me of the Donald Knuth quote, &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;.</p>
<p>2. Yahoo has &quot;submitted a bid for the video site&quot; Hulu (<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130524/yet-another-hulu-bidder-yahoo-is-in-too/" target="_self">All Things D</a>). They&#39;re not the only ones bidding, with Directv, Time Warner Cable, and several others in the running.&#0160;</p>

<p>5. &quot;If you already have a strong passphrase on your SSH private key, then converting it from the traditional private key format to PKCS#8 is roughly comparable to adding two extra keystrokes to your passphrase, for free.&quot; (<a href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html" target="_self">Martin Kleppmann</a>) Bonus: it&#39;s only four lines of shell to do this and verify that it works.</p>
<p>6. Plan 9 has some very tightly written, very strange C code; &quot;it’s not every day that you come across code that makes you feel funny because of its unusual syntactic structure&quot; (<a href="http://computationallyendowed.com/blog/2012/12/03/ifs-and-ands-and-plan-9s-source-code.html" rel="author" target="_self">Spiros Eliopoulos</a>).

<p>The I-5 Skagit River Bridge is a through-truss bridge that was built in 1955, according to the website Bridgehunter.com. It is the same basic type of design of the Interstate 5 Bridge over the Columbia River in Vancouver, according to the site.</p>
