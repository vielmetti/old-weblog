<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too.</p>

<p>Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don't have enough oomph to take on an Internet's worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet.</p>

<p>If I were looking at standards and formats I would look at traditional Internet protocols and formats (HTTP, JSON), at older serial data networks (like RS-232 or even MODBUS), and I'd get a grasp on how you might communicate over radio networks like the 915 Mhz ISM band or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). I'd also look at publish/subscribe systems like MQTT, and lightweight data retrieval systems like COAP, and I'd be aware of all of the things you might do over a simple TCP connection. And then I'd look at the security of all of this (and weep, sometimes, because it's not easy.)</p>

<p>The internet of things world hasn't condensed into a single system, and because of its origins it's unlikely to do so. Picking which of three or four possible solutions could work for your application - one of which might be HTTP - is good. Deciding which fits the right sweet spot of skills, costs, and time to deploy is another good way to think about it.</p>

      <p>The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit by severe storms the evening of October 2, 2014. The <a href="http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/10/as-north-texas-experiences-exceptional-drought-for-first-time-since-2011-rain-and-cooler-temperatures-expected-today.html/">Dallas Morning News live blog</a> details the impact, with more than 250,000 people without power.</p>

<p>This outage map from about 7:00 p.m. that evening shows the extent of the damage.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c6ec75d0970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c6ec75d0970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-02 at 7.16.00 PM" title="Screen Shot 2014-10-02 at 7.16.00 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c6ec75d0970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>My power outage tracker page is a good early warning of problems with the power grid. By looking at what web pages people are clicking through on, I can see where the troubles are. The <a href="http://stormcenter.oncor.com/default.html">Oncor Storm Center</a> page was what people were focusing on, so I took a look. Oncor's map is built by iFactor, which does maps for a lot of utility companies. Alas the most useful view for a big storm - outages by zip code - is hidden under a menu, but once you find it you can get a nice colorful overview of where things are the worst.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">first wrote up the experience</a> I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/11/octodroid-is-a-github-client-for-android.html">Octodroid</a> as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: left;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d img-responsive" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-03 at 9.38.40 AM" title="Screen Shot 2014-10-03 at 9.38.40 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>

<p>The new thing in my life (to go with the new laptop) is <a href="http://www.neat.io/bee/">Bee</a> (@thebeeapp), a Mac native client that's a front end for several issue tracking systems. I have a free 30 day trial, after which the software looks like it could be reasonably priced if I were to use it all the time. Notably it's software-as-software, not software-as-a-service, so I'd just buy it and not have to pay every month for it.</p>

<p>Bee gives you a nice GUI for your issues, so that you can sift through the debris of what you thought you wanted to do and comment on, reassign, close, or edit those things. The net effect for me over a few hours of use was to flush out about two dozen things that had been obscured by my previous issue management regime that I was never going to do or that were totally overtaken by events. </p>

<p>The "getting things done" ritual speaks of a weekly review, where you once a week sort through all of the detritus that had landed on your todo list over the course of a week and make sense of it all. The ability to take on a review like that depends crucially on whether you can get everything that's on your plate into a single list that you can walk through methodically (and in some sensible order) so that you're not horribly fatigued by issue overload by the end. Perhaps it's the new app smell that makes it possible for me to do that anew, but I was really happy with Bee as a way to work through a review, and I'm hopeful that it keeps giving me insights and inspiration as time goes on.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Answers to questions sent to Greg McDonald, CTN manager, regarding closed captioning at on City of Ann Arbor's Community Television Network.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you providing closed captioning?</strong></p>

<p>The Commission on Disability Issues made a request to add captions to their meetings to increase meeting accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Who is providing the closed captioning for CTN?</strong></p>

<p>ScreenLine, L.L.C.</p>

<p><strong>How much is the size of the contract, and for how long does it run?</strong></p>

<p>We do not have a contract with the company, we’re in a trial period and they’ll be invoicing us each time we use their service.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the individuals who are doing the closed captioning based? Are they on-site, or off-site?</strong></p>

<p>Off-site, based in Grand Ledge, Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>When was the decision made to add closed captioning to the Disability Commission?</strong></p>

<p>The Disability Commission request for closed caption services was approved as part of the FY2015 budget discussion at the Feb. 25, 2014 Cable Commission meeting.  </p>

<p><strong>Are there considerations of adding closed captioning for City Council meetings?</strong></p>

<p>Funding would have to be identified in order for closed captioning services to be provided for City Council or other Board and Commission meetings cablecast by CTN.  </p>

<p><strong>What has changed about the technology to make closed captioning feasible now when it wasn't before?</strong></p>

<p>The technology/equipment has improved and is a little less expensive today than when last researched in 2008. The closed caption service costs are about the same. The May 27, 2014 Cable Commission meeting includes (about 6:30 minute mark) discussion about the service and equipment  <a href="http://a2govtv.pegcentral.com/player.php?video=507268f61855facce4fbff749ad0ad94">video</a></p>

<p><strong>Are the transcripts from the closed captioning available as well?</strong></p>

<p>We have no transcripts from the closed captions.</p>

<p><strong>One last question: what does one hour of closed-captioned video cost, under your current arrangement with Screenline? Is there a list price, and did we get a discount? I listened to the Cable Commission discussion you linked to (thanks for that) but was no wiser as to the hourly rate from that discussion.</strong></p>

<p>The cost is $100/hr and each meeting will require a minimum of 1hr of set-up/prep time but that could vary/increase depending upon the agenda.  As far as I know, we have not been given a discount, however ScreenLine has been very helpful as we were getting the technical part of the system set-up and did not charge us for any of their time during that.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><strong>Editorial debt</strong> accumulates when the passage of time makes a document
less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited
to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.</p>

<p>For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many
ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps
in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which
can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself
out. A proper self-contained story will be true in its time, even
if the story so far is incomplete.</p>

<p>For slow-moving stories that you want to keep accurate over time,
you write things that pretend to be timeless but that are no longer
true. Details too small to warrant a complete rewrite of the narrative
are now wrong, and the text needs minor but significant edits to
reflect current reality.</p>

<p>A similar concept is bit-rot, the notion that software degrades
over time and no longer works as well as when it was released.
That can occur as a result of changes in the operating system,
changes in the working environment, adaptations by users and
appropriation of features that were not completely thought through,
or just changes in fashion.</p>

<p>How to mark things that are signs of editorial debt to come?
Words like "now" are dangerous, or "currently"; the page does
not know when that time is past. It would be better to explicitly date the
elements that are tied to time, so that you can instead say
"in October 2014", which will always be true even if circumstances 
change later.</p>

<p>What results can be a patchwork of text that tries to be
universal but that always looks dated. Balancing the narrative
with "it used to be this way but now it's this way" versus
deleting the old obsolete text and just starting fresh, now
there's a challenge.</p>

<p>Wiki is really bad for accumulating editorial debt. Text written
in an encyclopedic style really wants to be true, and not just
a snapshot in time of one of many possible states along the
evolution of an idea. Consider a timeline as an editorial structure
that puts the age of the idea primary in the narrative, so that
it's clear when the idea that you had needs to be revisited.</p>

<p>Compare with "technical debt", used to describe code that needs to
be cleaned up that drags down progress.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750wordscom-a-writing-environment-for-a-daily-writing-exercise.html" target="_self">750 word essay</a> every day.</p>
<p>I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone. The morning ritual of daily coffee and wifi usually produces something publishable, though often it&#39;s much shorter. You might only clip and save and share a single tweet&#39;s worth of someone else&#39;s work and call that a success to capture the idea of the moment.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t sit down and write all the time, though. There&#39;s meetings to go to, code to struggle with, people to see, places to go, dinner to cook, and the endless slog of Internet to wade through. When I do have a chance to write to produce things, it&#39;s often 50 words there, 10 words here, a click of a button there. It&#39;s not always long, extended efforts.</p>
<p>The long, extended efforts are fun, don&#39;t get me wrong, and they really focus the mind and help me think about topics for much longer than I would otherwise. The ideal writing environment gets all of the distractions out of the way and shuts out the beep-beep-beep of interrupts that otherwise drive my efforts. Getting away from interrupts turns out to be really hard work, and obtaining an uninterrupted stretch that allows such a focus is a rare treat.</p>
<p>What would you focus on if you had 750 words of uninterrupted focus every day? It should be enough to dig deep into a topic, not just to hit the surface but to wallow around in it, trying out lots of options.</p>
<p>I&#39;m cutting this self-reflective essay off at about 300 words, because there are 450 words that I&#39;d rather apply to something else.</p>

<p>If u/c &gt; 0.8 the structure is congested; at u/c &gt; 0.9 the structure is full. That reduces the time series of usage for a given structure into one of three values (green, yellow, red). Some public policy goal wants to keep the structures congested (to maximize revenues) but not full (to minimize complaints).</p>
<p>Given a series of values over a range of time, you want to summarize those numbers. Do you pick the worst value (&quot;we were temporarily full&quot;), the average value, the mean value? Some decision needs to be made. If you have frequent measurements you could conceivably show this as a continuous series with lots of data points.</p>

      <p>How do you organize materials such that they don't get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it's hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world.</p>

<p>I'm noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I'd have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year. It's simply not going to happen! Ditto in spades the wiki-conundrum, the more you have in your wiki the more likely it is to be outdated.</p>

<p>Perhaps the answer is to invert the problem. What do you do to make the world keep up with you? Is it easy for someone to see what you want them to see, or is your external presentation confusing? I'll note that it's easy for people to determine that I have some interest in power outages, though that's hardly the focus of my life these days.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I won't be complaining about a small keyboard or a small screen for a while, but I have a lot of tools to reinstall on a new system.</p>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<p>Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there's a working full-screen mode.</p>

<p>git comes with the machine, so I didn't have to install it; it's a big part of making sure that stuff gets version tracked.</p>

<p>Node-RED. I need to have a simple programming environment that is network and device aware, and for the past few months Node-RED has been it. I'm at version 0.9.0 now. That depends first on having node.js installed, and subsequently on pulling in a lot of Node-RED dependencies.</p>

<p>Contacts. I've synced Google Contacts with the Apple address book; that took an extra step since I'm using 2-factor authentication at Google. The CardDAV support is new to me.</p>

<p>Dropbox. Plug it in, it just works. Next.</p>

<p>Google Drive. Plug it in, it seems to work; lots to sync including a lot of photos and a lot of unsorted old crap.</p>

<p>One of the things I'm realizing is that yes, there's lots of "unsorted old crap" on this which is still a new machine. </p>

<p>XCode, that's a mighty big download.</p>

<p>Apple Software Update is patching the shellshock vulnerability, I hope.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Github is not much fun on a very small screen.</p>

<p>Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn't so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone.</p>

<p>None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki.</p>

<p>Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process. Short of getting a bigger screen, I don't see any way to support that kind of flow on a small device.</p>

<p>I simply do not see enough on this little device screen to make it useful for assisting decision making about what to do next. While an omnipresent device is ideal for instant response to the top of the inbox, it is really limiting for handling overflow situations.</p>

<p>If I had to stick to the small screen indefinitely I would cancel some projects that are just too frustrating to keep up with. Surprisingly, blogging would stay. Pushing out commentary in an unlinked one way scroll only demands a modest typing skill and has only a minimum need for structure. </p>

      <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived.</p>

<p>Libraries have traditionally clipped obits in the service of local historians and genealogists to help the info seeker. From time to time I have posted or reprinted obits here, and Arborwiki collects them as well, unevenly but diligently.</p>

<p>What would you have if your collection had every obituary printed for a city, carefully indexed and cross referenced? The big challenge I can imagine is disambiguation, making sure that you can tell the many people apart who share a name and a home town. </p>

      <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.</p>

<p>For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. So even though I am not keeping up with private discourse, my public engagement with the tiny part of the net that reads blogs is going just fine.</p>

<p>The strong temptation is to head to the Apple store and buy something fast, fancy, shiny, waterproof, coffee proof, and with a solid keyboard. I don't know if that device exists. Until then the cup of coffee always goes to the far right of the small screen so I know where it is at all times and so I don't knock it over again.</p>

      <p>Pete Kaminski pointed me to <a href="http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">this essay on archetypes in computer gaming</a>, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.</p>

<p>What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. It is not enough to win friends by your personal charm in this world; instead you write the Bayesian classifier that guides your behavior scientifically towards friend maximization. Whatever can be automated will be automated, and the rest of human behavior analyzed to give clues for further automation.</p>

<p>Lots of online games lend themselves to machines assisting or even taking over. People who have substantial bot writing skills have an undue influence on the culture of online networks and games for the few humans who stick around unarmed to watch the fray up close. What better way to while away the hours online than by tending to your collection of bots that prompt, provoke, or guide the behavior of other humans (or other bots).</p>

      <p>The tone of Michigan football blogs has changed since the loss to Minnesota on Saturday. Before the game there was a lot of grumbling, but it was varied; no one single issue stood out. After the game, it was much more clear.</p>

<p>A series of plays saw the second string Michigan quarterback, Shane Morris, get hit hard on his head. Morris is seen exhibiting signs of a concussion. Yet in an unfortunate sequence he goes back into the game after sitting out one play on the sidelines.</p>

<p>Fans now have a pinpoint spot to point their anger at coach Brady Hoke. The team lost, but it's not all about winning and losing. What matters now is the understanding of the coaching staff and their inability to protect an obviously injured student from further harm.</p>

<p>Michigan has gotten funding to reduce the risk of concussions in sports. It appears that all that effort was for naught in this particular instance of not protecting a player whose judgment was impaired because of a head injury. Coach Hoke is under fire and for good reason.</p>

      <p>The revolution will not be blogged. It will be twittered or facebooked or elloed or plurked, but blogging is not a revolutionary activity in the new era of the net.</p>

<p>The process of writing for your own web site and then announcing that you have something new to say to the world is perhaps the least efficient way of getting news to the world. It is so much easier and more efficient to drop that news inside a walled garden of publishing and have it ricochet quickly inside the walls.</p>

<p>If blogging is old school, and slow and cumbersome, then why bother? I can only point to the benefits of having at least the illusion of control over your own words. The instant message instantly delivered inside the AOL chat room or Facebook page or you name your walled garden of choice gets to where it's going fast, but once it's off the screen it's gone. Blogging at least gives you the hope that if you wanted to see something from 10 years ago that it would still be there. </p>

<p>Enduring is a virtue that lends itself to systems that sometimes are more cumbersome for their long use. I am reasonably sure that I will be able to locate this post in 5 or 15 years, even if the nature of publishing on blogs means only a few people will read it the same day it was written.</p>

      <p>At some point in the life of a project it is inevitable that an obstacle comes up that makes you wonder whether your enthusiasm for the effort is well placed.</p>

<p>Do you redouble your efforts, or do you take a break, or do you simply refocus and find something else to zero in on for the moment?</p>

<p>Sometimes a bit of distance can help, at least temporarily. Rather than exit in flames with a tattered manifesto flapping on the door in your wake, just go quiet for a while. If no one notices that you are no longer present so much, then you can free up that unrequited love and apply it to something else for a while.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify
the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing
like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items
that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the
time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once,
and it stuck.</p>

<p>A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do
in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on. I
use github issues to track my big pile of things to do, and alas
it does not have a random() function. Fortunately though there is
a Github API, and that combined with <code>jq</code> and my <code>randomline</code> script
are enough to approximate that.</p>

<p>A third very reasonable approach is to ask someone what they would
like you to do; or even better yet anticipate what they would ask
and do it before they ask.</p>

<p>That reminds me, I have work to do.</p>
