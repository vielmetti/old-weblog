    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I checked out a 27 watt solar panel with a very beefy battery from the Ann Arbor District Library. The battery also charges via a wall wart, and provides either 5V USB power or switchable 10V-19V DC. I've been thinking about getting a solar panel, and my conclusion is that 27 watts is overkill for my normal use case which is powering my phone. The battery was awesome, but again overkill - too heavy to be an everyday carry. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-14-solar-panel-batteries-available-for-checkout-at-ann-arbor-district-library/">&raquo;</a></p>

It's interesting and fun to try to write a weblog when you don't have any content management system other than the Unix shell, but at some point quickly you end up moving a file on top of another file and wiping out a bunch of work, and then it gets less fun.
What I think I want to do there is write in Markdown, but somehow assemble bits of Markdown into what ends up looking like an old fashioned blog, with a sidebar that's interesting and ever-changing and a main blog part that's one post per day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-11-theres-a-reason-i-embraced-blogging-tools-as-soon-as-i-found-them/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Throwing out some notes here for a panel I'm on at the #micities conference at the Michigan Union today October 4, 2014.
The questions are around open data, considered as data published by a government agency that has a
 well defined data format (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML documented API, etc) well defined access path via Internet (HTTP, FTP, API) well defined terms of use and reuse  Census data is perhaps the most openly open of open data. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-04-some-notes-on-open-data-for-micities/">&raquo;</a></p>

Where would you go in the Loop to get good and interesting cards? I'm not interested in spending lots of money per card, but I would like to have a nice variety to choose from. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-im-heading-to-chicago-ill-be-near-the-loop-where-should-i-buy-postcards/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too.
Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don't have enough oomph to take on an Internet's worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-internet-of-things-world-hasnt-condensed-into-a-single-system-and-because-of-its-origins-its-unl/">&raquo;</a></p>

This outage map from about 7:00 p.m. that evening shows the extent of the damage.

My power outage tracker page is a good early warning of problems with the power grid.

        <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-bee-app-a-multiplatform-issue-tracker-client-for-mac/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Editorial debt accumulates when the passage of time makes a document less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.
For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-accumulating-editorial-debt-and-dealing-with-out-of-date-text/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a 750 word essay every day.
I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-do-you-still-write-750-words-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>
