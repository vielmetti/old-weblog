At some point you get to the state where there's one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-01-inbox-zero-just-means-that-i-have-filled-up-the-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

 CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.
 The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio's programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like Radio Reference and RepeaterBook to find the channels you want to have easy access to. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-24-programming-your-new-radio-with-chirp/">&raquo;</a></p>

What has changed that would drive the price from $140 to $800? The only simple answer (right or wrong) is China. The South China Morning Post reports -

 We, the undersigned faculty of the University of Michigan, support your intent to realign administrative expenses relative to revenues. However we collectively reject the proposed Administrative Services Transformation (AST) project. We respectfully offer an alternative approach to AST, which we call Unit- Centric Services (UCS).

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I saw this today at the poster wall near the Fishbowl on the University of Michigan central campus. The #BBUM hashtag has been trending for a couple of days now.

The CSS is
 a:link { color: #c00 } /* unvisited links */ a:visited { color: #0c0 } /* visited links */ a:hover { color: #00c } /* user hovers */ a:active { color: #ccc } /* active links */  I'm sure it could be better or different; indeed, that style didn't last long before I went to more typical blue for link text and purple for visited links. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-20-technicolor-link-text/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.
What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that's visibly not the only issue at hand.

        <p>I went with S and J to the University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to David S. Carter (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.
There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/">&raquo;</a></p>
