<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press (<a href="http://www.rcfp.org">RCFP</a>) announced a new FOIA generator and FOIA request tracker, "iFOIA", at the ONA '13 conference. From their <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-committee-launches-ifoia-electronic-information-request-filing-and-tracking-system">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iFOIA resource, which is online at <a href="http://www.ifoia.org">www.ifoia.org</a>, is an extension of the Reporters Committee’s popular FOIA Letter Generator, which has been a feature of the organization’s website since 1996. iFOIA can be used on a desktop or mobile device, and allows users to choose whether to keep their correspondence chains with government agencies confidential or share them with designated colleagues, such as editors and lawyers. It also includes a FOIA Wiki for feedback and discussions. Because it automatically organizes all of a reporter’s files, it is designed to help with lawsuits and agency appeals when government stonewalling presents no other option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sent my first request in this morning, a straightforward one that shouldn't require any payment or any appeal, and I'm hopeful that it will work as easily as it seems to work. The site is in beta.</p>

<p>The other FOIA request system to compare it with is the now-venerable <a href="http://www.muckrock.com">Muckrock</a>, which does a similar task. The biggest visible difference with Muckrock is that the iFOIA site doesn't appear to have a one-step straightforward way to share your FOIA request and results with the world. Muckrock serves as both a request and publication platform, and seems to be tuned to publicity and activism; the RCFP system looks like it's designed more for the journalist keeping their work private until it shows up in print.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's more like "inbox three" than "inbox zero" because of a couple of persistent stuck messages, and the todo list is full of items that I put on it ten months ago that still need to be done. That said, I'm still happy with my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">issuetracker system</a>, for which I'm using <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">Github's issues system</a> as a personal productivity tool. It has a long memory, it's reliable, and the mobile tools for managing lists work nicely on my Android phone.</p>

<p>The one thing I'm not completely happy with is how to make sure that things that need to get done every week are done promptly on time. My calendar is not quite a strong enough reminder, and it's not sane to do a todo item every single week for routine events. For daily medication reminders, I've found that <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">Medhelper</a> is single-focused and detailed enough to work well.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/11/addtodo_a_simpl.html">todo list code</a> I released to the net was back in 2005, and it had the feature of being completely manageable from the command line and capable of generating a random task. It looks like it's possible that I could install <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub">ingy's git-hub tool</a> and have things work that way again.</p>

  <p>Affinia Group Inc., a firm that designs, manufactures, distributes and markets industrial grade products and services, will relocate its Ann Arbor, Mich., headquarters to Gastonia, home of its Global Filtration group.
  The transition to the new corporate headquarters will occur in phases during 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia gives a little background</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Affinia Group, a motor industry company, was formed in 2004 and specializes in the design, manufacture and replacement of parts for and on and off-road vehicles. Specifically filtration and chassis components.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Affinia has approximately 50 jobs at its current headquarters, but that doesn’t mean all those jobs will relocate here. “We’re still putting together the transition plan,” said Keith Wilson, president of WIX Global Filtration. “It’s more of a consolidation than it is a big addition of people.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/outside_the_loop/2013/10/affinia-group-to-move-headquarters-to.html">Charlotte Business Journal</a> points to a new CFO at Affinia as an impetus for the move:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It all started in December, when Affinia spun off its brakes unit that makes Raybestos brand of automobile brakes. That unit, called <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brake-parts-inc-is-back-199857601.html">Brake Parts Inc.</a>, was sold to members of Affinia’s brakes unit management team. The price of the deal for Brake Parts, which contributed one-third of Affinia’s sales in 2011, wasn’t disclosed. Then on Monday, Affinia announced it had hired a Charlotte executive, Steve Klueg, as its new chief financial officer. Klueg, CFO at ReCommunity Recycling in Charlotte, will stay in the Charlotte area after he replaces Thomas Madden at Affinia, Howat says.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Tom Madden has almost 40 years of financial leadership to our company, and his guidance has been an immeasurable ingredient in helping us achieve our status as a worldwide leader," said Terry McCormack, president and CEO of Affinia Group. "In a continuing demonstration of the commitment he has shown throughout his career, Tom will work side by side with our incoming CFO Steve Klueg to seamlessly transfer financial leadership over the coming months."</p>

<h2>DTE Energy addresses temporary lighting failure at Comerica Park</h2>

<p>DETROIT, Oct. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy's preliminary investigation of the temporary lighting failure that occurred at Comerica Park during Major League Baseball's American League Championship Series (ALCS), has found there was a cable failure in the area near the stadium, which caused the problem.</p>

<p>The lights in the stadium were out for approximately 20 minutes beginning at approximately 4:41 p.m. Power was restored in the stadium at around 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The cable failure caused a voltage reduction, which tripped the lights in the stadium. The momentary sag in voltage was an isolated incident.</p>

<p>DTE Energy maintains two independent electrical feeds for precisely this kind of an event. Both feeds to the park continued to provide power during the incident.</p>

<p>"We've identified the cause of the disturbance and we worked with officials at Comerica Park to resolve the issue quickly," said Steve Kurmas, President and Chief Operating Officer for DTE Electric, a unit of DTE Energy. "We regret the interruption."</p>

<p>DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Its operating units include an electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan and a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church of San Pedro in Loboc is the second oldest church in Bohol. It was originally built in 1602, but soon reduced to ashes. In 1638, a stronger one was built. Located near the river, it has survived a number of floods. Inside the church, you can admire some remarkable naive paintings on the ceiling. A Spanish coat of arms can be found in the stone wall near the entrance of the convent. The bell tower of Loboc is about 100 meters from the church.</p>

  <p>Update:   Xerox Resolves EBT System Outage.
  Beneficiary access to programs such as SNAP, TANF, and other programs has been restored to the 17 States where Xerox provides EBT service.  Re-starting the EBT system required time to ensure service was back at full functionality.  Beneficiaries who required immediate access to their benefits could work with their local merchants who could activate an emergency voucher process where available. We appreciate our clients’ patience while we resolved this issue and apologize for any inconvenience. We realize that access to these benefits is important to families in the states we serve. We continue to investigate the cause of the issue so we can take steps to ensure a similar interruption does not re-occur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a routine test of our back-up systems Saturday morning,  Xerox’s Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system experienced a temporary shutdown. While the system is now up and running, beneficiaries in the 17 affected states continue to experience connectivity issues to access their benefits. This disruption impacts EBT beneficiaries who rely on the system for SNAP and WIC. Technical staff is addressing the issue and expect the system to be restored soon.  Beneficiaries requiring access to their benefits can work with their local retailers who can activate an emergency voucher system where available. We appreciate our clients’ patience while we work through this outage as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Sheree Powell, Director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, also told NBC10 affiliate KFOR that the system failure is the result of a power outage at a Xerox facility. EBT cards in several states are powered by a company that Xerox owns called ACS, Inc.
  "We are getting updated in real time," said <a href="http://news.xerox.com/contacts">Karen Arena</a>, a spokeswoman for Xerox. "But as far as I know right now some of the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system is experiencing temporary connectivity issues.

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia Bryan, public information officer for the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the problems stemmed from a power outage at the main data center for Xerox, the vendor for EBT cards in Mississippi and 16 other states across the nation. The outage caused equipment problems that led to cards being declined at stores across the state. Bryan said Xerox reported that the issue should be resolved shortly, but no specific time frame was available. "This has nothing to do with the federal government shutdown," Bryan said.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/a2trees.html">a2trees</a> app provides some kind of on-the-go listing of street trees in Ann Arbor that are interesting. The observation that there is a great apple crop in 2013 and that there are city trees laden with nice apples just waiting to be picked was the motivation. It's really bare-bones now, with not more more in the way of detail than my old <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/07/amelanchier-shadbush-juneberry-sugar-plum-inventory-for-ann-arbor-2009.html">juneberry listing</a> post, except neatly set up for mobile use.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/index.html">mobile web</a> app is self-referential in that it tries to collect useful bookmarks to mobile-ready versions of things like newspaper, bus, weather, netnews, and other web pages specially formatted for mobile use. I got tired of typing in the URL to fetch the bus listing so I put it on a menu. This is an up-to-dated version of the list I kept of <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~emv/m/">mobile sites on monkey.org</a> dating back about 5 years from when I had a Blackberry and was collecting same. The project is <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">up on Github</a> (and has been for the past 5 years!) but there's not much more to look at than data. Please do feel free to give me feedback there as well as here.</p>

<p>Finally two power outage related mobile sites. The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index.html">mobile power outage maps</a> collection is a slow but sure approach to turning my popular <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> blog post into something more tidy for the small screen. The state it's in is functional but not complete, and I expect I'll chip away at it as storms or outages warrant. A second and new app for me is a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index-ziplookup.html">utility company finder</a> site that takes as its input the first three digits of a zip code and returns the utility companies that serve that area, or type the utility name and get back a list of 3-digit zips it serves. The big caveats on this are that it's slow, slow, slow, and that the data set it's derived from is nominally from 2011 but shows many signs of not being kept up to date with utility mergers and name changes since then.</p>

<p>All of these "mobile" things are browser-based right now, so you can try them from whatever system you are likely to be typing at. They use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> for the fancy bits, and I'm pretty happy so far in just how far I get with that system using HTML do to the work and not having to write a bunch of Javascript to get things to work. On the server side I have been generating these as static sites using old-fashioned Unix shell scripts and makefiles, and though it's not elegant by any means, it is well within exactly the kind of coding environment I've been using since the 1980s.</p>

<p>Let's start with the lead of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/08/230486409/amidst-big-salmonella-outbreak-usda-says-it-s-on-the-job?sc=tw&amp;cc=share">NPR story</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a health alert warning that an estimated 278 illnesses caused by Salmonella Heidelberg are associated with raw chicken produced by Foster Farms at three facilities in California.</p>
  
  <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says illnesses have been reported in 17 states, with the vast majority — 78 percent — in California. The outbreak is ongoing, so it's possible that people are still being sickened by the chicken.</p>
  
  <p>The CDC says about 42 percent of the people who've gotten sick (among those for whom information is available) have been hospitalized. The strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that have made people sick are resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. And according to the CDC, the resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or make the illness tougher to treat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This public health alert is being issued after an estimated 278 illnesses were recently reported in 18 states, predominantly in California.  The outbreak is continuing. The investigations indicate that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken and other brand chicken produced at Foster Farms plants are the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg infections. Illnesses were linked to Foster Farms brand chicken through epidemiologic, laboratory and traceback investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS continues its investigation.</p>

<p>and from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html">CDC's MMWR report</a>, a case count and map -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of October 7, 2013, a total of 278 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella Heidelberg have been reported from 17 states. Most of the ill persons (77%) have been reported from California. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (2), Arkansas (1), Arizona (11), California (213), Colorado (4), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (2), Michigan (2), North Carolina (1), Nevada (8), Oregon (8), Texas (5), Utah (2), Washington (15) and Wisconsin (1).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/270175/2/Salmonella-outbreak-in-18-states-including-Michigan">WZZM / USA Today</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CDC has been hampered in tracing the outbreak because the government shutdown meant the agency had to shut down PulseNet, a national network of public health laboratories that looks for trends and matches reports to spot food-borne illness outbreaks. It's one of the agency's most important tools in detecting such problems.</p>
  
  <p>"We were trying to do this without the automatic system, and it was nearly impossible," Reynolds said. Seven of the eight staffers who run the system were furloughed. "We were doing it by hand, and it just become untenable."</p>
  
  <p>CDC director Thomas Frieden determined that not having PulseNet was resulting in "an imminent threat to health and safety," a finding that allowed the agency to bring back the seven staffers, Reynolds said Tuesday. "It's back up and running as of today."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/">PulseNet</a> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PulseNet compares the 'DNA fingerprints' of bacteria from patients to find clusters of disease that might represent unrecognized outbreaks. Health officials can't stop an outbreak, and industry and regulatory agencies can't make changes to our food and water delivery systems, if they don't know that outbreaks are occurring. That's where PulseNet comes in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does <a href="http://fosterfarms.com/faq/faqfoodsafety.asp">Foster Farms have to say</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Salmonella is naturally occurring in poultry and can be fully eradicated if raw product is properly handled and fully cooked,” said Dr. Robert O’Connor, the company’s food safety chief and head veterinarian. “All poultry producers strive to reduce bacterial presence, including Salmonella. We take food safety very seriously. When the incidence of illnesses linked to Salmonella increased, we wanted to know why and we have worked quickly to identify and implement additional controls. It is also important to reassure the public that the FSIS process has not been affected by the recent government shutdown.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably they also emphasize, in red:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No Recall is in Effect. Products are Safe to Consume if Properly Handled and Fully Cooked.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">Healthcare.GOV</a>, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/05/us-usa-healthcare-technology-analysis-idUSBRE99407T20131005">Reuters took a look at the issue</a>, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. For instance, when a user tries to create an account on HealthCare.gov, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, it prompts the computer to load an unusually large amount of files and software, overwhelming the browser, experts said. If they are right, then just bringing more servers online, as officials say they are doing, will not fix the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/10/01/in-debut-affordable-care-web-site-baffles-many-users/">New York Times reported on the site's debut</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the site took three years to build, it took only a few minutes for it to break down when it went live at 8 a.m. E.D.T. Some consumers said they were met with an error message in the early morning when trying to visit the Web site, which seemed to be overwhelmed with traffic and limited by apparent programming issues. Many people took to Twitter and Facebook to note that the site was down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/04/obamacare-disaster-or-routine-maintenance/">MSNBC asks</a> - disaster or routine maintenance?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HHS officials said that they will be taking down the “application part of the website” for scheduled maintenance this weekend, according to NBC News’ Kristin Welker. The announcement was red meat for critics of Obamacare, who have been largely silent since the health care law rolled out earlier this week. Speaker John Boehner said the administration’s announcement was proof that “the president’s health care law has been an unmitigated disaster.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, no reliable reports that I've been able to find blame the problem on a specific denial of service attack; rather, it appears to be a combination of sudden demand for the service, teething pains for a new site, and system complexity. I did not note any commentary from the Arbor Networks <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/asert/">ASERT</a> weblog, which writes about DDOS attacks. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/">Renesys</a>, usually a useful view on problems, is reporting on Internet downtime in Sudan and Syria. My heads-up site for Internet-wide problems, the <a href="http://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages">outages mailing list</a>, is silent. Strangely, the place I'd expect to have seen this show up - the automated news aggregator <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/131007/p12#a131007p12">Techmeme</a> - is also quiet (Update: see below for Techmeme coverage). The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/obamacare">Obamacare Reddit subboard</a> has some reports from people who made it through the system, and others who are having problems.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the problems like these are in the software. Hardware is the easy part. You can add more hardware and do it easily. Software takes more time. In the rush of getting this out, it seems like testing wasn’t done completely. My expectations from this is that these problems should go away in the next few weeks. The site still won’t be as fast as something like Netflix, but it should work.</p>

<p>From Sabra Briere, <a href="http://www.sabrabriere.org/First%20October%202013.php">First Ward News</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By my count, this agenda includes 2 action items – 14 administrative acts, 8 infrastructure changes, 1 that address public safety needs, 0 investments in economic development and 0 that relate to affordable housing. </p>

<p>From the Ann Arbor Chronicle, <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/04/ann-arbor-council-to-weigh-privilege-waiver/">Ann Arbor Council to Weigh Privilege Waiver</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A resolution that’s been added to the Ann Arbor city council’s Monday, Oct. 7, 2013 agenda would, if approved, result in the waiver of attorney-client privilege with respect to a specific advice memo that has already been written by the city attorney’s office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is about Al McWilliams, who was appointed by the Ann Arbor City Council on a 6-5 vote to join the Ann Arbor DDA; there is consideration that the vote requirement might have been 8 votes. There was talk that the minutes for the previous meeting might be contested as a result.</p>

<p>And, from the Ann Arbor News - well, there's nothing yet from the Ann Arbor News telling you there would be a meeting on Monday, or what it would be.

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c" alt="Images" title="Images" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> runs Tor ("The Onion Router"), a network designed to provide its users with anonymity when using the Internet. Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.</p>

<p>Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer. The description of the resources used to take down Silk Road did not mention any specific attacks on Tor; the proprietor of Silk Road left behind enough clues through sloppy tradecraft that it was possible through diligent efforts to identify him based on his public postings. The takedown of Silk Road caused a disturbance in the Force as seen through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/10/bitcoin-volatility-after-silk-road-shutdown.html">volatility in Bitcoin prices</a> seen right after the system was taken down.</p>

<p>Most recently the Guardian printed a Bruce Schneier piece on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity">Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity</a>. It goes into detail on the flaws in browser implementations that can be used to attack Tor anonymity as well as the peculiar attacks that only the NSA can take out by doing monkey-in-the-middle attacks on the Tor (and Internet) infrastructure. It's a good read, and exposes such lovely NSA code names as "EgotisticalGiraffe".</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Schneier piece is that it's not impossible to unmask the anonymity of Tor users, especially if they are sloppy in any way in their use of the system; there are enough bugs to go around in the components that make up a typical Tor browser bundle that it's likely that a dedicated effort to entrap a specific user will succeed. But it's hard work, and thus the Tor system works as its Naval Intelligence designers intended - only the most determined state actor can foil typical use of the system.</p>

<p>The best reporting from the Capitol today was from people close enough to the scene to be an eyewitness, yet not trapped in the need as a news organization to put a coherent story around the whole matter until it was well and thoroughly over. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I&#39;m watching the whole thing from my office. The air&#39;s full of gunpowder smoke.

<p>Once it was over, you could make out the outlines of a story; as it was happening, it was hard to tell what was really going on, what with a "fog of war" situation and lots of people who weren't anywhere near the scene breathlessly retweeting accounts from other people who also weren't there. There are still loose ends, like the name of the shooter, a confirmation that she is deceased, the identity of a child, and the condition of a police officer in the incident.</p>

<p>Some news clips, for reference:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/gunfire-reported-outside-the-capitol.html">NY Times</a> - "WASHINGTON — The United States Capitol was locked down for about a half-hour on Thursday afternoon after law enforcement officers shot and killed a woman who had been chased there in her car from the White House, law enforcement officials said." </p>

      <p>Frank’s Restaurant is under new management – as of October 1, says the sign. They are advertising extended late night hours.</p>

<p>Frank's is well known as "the fortified high point of Ann Arbor", according to its menus.</p>

<p>I wrote about Frank's 6 years ago as part of a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/placeshout---ht.html">review of Placeshout</a>, which was a simple application for taking short (100 character) notes on locations. That was from the era of the Ann Arbor "nova mob", a cadre of people who could be counted on to use any new social or review site and instantly propel Ann Arbor to the top of the list for cities reviewed, second usually only to San Francisco. Placeshout is gone (without even a goodbye message), and the nova mob has scattered to the winds. But Frank's is still here, and good luck to its new management.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here's a 24 hour snapshot from the <a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity</a>. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Why the volatility? It turns out that a popular Bitcoin trading site, Silk Road, has been shut down by the Feds. Silk Road was known for its free and easy Bitcoin-fueled trading in drugs, and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002">indictment alleges</a> that the proprietor, a certain Ross William Ulbricht, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts," also used the site to plan a contract "hit" on someone who crossed his path.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A power outage on a 138,000 volt line that provides power to Metro North trains in New York has snarled commutes from Connecticut to New York City and has also affected Amtrak service in the busy New York - Boston corridor. Work is underway to put in a temporary fix by diverting power from surrounding businesses and neighborhoods. A backup feeder line was offline, and full service restoration may take weeks.</p>

<p>Metro North is responding by putting diesel trains into service and by running buses to try to accommodate the 130,000 daily commuters on the line, but this provides only about a third of the capacity needed for a normal commute.</p>

<p>NY Times, "Power Failure Disrupts Metro North’s New Haven Line; May Last Days", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/metro-norths-new-haven-line-suspended-after-power-loss.html">September 25, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disruption began after a Consolidated Edison feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed around 5:20 a.m., snarling service between Stamford, Conn., and Grand Central Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CT Post, "Metro-North, Con Edison tested plan that led to failure", <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Metro-North-service-What-you-need-to-know-4845143.php">September 26, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it may take officials weeks to determine the cause, it appears the 138,000 volt line that was left to bear the burden of energizing trains along an eight-mile stretch of track in Westchester County, N.Y., from Pelham to Rye became overwhelmed and superheated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said yesterday that Con Edison representatives told him the company is working to get a portion of the electricity needed to the commuter line. The power would come from three transformers to be tested this weekend, Malloy said. He said updates will be provided to residents the night before the Sept. 30 commute. “There appears to have been little plan for this type of catastrophic failure,” Malloy said during the briefing at Grand Central.</p>

<p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck.</p>

<p>The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.</p>

<p>It's very different writing for someone else than it is for myself. Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor is not one of them. Rather, there's a terrifying time when you hit "publish" and the world either sees your headline and says "meh" or they pick it up and share it with their friends.</p>

<p>Ultimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I've written here before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unpolished-open-notebook.html">keeping an open notebook</a> and what that means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing. But when you're writing for someone else the whole package really wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a separate set of expectations.</p>

Here's some notes.</p>

<p>For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 meetup</a> which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</p>

<p>A brand new Meetup is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech</a> Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup, which had its first meeting the other night. This is a more classic meetup, one that tries to meet monthly rather than weekly, one that's similar to other groups around the country, and one where I'm starting out from the perspective that I mostly don't know everyone who's going to be interested.</p>

<p>Meetup is a form of civic technology (for the purpose of organizing meetings). For a2civictech, I've been able to use the function of annotating the photos from the meeting to remember who was there, and the little discussion forum around the event is just enough to prepare for meetings and remember what happened there. Meetup also allows you to track the input and output of money to the group, so it's reasonable to track expenses and reimbursement for even little bits of money.</p>

<p>The meetup system isn't free; a semi-annual fee of $72 applies. So by not being free it gives me the opportunity to have other folks help share in the cost of running things. a2civictech is sponsored in part by <a href="http://a2geeks.org">a2geeks</a> and that's been a great plus in getting it going. You can also share in the roles of actually organizing things by giving co-conspirators some additional rights to manage things.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most is that Meetup is actually designed pretty well to help you successfully organize a meeting. I'm so used to group-forming tools like Yahoo Groups and Google Groups where the goal is to have a discussion online and where the in-person efforts are a very late afterthought. The system comes with a checklist of all of the useful things you can do, and the automated emails for the event planner gently prompt you to do the right thing at the right time. There's obviously a lot of thought and evolution in this system which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>The verdict so far: worthwhile to continue for 6 months, and probably worth renewing.</p>
