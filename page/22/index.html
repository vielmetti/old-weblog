<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-18-an-active-if-diffuse-media-ecosystem/">An active if diffuse media ecosystem</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Anna Clark, writing in the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/advance_changes_gears_ann_arbor_mlive.php?page=all&amp;print=true">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.</p>

<p>The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. Further, I want to make very clear the difference between urgent breaking news and the sort of slog it out, cover it every day beat journalism that is mostly interesting in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Twitter has always been good for breaking news, whether it be local, national, or global. I'm perfectly convinced that in the case of the 100-year flood, we'll be covered. There's enough individual people who are capable of writing about what's happening to them in enough local detail that if an issue is city or county wide, Ann Arbor will be notified. Newspapers always do their best work in response to crisis, and local bloggers, radio, and metro Detroit television will all chip in. If something horrible or wonderful happens, we're all good as far as news goes.</p>

<p>That can't be said for every town, by the way. When Marshall, Michigan had an Enbridge pipeline burst in its midst, there was no local news media to write about or blog about the weird hydrocarbon smell. Ann Arbor has enough of a "diffuse media ecosystem" that such things should be noticed! However, you can't even count on that - a long-seeping sewer spill in the Arboretum was unnoticed for weeks - you'd hope that we'd catch something faster here.</p>

<p>It's the problem of news that's not urgent that I'm more worried about. Small retail businesses come and go, and you can't count on the Ann Arbor News to write about all of those retail changes. Crime, petty and otherwise, gets reported when the police department wants it to be reported, and thus you'll see a lot more Ypsilanti crime in the Ann Arbor paper than Ann Arbor crime just because of the willingness of YPD to share. The <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> does a fine job of bird-dogging city council, but its ferociously detailed coverage only extends so far. The <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> only comes out monthly, but it routinely scoops the daily media.</p>

<p>Short of finding someone with more money than sense to start a new publication, what can  you do? The CJR story says that people turn to "small independent news sites to fill in the gaps." As the Ann Arbor News shrinks, the opportunity to fill in the gaps should only grow. A narrowly focused topic that's interesting and that the dwindling mainstream media only gives cursory attention to would be perfect, and if you can give the world quick and accurate writing as well as compelling photography you'll be all set.</p>

<p>Small independent news sites are usually a labor of love, in some fashion. Notably they come and go as people's priorities change or as they age out of the "independent grad student blogger" demographic. It's almost the case that you need to recruit a new crop of writers every fall, purging your blogroll of the recently departed and scouring the net for the newest up-and-coming.So the local media infrastructure is active - there's no shortage of writing about Ann Arbor, both in local and in national publications. It's also incredibly diffuse, without a single dominant comprehensive news source that covers everything in detail. My best solution to date has to be tuned in to Twitter to catch what I can as it goes past, and write down what I see that's not getting enough notice so that I can contribute my small share.</p>


  <h3>13 September 2013</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-listening-to-baseball-online-with-global-tuners-radio/">Listening to baseball online with Global Tuners radio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a>. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).</p>

<p>First, you'll need a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a> account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. The way it works is that the receivers are hooked up to a digital front end that lets you tune them remotely and that plays back the audio through the net. In general only one person can tune in at a time, so it's first come first served. </p>

<p>Second, you'll need to have some idea of which AM and FM stations your favorite team's radio network covers. For example, the <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/schedule/radioaffiliates.jsp">Detroit Tigers radio network</a> has AM and FM station ranging from Houghton in the U.P. to Toledo Ohio and Angola Indiana, and the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp">Houston Astros radio network</a> also covers San Antonio and Shreveport. If the Tigers play the Astros, you can possibly tune to either network's stations - you'll either get home or away team coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, and here's the tricky part, you'll want to figure out which of the tuners covers which of the stations you are interested in. As it happens none of the tuners cover any stations that the Tigers routinely broadcast on, but the Astros are on KTKR 760 AM <a href="http://www.ticket760.com/main.html">Ticket 760</a> in San Antonio, and there's a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/info.php?r=1155">receiver in San Antonio</a> that might be free to listen through to them.</p>

<p>Figuring out radio channels can be weird - some stations have higher power and transmit over clear channels for long distances, and others don't cover much more ground than the city they are based in. So the "best" channel to tune in might be for a station that's powerful but far away. When you search through the MLB.com site for stations, look for the "flagship" station listed, which often broadcasts with higher power and over a greater distance than the other stations in the network. As an example, here's a report of <a href="http://globaltuners.blogspot.com/2011/10/knbr.html">hearing the San Francisco Giants</a> from a tuner in Phoenix, AZ more than 600 miles away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signal was weak at a distance of over 650 miles, with little interference from other stations but some noise and fading.  Nonetheless, the content was usable and the station IDs clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hobby of DXing gets an extra boost when you can tune in to radios that are far away. It's fun to scan the dial and hear what's out there. Most tuners have a band scan listing that you can see what's there. I listen to remote radio stations on <a href="http://www.tunein.com">Tunein</a> as well, but there's not the same sense of being there when the reception is too perfect, and the baseball powers that be block internet-based games over regular radio channels.</p>


  <h3>13 September 2013</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-changes-at-annarborcom-newspaper-rebrands-as-ann-arbor-news-shuts-down-website/">Changes at AnnArbor.com; newspaper rebrands as Ann Arbor News, shuts down website</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new? Were all of the URLs that I had collected for stories on <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> going to suddenly go 404 on me? Was it going to be impossible for me to provide news clippings proving that I had produced a story every day for months on end? All a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Things are bad, but not as bad as they would seem.</p>

<p>All of the old content on AnnArbor.com is still there, but all of the navigation that would help you find it is gone. If you view the <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> home page through your web browser it will redirect to MLive. Fortunately, any deeper links within the site still work, so you can see e.g. my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/foia-friday-index/">FOIA Friday index</a> and all of the links there still work. There's even a search engine (using Google search) on that page.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aannarbor.com+vielmetti&amp;oq=site%3Aannarbor.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i58j69i61j69i59.1939j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#psj=1&amp;q=site:annarbor.com+vielmetti">search Google</a> for "site:AnnArbor.com vielmetti" you'll get back a page of links, but half of them won't work - any tag, category, or section in the old site redirects to MLive. This means that if you were a blogger and were carefully tagging your stuff so that it could be found again, all of that effort is gone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s "Wayback Machine" to the rescue, at least in part. That site faithfully and patiently scraped content from AnnArbor.com and stored it away forever, and it preserved enough of the links and surrounding content that it is possible to navigate up to a point. The Internet Archive's collection even includes the current temperature for the day that the page was saved! It's not perfect - some links will still break - but it's much better than nothing.</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of the MLive site - it's slow, disorienting, and hard to search through and navigate. But it's what we now have, and I don't hold out any promise for radical reinvention of that system. Rather, I expect that Ann Arbor newspaper readers will get an increasingly thin product, watered down with repurposed statewide news and ever more devoid of local identity. Fortunately there's the <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> bird-dogging civic meetings and the <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> observing changes in the area, so not all is lost.</p>

<p>Some more local views on the topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/09/the-ann-arbor-news-is-back.html">Damn Arbor</a> notes that the Ann Arbor News is back, and his lead paragraph is worthwhile repeating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turritopsis nutricula, the immortal jellyfish, is unique among animals in that it can revert back to its clonal polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. In a similar process, The Com announced today that it would be reverting back to its previous state as the Ann Arbor News and reintegrating the MLive Media Group as part of MLive.com. It should be be noted The Com exists as a subsidiary of MLive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://markmaynard.com/2013/09/my-thoughts-on-the-death-of-annarbor-com/">Mark Maynard</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know you might be tempted to be pissed off anew over today’s announcement, but I think it bears repeating that, at least in the short term, we need for M-Live and the new twice-weekly Ann Arbor News to be successful. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the national point of view:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/advance_publications_scraps_an.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a> says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advance is now about to fold AnnArbor.com (the website) into MLive.com, the company’s Michigan portal based on its hideous website template. This is what’s on the homepage of MLive as I type. Prepare to shield your eyes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The city of Boulder, Colorado is flooded after several days of torrential rains. Here's some useful links if you want to get up to speed on what's going on.</p>

<p>Turn around, don't drown. If you're in the affected area, get authoritative news from local sources (and not this blog).</p>

<h3>Scanner</h3>

<p>For raw unfiltered news of what is happening, listen to the emergency services scanner for the Boulder area. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/591">Boulder County Sheriff and Fire</a> feed has over 800 listeners as of this writing. You'll want to listen through headphones, because the feed is a stereo feed with fire/rescue on one channel and police on the other.</p>

<p>A good text counterpart to this is the <a href="http://twitter.com/boulderoem">Boulder Office of Emergency Management twitter</a> feed, which has brief and authoritative updates about the situation. The <a href="http://boulderoem.org">Boulder OEM web site</a> echoes those updates in more detail.</p>

<h3>Local news media</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/">Daily Camera</a> is Boulder's daily newspaper, and it has continuous updates on the situation. Their <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_24072038/boulder-county-broomfield-under-flash-flood-warning-major">September 12 story</a> is a long list of incidents, warnings, accounts and stories about what's going on. Twitter: @<a href="http://twitter.com/dailycamera">dailycamera</a></p>

<p>There's flooding in the Denver area as well, and the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com">Denver Post</a> is on it. A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24077193/boulder-county-flood-emergency-1-killed-streets-impassable">September 12 Denver Post story</a> notes the extent of the damage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy rain and massive flooding threatens towns and cities up and down the Front Range into the day Thursday as communities were evacuated, roads closed and emergency shelters set up.
  Three people were confirmed dead and at least one missing.
  At an afternoon news conference Boulder officials said at least 12 dams in the county had overflowed.The Boulder airport was closed as well as Boulder mountain parks and open space until further notice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>As ever, Twitter is on the scene when there's news. The #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boulderflood">boulderflood</a> and #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cowx">cowx</a> hashtags have been trending, with photos, video, and brief accounts of what's happening. A #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23coflood">coflood</a> tag covers flooding across Colorado.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>A map has been removed per the owner's request on 25 October 2013.</p>

<p>The City of Boulder has a <a href="http://gisweb.ci.boulder.co.us/agswebsites/general/iemcop/index.htm">road closures map</a> with markers showing where roads are closed or impassible. Officials are recommending that people stay off the roads.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, September 12 in the evening I have not been able to find a good clear map that shows the full extent of affected areas, and emergency operations are still in rescue mode.</p>

<p>Google has a <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-boulder-floods">crisis map for the 2013 Boulder Floods</a>. This is a snapshot as of Friday, September 13, in the morning. The dots mark places where roads are closed, and the evacuation area for Longmont is shown as the St Vrain River bisects the town. Look at the current map for the latest details, and know that roads are being opened and closed in response to changing needs.</p>

<h3>Water levels</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=bou&amp;gage=bocc2">Boulder Creek hydrograph</a> shows current water levels measured in Boulder. As of this writing the creek is in "moderate flood stage" and rising.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>This flood is being compared to the 1894 Boulder flood. The <a href="http://boulderhistory.org/boulders_great_flood.asp">Boulder History Museum</a> account of that flood reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As rains continued, adding to spring runoff, Boulder Creek began to rise. The threat of a flood was serious. Overnight, the creek rose out of its banks and rushed through the canyons above Boulder. By daybreak the creek had turned into an angry river, carrying debris from the settlements and bridges it destroyed in the mountains. In Boulder, the creek had begun its destruction as it swept the Sixth and Twelfth Street bridges downstream. The flood submerged railroad tracks, roads and farms, and tore down telephone and telegraph poles, taking Boulder’s means of transportation and communication out of commission.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I don't know what other people's experiences are, but increasingly I'm finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone's wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.</p>

<p>The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks).</p>

<p>My phone has a bandwidth cap so I don't know if I can keep this up all month, and it's always better to use a fast free unlimited connection than a limited one that you bring yourself. I'm just wondering if this is a sign of a long-term trend where the wifi that you carry with yourself everywhere is faster, more reliable, and less error-prone than the "free" public infrastructure.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-03-a-localwiki-for-the-marquette-michigan-area/">A localwiki for the Marquette, Michigan area</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There's no better way to learn about your home town than by trying to start a wiki for it. In that regard, I'm happy to announce a new <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/">Localwiki installation for Marquette County, Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> crew has developed a new hosting platform for people who want to start a wiki for their area, but who don't have the resources or the time or the skills to launch their own server. It runs on <a href="http://localwiki.net">Localwiki.net</a>, and currently has about two dozen sites up and running. Your town or region could be next!</p>

<p>When I originally envisioned doing a wiki for Marquette, I was thinking ambitiously and thought "hey, I'll do the whole U.P." I'm glad I didn't, not at least yet. There's enough small amounts of nitty-gritty detail about local history, ghost towns, old mines, and bits of industrial archaeology that I have just enough knowledge to tackle for the Marquette area, but don't have any clue where I'd start for Houghton or Escanaba or the Soo. Someone else can tackle that.</p>

<p>Marquette County is the biggest county (by area) in Michigan, so there's plenty of geography to cover. It's also home to some political subdivisions like <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Humboldt_Township">Humboldt Township</a> that have less than 500 inhabitants, no post office of their own, and no chance ever that anyone there would start a wiki just for that place alone.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a>, which covers Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County, I see this as the very first step towards a project that could last a long time. At a few pages a day for a few years you could start to get to the point where you had enough material to be useful for a visitor, a local, or a historian, and where people who would never be notable enough for a first draft biography on Wikipedia might get properly noted or memorialized. I'm looking forward to learning more so that the next time I visit I'll be that much better informed.</p>

<p>I'm starting to use <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">MedHelper</a> for Android as a tool to keep track of my medicine. As you get older, it's more and more likely that you'll be on some medication, and since I've had side effects from previous meds I'm happy to find something that helps me track things.</p>

<p>It's a relatively complicated program compared to some simple pill reminder apps on the market, but my use is relatively simple. There's a reminder function to alert you when it's time to take your medicine, a log that tracks when you actually did take your meds, and a simple comment log that lets you add notes about how it's going or any side effects you noticed. If you're doing detailed logging of weight, blood pressure, or a number of other vital signs there's a place for that.</p>

<p>At the moment there's no web-based version of it, but the site hints at a "cloud" version, which I suppose I'd welcome.</p>

<p>The test of any software like this is twofold. First, does it help you actually follow your prescription better than a simple alarm or a pillbox. Second, does it help you when you are at the doctor's office talking about your health. I haven't tested either, but I'm looking forward to updating this review when I get a few months of actual use in place.</p>

      <p>Originally seen on <a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/">Deadline Detroit</a>, my go-to place for quick hits on Detroit news - the <a href="http://metrotimes.com/">Metro Times</a> is up for sale. If you ever wanted to be in journalism now's your chance.</p>

<p><a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/articles/6165/for_sale_the_metro_times">From the article</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company that owns the Metro Times told its Detroit staff this morning (August 26, 2013) the paper is for sale, throwing the future of the 33-year-old alternative weekly into doubt at a time of great uncertainty for print publications.</p>
  
  <p>Few details were available; employees were told not to speak to the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was noted (and I can't recall where, sorry) that there is no independent library that has a full run of the Metro Times archived, and there's a reasonable concern that if the Metro Times morgue is sold along with the paper that a big piece of Detroit music history could be lost.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A note from Steve Pierce regarding a request for ideas and code to help people log into a free WiFi mesh network. Contact him for details at bottom.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://hdl.com">HDL.com</a> and volunteers have deployed a free WiFi network in SE Michigan over the last 5 years. With over 1,000 access points deployed and 650,000 unique devices connected, <a href="http://wireless.ypsi.com">Wireless Ypsi</a> and companion networks such as <a href="http://detroitenabled.org/">Detroit Enabled</a> are averaging over 2,500 users per day, making it one of the largest free WiFi networks in the country.</p>

<p>The equipment and connections are paid for by local community groups like Focus Hope and Public Housing along with business owners and community champions. No money is charged to use the WiFi service, nor is there any advertising revenue. </p>

<p>The free network, called Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled is HDL.com’s way of giving back to the community. We help secure Internet bandwidth and donate time and equipment to support the free network.</p>

<p>The struggle we face is making sure we comply with Internet Service providers terms of service agreements. One recent requirement is to not have anonymous access to the network. While we would love to have open and free Internet for everyone, the reality is Internet service costs money and the major carriers like Comcast and AT&amp;T don’t provide the service for free. So while Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled offer free WiFi for residents, business and visitors, someone still needs to pay for the connections.</p>

<p>To continue to use these paid connections we need a system that will allow people to sign up for free accounts to use the service. We want something akin to Facebook or Twitter that will allow for instant sign up and use of the free WiFi network.</p>

<p>Users would provide their name, address, phone and email address and chose a secure password. They would immediately be granted access to the network for one day. A confirmation email link is sent to the email address and it must be confirmed to continue to use the service beyond the first day.</p>

<p>Authentication would use a RADIUS server or similar service which would need to be selected, as well. We must insure proper data security and programming techniques are used to protect the data.</p>

<p>Not having a login and registration system is the single largest barrier we face today to continued large scale deployments of free WiFi. We have proven with our 5 year success story that the network is reliable and sustainable. Yet not having a login and registration system has virtually stopped us from expanding services into new areas until we can address this need.</p>

<p>Much more information about the Rim Fire, including maps, is available through <a href="http://inciweb.org/incident/3660/">InciWeb</a> system. The August 25 update reads as follows:</p>

<p>&gt; The Rim Fire continues to burn on the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park, Bureau of Land Management and State responsibility land. The fire is exhibiting continued growth to the northeast and east. On the western side of the fire, crews successfully conducted firing operations to bring the fire line down to the Tuolumne River in efforts to keep the fire from spreading to the west toward the Highway 108 corridor. Aerial resources continue to be effective in reducing the spread of fire toward the Highway 108 corridor. Crews continue to construct line construction where accessibility and safety allows. In addition, structure defense and contingency planning continues in the Mather area.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 23, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18169">declared a state of emergency</a> for San Francisco, noting that the fire threatens both power and water resources for the city.</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the wildfires that started in Tuolumne County have caused damage to electrical infrastructure serving the City and County of San Francisco, and now threaten damage to property, equipment, and resources of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department; and</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been forced to shut down transmission lines with the result that the City and County is affected by the wildfires in the County of Tuolumne and is likely to be further affected should the fire cause additional damage to the City and County of San Francisco’s water and electrical assets in Tuolumne County, including the possible temporary interruption of electricity and/or water delivery;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.</p>

<p>Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.</p>

<p>It's worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time. Fortunately both boys are self-propelled on bicycles to get to school.</p>

<p>Apples are back in season, after a full year last year without them. The reports from market suggest that the crop is going to be a good one.</p>

<p>Football parking is back on the agenda - football itself, not so much, but the crowds that come with games can mean a juicy allowance for the intrepid soul who has a front yard and a driveway with extra spaces for cars.</p>

<p>There's a tally of the things that didn't get done this summer. Strawberry picking didn't happen (papa had a bad morning), and blueberry picking didn't work out that well (the youngest couldn't reach the high bush berries). I'm hoping that our Ypsilanti raspberry patch will be free from the fly infestation (spotted wing Drosophila) that has wiped out several other berrypicking locations nearby.</p>

<p>Farmers Market is always worth going to this time of year. Late summer suppers with green beans, tomatoes, and corn are a joy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It wasn't completely internet-free, because there was wifi at my Mom's place and wifi at McDonald's for the occasional stops and wifi at the very nice Dead River Cafe in Marquette. But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn't have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places I would have liked to have captured in the moment while I was there with a camera and with Twitter to share them. For example, there's the cutest little gazebo-like structure on the Iron Ore Heritage Trail underneath the LS&amp;I railroad trestle. It's cute until you realize that it's there to deflect the ore pellets off the trail and off of the heads of passing bicyclists as they go under an active set of tracks.</p>

<p>I also missed there being a local wiki to look things up in (and to add my own commentary to) for the Upper Peninsula, along the lines of Ann Arbor's Arborwiki. There's a lot of history in the area that's still relatively unwritten, and it would have been fantastic to have a place to store bits of commentary and observations without necessarily broadcasting a stream of social media to my long-suffering friends.</p>

<p>I'm back, not having missed Facebook much at all, and not having been tethered to a Twitter update stream, and only 100 messages behind in my inbox.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://twitter.com/bobneedham">Bob Needham</a>, long time Ann Arbor News and AnnArbor.com entertainment editor, has left the friendly confines of the newspaper industry to join the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business as a "paragraph wrangler". </p></li>
<li><p>Whittaker's Berry Farm in Ida, MI is closed for the season early because of an invasion of <a href="http://www.ipm.msu.edu/invasive_species/spotted_wing_drosophila">Spotted Wing Drosophila</a> (SWD). This vinegar fly ruins crops and is a relatively recent immigrant to Michigan (2010).</p></li>
<li><p>The Washtenaw County Road Commission has taken to telling anyone who wants information about the roads to <a href="http://www.wcroads.org/sites/all/themes/wcroads/pdfs/foia-request-form.pdf">file a FOIA request</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Damn Arbor editor Ben Connor Barrie has <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/08/coming-clean.html">moved to Ypsilanti</a>, prompting Mark Maynard to run an <a href="http://markmaynard.com/2013/08/ypsilanti-immigration-interview-erika-jost-and-ben-connor-barrie/">immigration interview</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Chris Dzombak is <a href="http://arborwx.com/2013/08/21/closing-down-arborwx/">closing down</a> the hyperlocal ArborWX weather blog in favor of slightly broader pastures; he'll be an <a href="http://chris.dzombak.name/blog/2013/08/my-next-step.html">iOS developer for the New York Times</a> starting this fall.</p></li>

      <p>Microsoft's Outlook.com service was down for three days; here's a detailed writeup at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/08/17/microsoft-apologizes-for-three-day-outlook-com-outage-says-caching-issue-was-to-blame/">The Next Web</a>. A summary of sorts: "The failure caused these devices to receive an error and continuously try to connect to our service. This resulted in a flood of traffic that our services did not handle properly."</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On August 15 2013, Cisco announced that it would be laying off 5% of its workforce, or about 4000 employees. Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1236468">Cisco Q4 2013 earnings report</a> does not mention layoffs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/14/us-cisco-results-idUSBRE97D16W20130814?type=companyNews">Reuters</a>: Cisco cutting 4,000 jobs</li>
<li><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323639704579013113620184906-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwNDExNDQyWj.html">Wall Street Journal</a>: "We just have too much in the middle of the organization," Mr. Chambers said.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130814/p29#a130814p29">Techmeme</a> leads with the WSJ story.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Because we need to continue to accelerate how we capture growth opportunities, we are taking a series of actions such as reducing management layers, prioritizing R&amp;D investments and a workforce reduction affecting about 4,000 employees, or 5 percent of our workforce."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23862152/cisco-systems-reports-increased-sales-and-profit">Mercury News</a> has a history of Cisco layoffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 4,000 job cuts that Cisco Systems announced Wednesday are the latest in several major staff reductions by the San Jose networking company. Others include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>July 2012: 1,300 jobs, about 2 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>July 2011: 6,500 jobs, 4,400 through layoffs and 2,100 through early retirement packages, representing 9 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>February 2009: 2,000 jobs out of a workforce of 66,560</li>
  <li>April 2001: 8,500 jobs, including 6,000 full-time employees and 2,500 contractors</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more than 5,000 members on LinkedIn of the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=832&amp;mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah">Cisco Alumni Association</a>; if you are laid off in this round or if you had previously left Cisco, you are welcome to join.</p>
