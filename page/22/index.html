      </h3>
      <p><strong>Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Frost</strong> (1952 - March 2011) was a professor at the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu" target="_self">University of Michigan School of Information</a>.

Frost was the great-grandson of poet <a href="http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu/misc/poet.html" target="_self">Robert Frost</a>, and established the&#0160;<a href="http://www.umich.info/about-SI/news-detail.htm?NewsItemID=571" target="_self">Frost Open Access Fund</a>&#0160;with royalties from his great-grandfather&#39;s works to&#0160;support faculty and student projects related to open access to information. He is survived by his wife&#0160;Margaret Hedstrom; relations, colleagues, current and former students and many friends. Donations may go to the American Cancer Society via <a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost" target="_self">Team Frost</a>. Additional details are pending.</p>
<p>There will be a memorial service for Bob Frost held on <strong>Friday, April 15 at 3:00 p.m.</strong> at the Michigan Union Ballroom in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Frost was interviewed for Michigan Today in Winter of 1996, in a story published under the title <a href="http://michigantoday.umich.edu/96/Win96/mta4w96.html" target="_self">Robert Frost&#39;s great-grandson is not a big fan of the poetry</a>.</p>
<p>A number of Bob&#39;s friends, colleagues and students have written in memoriam, collected in small part here.</p>
<p>Mark Matienzo: <a href="http://thesecretmirror.com/blog/2011/03/27/in-memoriam-bob-frost/" target="_self">In memoriam</a>. &quot;Most importantly, he was a faculty member in a huge and ever-growing graduate program who seemed to enjoy nearly every interaction he had with a student, and encouraged us to reach out to him to send him links to &quot;cool stuff&quot; on the Web that might interest him.&quot;</p>
<p>University of Michigan School of Information Dean Jeffrey Mackie-Mason announced his death with this message, which was circulated widely and is reproduced here.</p>
<blockquote>Date: Sat, Mar 26, 2011 at 11:49 PM</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dear friends, students, colleagues</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is with deep personal sadness that I write to tell you that Bob Frost has passed away. He expired while resting at home, with his wife -- our colleague Margaret Hedstrom -- and family members by his side. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>As many of you know, because Bob was a delightfully transparent and honest person, he has been fighting cancer for nearly two-and-a-half years. &#0160;He had remarkable courage, and fortitude (the initial prognosis was that he had less than a year to live). Bob was passionate about teaching, about his students, and about our School. &#0160;He insisted on continuing to teach a full load, and even developed new courses during his illness. &#0160;Remarkably, he was still in the classroom teaching SI 500 less than three weeks ago. &#0160;Many generations of undergraduate and graduate students have been touched by Bob; many of them say that he had a transformative impact on their choice of major and career. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was born in 1952, and received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983. He came to Michigan as a visiting associate professor of history in 1995, and joined the SI faculty in 2000. For more information about his many publications, his teaching and his other interests, see&#0160;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/" target="_blank">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/</a>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was passionate about many things, including a passion for sharing information for the good of all. &#0160;Bob and Margaret established the Frost Open Access Fund by donating the royalties that Bob receives from the works of his great-grandfather, poet Robert Frost. &#0160;The fund was also named to honor Bob&#39;s friend and colleague Olivia Frost, SI&#39;s former interim dean and professor emerita. &#0160;The Frost Fund supports innovative projects that utilize open source software, or that study or promote the open access movement.</blockquote>

<p>Car 49 &quot;The Parkers&quot;, engineered by a Ford Motor Company marketing employee and driven by his son, a student at Ann Arbor Christian School, won the third annual Ann Arbor Box Car Derby. The derby, sponsored by Ann Arbor Active Against ALS and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, raised an estimated $4,000 today to help families affected by ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. The winning vehicle was designed and built in less than a week from engineered cellulose biomaterials and recycled automotive marketing materials.</p>

<p><strong>Obituary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lamb, Robert Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot;, &quot;Ffej&quot;, &quot;Honey Bunny&quot;</strong></p>
<p>January 16, 1949 - March 22, 2011</p>
<p>Jeff was born in Oberlin, Ohio, and shortly afterward his family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He attended public schools in Ann Arbor and earned a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the University of Michigan. In 1978, Jeff moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, a city he loved dearly until the day he died. It was there that he met his loving wife, Leyla, who was visiting New Orleans from Hannover, Germany. Jeff and Leyla were married in Ann Arbor in 1986 and lived there happily until his death.</p>
<p>Jeff was a professional photographer whose extraordinary photographs of New Orleans, Detroit, Ann Arbor and the Leelanau Peninsula will stand the test of time. He showed his love for New Orleans by documenting the architecture of the city and worked closely with the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. After Jeff moved back to Ann Arbor, he continued his photography career and established many professional contacts throughout the world. His work has been influential, especially after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and destroyed many of the homes of which Jeff had taken photographs. He established deep connections with other photographers in New Orleans and made many close friends there through Facebook.&#0160;Jeff also photographed historic homes in Ann Arbor and was instrumental in trying to save the Ann Arbor Seven.</p>
<p>Jeff was preceded in death by his parents, Jane and Robert Lamb; and sister, Susan. He is survived by his wife, Leyla Lau-Lamb; his dog, Sonny; a cousin, David (Susan) Emmett of Howell, Michigan; nephew, Bryan Emmett (Shawnee); niece, Kelin Emmett; and many friends around the world who miss him terribly. He was one of a kind. There will be a celebration of Jeff&#39;s life at Hathaway&#39;s Hideaway, 310 S. Ashley, Ann Arbor, on April 9th beginning at 4:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Jeff&#39;s name to The Advocacy Department of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans, 923 Tchoupitoulas St., New Orleans, LA 70130.</p>

Here&#39;s this week&#39;s event calendar, mostly for events in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan. Note that it doesn&#39;t include every possible thing going on, just what people tell me about, and what is interesting enough for me to notice and plan ahead for. I&#39;ll be at some of these, I hope.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-03-23-huron-river-waterwatch/">Huron River water level watching: USGS National Water Information System</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Follow the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=04174500" target="_self">level of the Huron River as it goes through Ann Arbor</a>&#0160;with the USGS National Water Information System. On March 23, the river is rising, but it&#39;s also fluctuating in levels, enough that it&#39;s difficult to determine whether current trends would lead you to believe that there is any risk of flooding.</p>
<p><a href="http://137.227.241.67/nwisweb/data/img/USGS.04174500.02.00065..20110316.20110323..0..gif"><img alt="image from 137.227.241.67" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="image from 137.227.241.67" /></a>If you were to watch this closely, what would you watch?</p>
<p>The USGS will give you an alert if the level of the river is above or below a certain level.</p>
<p>The first derivative is the rate of change of the water level. You&#39;d want to track that to note trends. If you measured the difference between adjacent water levels, you&#39;d identify spikes, which have been associated with work on the dam in the past; those will give you a metric on the order of rate of change in inches per hour. If you did some smoothing, you&#39;d find trending measured in feet per day.</p>
<p>The second derivative is the rate of the rate of change of the water level; you&#39;re looking for that to identify erratic behavior. As a rule of thumb a time series with large movements in both directions (up and down) over a short amount of time is a sign of river disturbance.</p>
<p>A plausible approach would be to compute a smoothed curve, and then alert on deviations from the smoothed curve. You&#39;d love to be able to tell the difference between sudden downpour, steady rain, flash flood, work on the dam, and dam failure.</p>
<p>Another strip chart to line up with this is rainfail (measured in convenient units) and precipitation forecast.</p>
<p>This forecast is from <a href="http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/new/index.php?m=real&amp;r=mi&amp;w=map" target="_self">USGS Waterwatch for Michigan</a>. Hidden behind the projected water level is a rainfall forecast for the watershed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>March 22 is <a href="http://www.worldwaterday.org/" target="_self">World Water Day</a>. The 2011 theme is <a href="http://www.worldwaterday2011.org/" target="_self">Water for Cities: Responding to the Urban Challenge</a>. The Ann Arbor District Library is hosting a 7:00 p.m. panel &quot;<a href="http://www.aadl.org/node/40109" target="_self">Our Water, Our Future</a>&quot;, with&#0160;<strong><a href="http://snre.umich.edu/profile/mjwiley" target="_self">Mike Wiley</a></strong> from the <a href="http://www.snre.umich.edu" target="_self">University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment</a> hosting.</p>
<p id="player1">A <a href="http://www.aadl.org/video/view/9676" target="_self">recording of the event</a> is available for viewing or download at the Ann Abor District Library.</p>
<p>In Ann Arbor, the slow-moving but inexorable urban water supply problem is the spread of a dioxane plume towards the Huron River and the City of Ann Arbor&#39;s drinking water supply source at Barton Pond. The map below shows the newly expanded zone in which wells are prohibited in Ann Arbor because of this plume, which originated at the former Gelman Sciences facility on Wagner Road in Scio Township. <a href="http://www.pall.com/life_sciences.asp" target="_self">Pall Life Sciences</a>&#0160;now operates the cleanup at this facility; it&#39;s part of <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:PLL" target="_self">Pall Corporation (NYSE: PLL)</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There&#39;s a storm coming, which may bring some mix of rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, and ice pellets to Ann Arbor. The worst of it will be on Wednesday, March 23 2011, &#0160;the date of the Roman festival of <a href="http://sights.seindal.dk/sight/1200_Tubilustrium.html" target="_self">Tubilustrium</a>. This event was&#0160;held in honor of Vulcan, the god of fire and metal working.</p>

<p>The three-day cumulative precipitation forecast makes it pretty clear we&#39;re going to get some kind of weather, but if you squint you can make the difficulty of a precise forecast clear. Depending on a few degrees change in temperature, Ann Arbor and the area could get mostly rain, mostly snow, some nasty ice or the dreaded &quot;wintry mix&quot;.</p>

<p>Each quarter I celebrate the modern holiday of&#0160;<a href="http://www.discardia.com/" target="_self">Discardia</a>.&#0160;This quarter&#39;s Discardia runs from&#0160;March 20 (the vernal equinox) to April 3 (the new moon).&#0160;Here&#39;s some of the things I did with my kids this Discardia season.</p>
<p>My younger son wanted a new LEGO set, but all of his current LEGO bricks are scattered hither and yon. After much shopping at the hardware store, we ended up with a multi-compartment portable storage box. Now the boys can sort through the LEGO they have and find the parts they want to build their own custom creations, instead of asking me if they can buy a new set. It made cleaning up the living room a lot more straightforward.</p>

<p>Make the first version <strong>coherent</strong>. A first version that stands alone and accurate to itself might just be a concise headline and a lead paragraph.

      <p>Click to animate this plume of fallout from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, as produced by <a href="http://www.zamg.ac.at/" target="_self">ZAMG</a>&#0160;(Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik,&#0160;<a href="http://www.zamg.ac.at/">Viennese Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics</a>, Vienna Austria). Via the Harvard <a href="http://cegrp.cga.harvard.edu/japan/?q=content/maps" target="_self">Japan Sendai Earthquake Data Portal</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the hoax map &quot;<a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/technology/fallout.asp" target="_self">Nuclear fallout</a>&quot; described by Snopes.</p>
<p>Of the map, the authors write (in German)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zur Farbskalierung ist zu sagen, dass die rote Skala Gebiete kennzeichnet, die seit Beginn des Unfalles mit einer Effektivdosis von&#0160;<strong>maximal</strong>&#0160;100 Milli-Sievert pro Stunde belastet waren (laut Informationen der IAEO). Die violette Skala zeigt daher maximal 100 Nano-Sievert pro Stunde an. Dieser Wert ist, selbst über ein Jahr summiert, niedriger als die natürliche Belastung, der jeder Mensch ausgesetzt ist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as translated&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the colour scaling of the simulation, one needs to keep in mind that the red colour marks areas around the plant where&#0160;the effective dose rates were, at the absolute maximum, 100 Milli-Sievert per hour (according to information released by IAEA in&#0160;Vienna). The violet colour thus shows areas with estimated effective dose rates of 100 Nano-Sievert (maximum) per hour. Summed&#0160;up over a period of one year, this would still be less than the natural radiation exposure of an average citizen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this is a simulation, and based on dispersion calculations. Actual measurements of observed nucleotides have been collected from locations monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, as noted in this March 16 post &quot;<a href="http://www.zamg.ac.at/aktuell/index.php?seite=1&amp;artikel=ZAMG_2011-03-16GMT12:35" target="_self">CTBTO Messnetz misst erste Radioaktivitätswerte über Japan/ Korrektur</a>&quot;.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote a weekly <a href="http://annarbor.com/vielmetti/foia-friday-index">FOIA Friday</a> column for AnnArbor.com for about a year. The position that I had was eliminated in layoffs in March 2011, as the Ann Arbor Chronicle's story <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/03/13/history-repeats-at-annarbor-com/">History Repeats at AnnArbor.com</a> describes. Ironically, I was laid off the week before the newspaper industry promotes Sunshine Week, though I am certain that was just coincidence.</p>
<p>What do you do with all of this experience in dealing with the Freedom of Information Act? Here's a quick poll to generate some ideas. Feel free to add your own, if the one you want isn't listed or mentioned.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://widget.allourideas.org/foiajobs" width="500" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"> </iframe></p>
<p>The poll is from the Princeton based <a href="http://www.allourideas.org">All Our Ideas</a>, which is much niftier than any other survey research tool I've used.</p>

      <p>Every week at a2b3 I ask people to tell me about upcoming events. Here&#39;s this week&#39;s event calendar, mostly for events in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan.

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a view from Ann Arbor of the Japanese earthquake. A magnitude 8.9 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan at 5:46 UTC, 2:46 pm Japan time, and 12:46 a.m. Eastern Time, about 6200 miles from Ann Arbor. Damage is extensive, with the city of Sendai hit hard, and concern for the&#0160;Fukushima Nuclear Plant. The effects of the tsunami stretched across the Pacific.</p>

Sounds like our hotel in the Kona area in the Big Island may have some damage.&quot;</p>
