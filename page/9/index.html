      </h3>
      <p>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.</p>

<p>What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that's visibly not the only issue at hand.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight's Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled. Bryant Elementary now closed in Ann Arbor due to power outage-caused heating failure. Students that arrived at school sent back home.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor District Library: "The power is out at Malletts Creek Branch, it is currently closed. All other @aadl locations will open at 10 AM. Stay tuned for updates!"</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township offices are closed.</p>

<p>14-B District Court is closed.</p>

<p>Eastern Michigan University: Rec/IM: Due to technical problems, the Jones Pool will be closed until further notice. We apologize for the inconvenience. (via @EMU_Swoop)</p>

<p>Chelsea Police say power is still out and is expected to be out for "the next several hours," as of 8:15 a.m. Chelsea schools have also been closed. (Heritage News) Chelsea Center for the Arts will be closed today, Monday, November 18, 2013 due to a citywide power outage.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) Fifth Anniversary</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c img-responsive" alt="Aael-cvga-300x225" title="Aael-cvga-300x225" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-800wi" border="0" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I went with S and J to the <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive</a> (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman">David S. Carter</a> (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.</p>

<p>There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. An annual collection budget of about $13,000 buys new games and the occasional old console from eBay. The archive has a near complete collection of US consoles, and Dave said they are looking to expand their international coverage. One of their latest acquisitions was a DVD system that plays only one title. The archive would like to improve its collection of handheld games.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of the next five years is with digital rights management (DRM). The DRM systems envisioned would lock a game to a particular piece of console hardware, making it impossible to have used games and very hard for a library to add a title to a collection. For network-delivered games like Steam it's equally hard for the library to spend $10 on a license, when licenses negotiated by libraries for things like electronic versions of journals are usually for much more.</p>

<p>Dave said the archive was pretty much where they want to be after 5 years. He knew they were on the right track when they got space in the library even before they had a budget. The challenge of next five years is less collection building and more about building connections across campus and around the world to other research collections. He compared the collection to early film and video collections, now standard at all research libraries, but once considered a novelty.</p>

<p>Other comparable collections are at the <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/videogamearchive/index.php">University of Texas at Austin</a> and at <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/03/stanford-libraries-preserves-historical-software-collection-federal-agency">Stanford</a>. Public libraries so not tend to have research collections, preferring to  either use video games strictly for events or to have a circulating collection where you check out current games like any other video or music media.</p>

<p>I asked Dave about the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware">Internet Archive's online gaming collection</a>, and especially about the role of emulation in preserving games. He told me that emulation does not preserve original game play, especially the ergonomics of controllers. Playing on original game hardware with original video hardware gives you an accurate rendition of original game play experience. (Besides, you can't play <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005840579">Duck Hunt</a> without an old fashioned TV because the game depends on sensing the scan lines on the TV.) Some old games are very hard to enjoy on original hardware and the limitations of the controls, not the game itself, are what trips up your enjoyment.</p>

      <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Tasty_Green_Cafe">Tasty Green Cafe</a> inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment).</p>

<p>Lunch (a meat pie and a coke) was $5.01. </p>

<p>I talked briefly with City Attorney <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Stephen_Postema">Stephen Postema</a> and his thoughts on proposed FOIA legislation coming from Lansing (he's skeptical). I told him about my new <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/11/welcome-to-foia-friday.html">FOIA Friday column on Damn Arbor</a>, and he recognized Damn Arbor because it once wrote about his <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2011/04/what-if-anything-is-hipster.html">status as a hipster</a> (he's not).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222614&amp;GUID=3890EFBC-18C0-4B89-A44B-B72A3143DAD5&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting agenda</a> for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.</p>

<p>As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/13/nov-18-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a>. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/repeal_of_ann_arbors_controver.html">Ann Arbor News story</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.m. it's not on the agenda, but Ann Arbor News reporter Ryan Stanton suggests on twitter that the disposition of the Old Y Lot may make it onto the agenda tonight, with council asked to accept the Dahlmann bid. 5:05 p.m. Now on the PDF agenda as "DC-4 13-1467 Resolution to Approve Sale of City-Owned Property at 350 S. Fifth to Dennis A. Dahlmann (8 Votes Required)".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Word is that Dennis Dahlmann has accepted all of the city&#39;s terms and Y Lot sales agreement could be voted on tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=hash">#a2council</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Stanton (@ryanjstanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton/statuses/402543766415757312">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This will be the first meeting for new City Council member Jack Eaton, who defeated Twenty Pound Carp in the general election in November 2013.</p>

<p>Council will appoint a Mayor Pro Tem, to serve as acting Mayor when there is no mayor available. Traditionally this has gone to the most senior member of council by tenure, and I think that might be Margie Teall; the Chronicle hints that Jane Lumm might have the nod.</p>

<p>MC-1 Mayoral appointments look uncontroversial.</p>

<p>PH-1, B-1 "Pizza in the park", a waiver of fees for parks activities that provide basic human services, looks like it's likely to pass based on last week's discussion.</p>

<p>PH-2, B-2 "DDA Revisions" is probably going to take a long time, as various members of council try to make political points regarding the relative balance of services between the downtown and the neighborhoods. Make popcorn.</p>

<p>CA-1 "The Puck Drops Here" is a 31 December 2013 event (details?) to be held just before the 1 January 2014 Winter Classic NHL hockey game.</p>

<p>CA-2 "Hockey is just like football" as far as parking restrictions and street closings goes.</p>

<p>CA-3 Dawn Farm has agreed to acquire 618 N. Main from Avalon Housing.</p>

<p>DC-1 "Ypsi Township on AAATA board" Council gets to decide whether Ypsilanti Township has a seat on the AAATA transit authority board. It was a matter of controversy when it came up the first time; keep up with the popcorn.</p>

<p>DC-4 "Dahlmann proposal for Old Y Lot" This showed up on the agenda at the last possible moment, to the point where it's not clear that members of council will get a chance to read it before voting on it; certainly no one had a chance to put their name in for public commentary on this item. I'm hopeful that this resolution will be postponed until next time for a vote.</p>

<p>DS-2, DS-3, DS-4 Easement swaps with the University of Michigan for a new conduit through the Arboretum, and a new survey to settle a disputed boundary between the city and the university. </p>

<p>G-1. The Greenbelt Advisory Commission has minutes to approve from 2011 (!!!).</p>

<p>G-2. The Public Art Commission has minutes to approve from January and Feburary 2012 (!!!)</p>

<p>G-6, G-7, G-8, G-9 The Taxicab board has been very slow to produce minutes; these date back to January 2013.</p>

<p>Not on the agenda yet is a possible purchase agreement for the "Old Y Lot".</p>

<p>Many further details about the devastation of Haiyan (Yolanda) on the Philippines can be found in the <a href="http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Typhoon_Haiyan_2">Al Jazeera live blog Typhoon Haiyan Live</a>. As of 10 November 2013 there are reported estimates of the dead as a result of this storm exceeding 10,000 people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there have been preliminary estimates of 10,000 dead in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. "Local government officials think the number could reach 20 or 30 thousand people," Al Jazeera's Margot Ortigas reported from Manila.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE: Weather reports from Dr Jeff Masters at <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2576">Weather Underground</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a preliminary death toll of 1,200, Haiyan already ranks as the 8th deadliest typhoon in Philippines history. The deadliest typhoon in Philippines history was Typhoon Thelma of 1991, which killed between 5101 - 8000 people, reports wunderground's weather historian Christopher C. Burt in his latest post on Philippines typhoon history. Haiyan will become the deadest typhoon in Philippines history if the estimates today of 10,000 dead hold up. Bloomberg Industries is estimating insured damages of $2 billion and total economic damages of $14 billion, making Haiyan the most expensive natural disaster in Philippines history. This is the third time in the past 12 months the Philippines have set a new record for their most expensive natural disaster in history. The record was initially set by Typhoon Bopha of December 2012, with $1.7 billion in damage; that record was beaten by the $2.2 billion in damage done by the August 2013 floods on Luzon caused by moisture associated with Typhoon Trami.</p>

<p>Headline: Ludington Daily News, Tuesday, November 11, 1975 via Google News. "Fear all 29 seamen lost / Huge ore carrier is missing on Superior".</p>

<p>From the Downriver <a href="http://thenewsherald.com/articles/2013/11/07/news/doc52794cc957c08958393524.txt">News-Herald</a>, Michigan, news of a <a href="http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald2012.com/index.htm">memorial service in River Rouge</a>:</p>

  <p>A shipwreck that has held the public’s fascination for nearly 40 years will be remembered once again at a memorial service from 6 to 8 p.m. Sunday at Belanger Park (in River Rouge, Michigan).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The worst maritime disaster on the Great Lakes was the wreck of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Milwaukee">SS Milwaukee</a>, a train ferry that sank in 1929 in Lake Michigan off Milwaukee with the loss of all 52 men on board.</p>

<p>The Toronto based trio called the <a href="http://www.fadingwaysmusic.com/theSinTones.html">Sin-Tones</a> have a 1:51 version of Gordon Lightfoot's Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald ballad, done surf-rock style.</p>

<p>Former Milwaukee Brewers executive Edmund Bacon Fitzgerald, known as "Younger Ed" to distinguish him from his father, died in September 2013 at the age of 87. Fitzgerald helped bring baseball back to Milwaukee in 1970 after the departure of the Braves; the ship was named after his father, an executive with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. The <a href="http://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/545/article/p2p-77327418/">Chicago Tribune</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the 30th anniversary of the wreck in 2005, he recalled meeting Lightfoot at a dinner hosted by the Canadian prime minister in the 1980s.  "I told him what my name was, and he looked rather surprised," Fitzgerald said of the Canadian singer-songwriter. Fitzgerald called Lightfoot's homage to the ship a "fine song."</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Because of the election on Tuesday 5 November 2013, the Ann Arbor City Council will be meeting on Thursday 7 November 2013. Here's a preview of sorts of the agenda. Note that the agenda is subject to change up until the very last minute, though in general it stabilizes well before that.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/04/nov-7-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a> is well worth a read.</p>

<p>The agenda, in order, noting only interesting items. Your idea of what is interesting may differ. This posting may be updated from time to time as more details emerge.</p>

<p>MC-1, Mayoral appointments. Nothing obviously controversial here. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Cyndi_Clark">Cyndi Clark</a> is proposed to fill a vacancy on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ann_Arbor_DDA">Ann Arbor DDA</a> board; she's the owner of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Lily_Grace">Lily Grace</a>.</p>

<p>B-1. DDA Ordinance. Four items of substance in the proposed revision (as of v3): 1) Remove the mayor from the DDA board as of the end of the current mayor's term, and replace with the city administrator. 2) Recalculate TIF funding mechanism and the return of surplus funds to taxing entities.  3) "Requires a nexus between development programs and specifically benefited properties within the downtown development district." 4) Requires TIF report in January, and requires DDA programs to be part of the city's Capital Improvement Project (CIP) process. Expect this to take a long time to sort out.</p>

<p>C-1. "Pizza in the Park". Changes the Parks ordinance to omit fees for events "where the permitted event's primary proposed activity is the charitable distribution of goods for basic human needs." Permits are still required.</p>

<p>DC-1. "Stadium Billboard". Directs the city administrator to complain to the University of Michigan about the new digital billboard on E Stadium Blvd near Michigan Stadium.</p>

<p>DC-3. "Ethics". Directs the city administrator and city attorney to educate city council on professional conduct, and directs the Council Rules Committee to draft standards of conduct.</p>

<p>DS-10. Design the Scio Church Road sidewalk, $35,000 from general fund.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wayne County officials expect to see money Wednesday from a Texas doctor who won a tax-foreclosure auction for the Packard Plant, but acknowledge they’re concerned about a statement released by her staff that likened Detroit’s potential to hydroelectric power.</p>
  
  <p>“It is the process that allows us to transform the lake from a canoeing and fishing kind of place into an energy producing kind of place,” reads a three-page statement from Dr. Jill Van Horn’s staff that was released to the media on Tuesday. “Detroit’s assets, like energy, also have a dormant value.”</p>

  <p>Reached by phone Tuesday night, suburban Dallas family doctor Jill Van Horn said she and her investors have the $6 million that she bid for the property and she intended to come to Detroit to create jobs by investing in the site as a manufacturing plant.</p>
  
  <p>She confirmed her group released the three-page statement Tuesday afternoon. The document, full of typos and titled “The Posential Energy in Detroits Assets,” contains nonsensical passages about her group’s plans for the plant and other vacant properties in Detroit. It mentions Van Horn’s “prophecy” to “resurrect Detroit.”</p>

<p>What detaches value from a simple old plant such as Packard and fixes Detroiters to realize it as capital?</p>

<p>We can begin to finally answer by using an energy analogy that was put forth by Hernando Deesoto.</p>

<p>Consider Mountain Lake we can think about this lake in its immediate physical context and see come primary use for it such as canoeing and fishing.</p>

<p>But when we think about this same lake as an engineer would, by focusing on its capacity to generate energy as an additional value beyond the lakes natural state as a body of water. We suddenly see the potential created by the lakes elevated position. The challenge for the engineer, is the same challenge that all Detroiters face today, finding out how he can create a process that allows him to convert and fix this potential into a form that can be used to do additional work. IN the case of the elevated lake, that process is contained in a hydroelectric plant that allows the lake water to move rapidly downward with the force of gravity. Thereby transforming the placid lakes potential into the kinetic energy of tumbling water. This electric magnets that further convert into electrical energy.</p>

<p>As electricity, the potential energy of the Placid Lake is now fixed in the form necessary to produce controllable current that can be further transmitted through wire conductors in faraway places to display new production. Apparently Placid Lake can be used to light your room and power the machinery in a factory.</p>

<p>What was required was an external man made process that allowed us, first, to identify the weight of the water, second, convert this potential energy into electricity, which can then be used to create surplus value. The additional value we obtain form the lake I not the value of the lake itself, but rather the value of the manmade process intricate of the lake.</p>

<p>It is the process that allows us to transform the lake form a canoeing and fishing kind of place into an energy producing kind of place. Detroit's assets, like energy, also have a dormant value.</p>

<p>Bringing them to life requires Detroiters to go beyond looking at the city's asset as they are actively thinking about them as they could be.</p>

<p>It required a sophisticated process for fixing Detroit's assets economical potential into a form that can be used to make additional production. Although the process to convert the potential energy in the water into electricity is well known. The one that gives Detroit's assets the form required to put in motion. More production is not known, in other words while we know that it is the pin stop, turbaned, generators, transformers, and wires of the hydro-electric energy system, that convert the potential energy of the lake until it is fixed in a accessible form. We do not know where to find the key process that connects the economic potential of that Detroiters can benefit from.</p>

<p>This is because that key process has never been deliberately set up for Detroiters. Under the development plans that Jill Van Horn has co designed for Detroit. The city will develop through a variety of financial mechanisms that gradually will combine into a process that will churn out capital as never before.</p>

<p>Although the Japanese, Chinese and our financiers on Wall Street use their mechanisms all the time. Detroiters do not realize that none of the essential capital generating functions is being utilized in their area. Historically Detroiters used them as parts of the Banking and Financial system, but not as interlocking mechanism for fixing the economic potential of Detroit's assets in such a way that they can be converted into capital for all Detroiters benefit.</p>

<p>This may sound complex, but consider the Penobscot building that sold for approximately
5 million dollars, but contains more than 1,000,000 square feet of luxurious office space. Then consider single family housing selling for $1,000.00 which contained more than 1,600 square feet. Then consider entire city block that are being sold for 100.00 a lot, further consider the millions of square feet in apartment buildings scattered throughout the city. Finally consider the fact that Detroit is in Bankruptcy and so is its sister city Hyland Park.</p>

<p>Now is not the time for native Detroiters to bicker over the price of the Packard Plant. Now is the time to form a coalition made of past and future developers in order to make a change in Detroit. Utilizing the private investors, the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, International Bankers, and Faith Based Organizations located through the city to pull it up by its boot straps and make it whole again.</p>

<p>Dr Van Horn has assembled the investment Bankers, Hedge Fund Lenders, Private Investors and several Foundations, who intend to merge their financial resources with the local developers in Detroit, to transform the dormant capital the lies in every real estate parcel in the city of Detroit, into a fixed value of capital that will benefit all of the cities residence.</p>

<p>Prior to placing the bid on the Packard Plant, Dr. Van Horn's prophecy was to resurrect Detroit by providing education, jobs and vocational training to the city's residence, simultaneously unplugging the financial arteries of the city.</p>

<p>That decision was based on the gravity of the hour and the magnitude of potential jobs that the plant offers for the people of Detroit.</p>

<p>"Any intelligent foal can make things bigger, more complex and more violent. it takes a touch of genius-- and a let of courage to move in the opposite direction." Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Dr. Van Horn's partners consist of all af the non--profit developers who elther own land or have designated development areas within the city. Furthermore, if the county doubts that we have the ability to perform, we challenge the caunty by stating at this time, Dr. Van Horn and her lenders, investors are prepared to travel fram Texas to Detroit and sit down with the county and make an offer for every vacant, abandoned and dilapidated apartment building within Detroit. Not only are we prepared to show that we have the ability to perform, but we are ready to perform.</p>

<p>2012 was a disaster for Michigan apple growers, but 2013 has been a good year. From <a href="http://www.capitalpress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131024/ARTICLE/131029937">Capital Press</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.</p>
  
  <p>Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.</p>
  
  <p>“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the limiting factors in the apple harvest is the availability of seasonal workers to pick the crop. Last year was a bad year and some migrants resettled to other states. From <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/michigan_apple_crop_migrant_wo.html">MLive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market demand also will play a role in determining how many apples are left in the fields or sent to packers and processors, said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee that represents some 850 family-owned orchards.</p>
  
  <p>Smith estimates the apple harvest workforce is short about 20 percent. Labor has been the industry's top concern for many years, since it's tough to find an adequate skilled workforce, she said, adding that immigration policies that allow migrant workers to go back and forth between the U.S. and their home countries would help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://record-eagle.com/latest-mobile/x1909741911/Migrant-worker-shortage-hits-orchards-in-Traverse-City-area/print">Traverse City Record-Eagle</a> notes the impact in the northwestern part of the Lower Peninsula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some affected growers, particularly in the Grand Rapids area, are prioritizing and picking only varieties that have the best financial return, said Jim Bardenhagen, an area fruit and vegetable farmer and retired 20-year Leelanau County extension director.</p>
  
  <p>Bardenhagen said several area farmers told him that only about half of migrant workers needed to pick apples in the region came to northwestern lower Michigan this year and that many are new to the work. He personally lost only one worker in his crew of three. Area crews generally can vary from about five to 30.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be a good year to look for orchards that are doing a gleaner's harvest to donate to local food banks.</p>

  <p>While I deeply appreciate city council's dedication to a balanced budget and basic services, we cannot simply save our way to success. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Pfizer">Post-Pfizer</a>, Ann Arbor must increase its tax base by supporting a strong and diversified economy of high-growth, high tech companies.</p>

<p>Borders was an Ann Arbor based bookstore that grew from a single store into a worldwide bookselling leader. It closed its doors in 2011 after 40 years in business. This <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/12/first.borders.bookstore.closing/index.html">CNN story</a> gives a good history of its rise and fall. <a href="http://literatibookstore.com/">Literati Bookstore</a> is an independent bookstore that opened in Ann Arbor in 2013, inheriting several former Borders employees and a number of its bookshelves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As CEO of a fast-growing high tech company, and mentor and advisor to many other innovative, venture-backed startups here, I can personally testify to the challenges of building a company downtown. All of my prior companies have been split between Ann Arbor and elsewhere, with most of their economic impact (hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs, services, investment, and spin-offs) outside of Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of Dug's prior companies was <a href="http://arbornetworks.com">Arbor Networks</a>, which split itself between Ann Arbor and the Boston area. Arbor was <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2010-press-releases/1994-tektronix-communications-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbor-networks">acquired in 2010</a> by Tektronix Communications, a division of Danaher. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to see us reverse that trend. We have had far too many world-changing technology companies start in Ann Arbor, but leave to grow their people and fortunes elsewhere. It's often for the most mundane of reasons that 20- and 30-somethings here understand all too well.</p>
  
  <p>We need a city council that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, open governance, and good kindergarten skills, but also promotes a vision of positive growth for our community. In today's economy, if we aren't busy growing, we're just slowly dying, and I've been terrified by the Tea Party-like obstructionism I've seen from council members on issues of development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The "Tea Party" label has been applied to opponents on City Council before, most notably via the anonymous weblog "Middle of the Left" which uses the term <a href="http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/">Teapublicans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this reason, I support Kirk Westphal, Democratic candidate in Ward 2 for Ann Arbor city council. His vision of a vital, walkable downtown supporting diversity, density, and dynamism is a recipe for <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/">placemaking</a>, and a natural engine for economic growth. We need downtown Ann Arbor to be a real place again and not just a hollowed-out franchise of Traverse City minus the bay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reference to "franchise of Traverse City" alludes to several TC based businesses that have set up shop in Ann Arbor, including Cherry Republic and the restaurants Blue Tractor and Jolly Pumpkin.</p>

  <p>A vote for Kirk is a vote for progress!</p>

  <p>How did my WILD Saturday night OFF WORK go? Celebrated my friend's, Sarita LH,birthday who is a medic as well with my other awesome medic buddy Tim Skeeters at Rush Street in Ann Arbor. While we were having a great time, 2 gun shots were fired on the dance floor. While everyone stampeded away from the dance floor, we rushed towards it. Before we can think twice we were atop the shooter and the victim. As far as the gentleman who was shot in the abdomen, he with conscious and alert with 2 other great medics stopping the bleeding and keeping him awake. We, then successfully backboarded and loaded the patient. Literally 2 hours later my shift began and now back at work, however getting paid for it this time. </p>

Savvy investors are getting information from government records to help them make decisions before the information is widely known in the market. "One firm, FOI Services Inc., accounted for about 10% of the 50,000 information requests sent to the FDA during the period examined by the Journal."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A review by The Wall Street Journal of more than 100,000 of the roughly three million FOIA requests filed over the past five years, including all of those sent to the FDA, shows that investors use the process to troll for all kinds of information. They ask the Environmental Protection Agency about pollution regulations, the Department of Energy about grants for energy-efficient vehicles, and the Securities and Exchange Commission about whether publicly held companies are under investigation. Such requests are perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Sam Kriss has a wonderful <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/book-of-lamentations/">reading of the psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-5</a>, treating it as a dystopian novel. In the "Book of Lamentations", he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something has gone terribly wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any real fulfillment. The newly published DSM-5 is a classic dystopian novel in this mold.</p>
  
  <p>It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an unwieldy mouthful: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The author (or authors) writes under the ungainly nom de plume of The American Psychiatric Association – although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone; within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd, chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As sent to the Ann Arbor City Clerk, 23 October 2013:</p>

<p>To the clerk:</p>

<p>The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended
discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council
weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to
spend money to replace them.</p>

<p>To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at
council about the state of the lighting, I'd like to make this
request.</p>

<p>Please provide the following records:</p>

<ol>
<li>The most recent inspection and safety reports for the eighty one
(81) street lighting poles referenced in City Council item 13-1062
that were proposed to be replaced, referencing the following Whereas
clause:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas: The Street Lights along Main Street between Huron and
  William are rusting at the base posing a safety issue and are in need
  of replacement; "</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this request is in the public interest, and since the records
have been freshly examined for staff preparation for council, I expect
that the records will be readily available at no charge.</p>

<p>I do not know if the records are in electronic form. If they are in
paper form, and if duplication of records would be necessary to
fulfill this request, please inform me before proceeding so that I can
weigh the costs. If possible, if the records are in paper form I would
like to examine them in person to avoid unnecessary costs.</p>

<p>Thanks for your prompt response to this request.</p>

<p>The apple crop in SE Michigan is exceptionally good this year, after last year's horrible crop. From <a href="http://www.goodfruit.com/Good-Fruit-Grower/Web-2013/Large-US-apple-crop-forecast/">GoodFruit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, Michigan produced only 2.7 million bushels of apples, a tenth of a normal crop. This year, the Guesstimate was for a crop of 26.3 million bushels, a number only surpassed once in the last eight years. Michigan’s crop has been highly variable for the last decade, but averages around 20 million bushels.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor City Council decided not to spend general fund money on downtown Ann Arbor street lamps, after inspection of the lamps showed that some of them were rusting at the base. I filed a FOIA request to get recent safety inspection reports.</p>

<p>As usual, the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/10/20/oct-21-2013-ann-arbor-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a> is a useful guide to the details, and the <a href="https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222612&amp;GUID=EBFC5C3E-0504-4B72-95C6-12815612D619&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting details from Legistar</a> give you the play-by-play.</p>

<p>The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site. Keystone won the RFP, beating out Flight Plan Creative of Traverse City ($24,650) and B+B Marketing Communications of Midland ($40,000). It is to be noted that the award did not go to the low bidder, as the qualifications for the RFP spelled out that price was not the only consideration for the bid.</p>

<p>Ypsilanti Township is seeking to join The Ride (The Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority, or AAATA). Vivienne Armentrout has posted an <a href="http://localinannarbor.com/2013/10/19/once-again-aaata-exceeds-its-reach/">article critical of the expansion</a> which drew a stern rebuke from Larry Krieg of Ypsi Township:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an era when we can’t afford either to isolate our communities or to link them solely by private automobiles, the clear path to prosperity in Michigan is through regional cooperation and investing together in alternative forms of transportation. We can’t afford <em>not</em> to make this investment now. Those who think it’s foolish to diversify our transportation options are neglecting the huge expense of our current dependence on automobiles and petroleum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm all for improved service to Ypsilanti Township, but that's at least a little selfish. If service to that part of the area improves, it will be in part due to improvements in service on AAATA Route 5, which goes right by my house. If I lived on the west side of Ann Arbor, I'd be agitating for Scio Township to buy in to transit improvements, because that would likely add to the quality of service of west-side bus routes.</p>

<p>What's not on the agenda is perhaps as important as what's on the agenda. This week's agenda as printed Sunday night does not have any talk of a repeal of the city crosswalk ordinance. That's been getting a lot of press, including this <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/10/stay-vigilant-for-coming-attacks-on.html">piece in Damn Arbor</a> suggesting additional signage to improve motorist recognition of local ordinances. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/10/efforts_underway_to_repeal_ann_arbors_crosswalk_ordinance.html">dot News story</a> suggests that a motion to repeal the ordinance might be on the council's November agenda, perhaps after the elections when there's new faces on the council.</p>

<p>As always, <a href="http://a2gov.org/ctn">CTN</a> is your source for online city council video, and the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council">a2council</a> hash tag on Twitter can help you follow along with the play by play.</p>

      <p>Bush fires are burning in New South Wales, Australia in October 2013. If you are near the fire, you must find a more accurate and timely source of information than this blog post.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24575830">BBC report</a> quotes from a local official:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minister for Police and Emergency Services Michael Gallacher told the BBC that "the speed and the ferocity" of the fires was something "not seen for many, many years".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of this writing, the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/more-than-100-homes-destroyed-conditions-set-to-worsen-20131018-2vshk.html">Sydney Morning Herald report</a> is that more than 100 homes have been lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alongside him on Sunny Ridge Road, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes the epic scale of these fires: 86,000 hectares burnt; fire perimeters stretching 400 to 500 kilometres; 94 fires still burning at 2.20pm, 27 uncontained and two with emergency warnings, one on the central coast and one nearby, threatening Springwood High School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google's <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-nsw-bushfires">crisis map of the New South Wales fires</a> is a mirror of the <a href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?CAT_ID=683">New South Wales Rural Fire Service map</a>. The original map is easier to use if you know the names of the fire locations, but the Google map has a few more overlays that can be helpful.</p>

<p>The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press (<a href="http://www.rcfp.org">RCFP</a>) announced a new FOIA generator and FOIA request tracker, "iFOIA", at the ONA '13 conference. From their <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-committee-launches-ifoia-electronic-information-request-filing-and-tracking-system">press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iFOIA resource, which is online at <a href="http://www.ifoia.org">www.ifoia.org</a>, is an extension of the Reporters Committee’s popular FOIA Letter Generator, which has been a feature of the organization’s website since 1996. iFOIA can be used on a desktop or mobile device, and allows users to choose whether to keep their correspondence chains with government agencies confidential or share them with designated colleagues, such as editors and lawyers. It also includes a FOIA Wiki for feedback and discussions. Because it automatically organizes all of a reporter’s files, it is designed to help with lawsuits and agency appeals when government stonewalling presents no other option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sent my first request in this morning, a straightforward one that shouldn't require any payment or any appeal, and I'm hopeful that it will work as easily as it seems to work. The site is in beta.</p>

<p>The other FOIA request system to compare it with is the now-venerable <a href="http://www.muckrock.com">Muckrock</a>, which does a similar task. The biggest visible difference with Muckrock is that the iFOIA site doesn't appear to have a one-step straightforward way to share your FOIA request and results with the world. Muckrock serves as both a request and publication platform, and seems to be tuned to publicity and activism; the RCFP system looks like it's designed more for the journalist keeping their work private until it shows up in print.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's more like "inbox three" than "inbox zero" because of a couple of persistent stuck messages, and the todo list is full of items that I put on it ten months ago that still need to be done. That said, I'm still happy with my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">issuetracker system</a>, for which I'm using <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">Github's issues system</a> as a personal productivity tool. It has a long memory, it's reliable, and the mobile tools for managing lists work nicely on my Android phone.</p>

<p>The one thing I'm not completely happy with is how to make sure that things that need to get done every week are done promptly on time. My calendar is not quite a strong enough reminder, and it's not sane to do a todo item every single week for routine events. For daily medication reminders, I've found that <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">Medhelper</a> is single-focused and detailed enough to work well.</p>

<p>The first <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/11/addtodo_a_simpl.html">todo list code</a> I released to the net was back in 2005, and it had the feature of being completely manageable from the command line and capable of generating a random task. It looks like it's possible that I could install <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-hub">ingy's git-hub tool</a> and have things work that way again.</p>

  <p>Affinia Group Inc., a firm that designs, manufactures, distributes and markets industrial grade products and services, will relocate its Ann Arbor, Mich., headquarters to Gastonia, home of its Global Filtration group.
  The transition to the new corporate headquarters will occur in phases during 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia gives a little background</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Affinia Group, a motor industry company, was formed in 2004 and specializes in the design, manufacture and replacement of parts for and on and off-road vehicles. Specifically filtration and chassis components.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gastongazette.com/spotlight/affinia-group-moving-headquarters-to-gastonia-1.218940">Gaston Gazette</a> has additional details -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Affinia has approximately 50 jobs at its current headquarters, but that doesn’t mean all those jobs will relocate here. “We’re still putting together the transition plan,” said Keith Wilson, president of WIX Global Filtration. “It’s more of a consolidation than it is a big addition of people.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/outside_the_loop/2013/10/affinia-group-to-move-headquarters-to.html">Charlotte Business Journal</a> points to a new CFO at Affinia as an impetus for the move:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It all started in December, when Affinia spun off its brakes unit that makes Raybestos brand of automobile brakes. That unit, called <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brake-parts-inc-is-back-199857601.html">Brake Parts Inc.</a>, was sold to members of Affinia’s brakes unit management team. The price of the deal for Brake Parts, which contributed one-third of Affinia’s sales in 2011, wasn’t disclosed. Then on Monday, Affinia announced it had hired a Charlotte executive, Steve Klueg, as its new chief financial officer. Klueg, CFO at ReCommunity Recycling in Charlotte, will stay in the Charlotte area after he replaces Thomas Madden at Affinia, Howat says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thomas Madden, the former Affinia CFO, is retiring, notes <a href="http://www.aftermarketnews.com/Item/119412/affinia_group_cfo_tom_madden_announces_retirement.aspx">Aftermarket News</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Tom Madden has almost 40 years of financial leadership to our company, and his guidance has been an immeasurable ingredient in helping us achieve our status as a worldwide leader," said Terry McCormack, president and CEO of Affinia Group. "In a continuing demonstration of the commitment he has shown throughout his career, Tom will work side by side with our incoming CFO Steve Klueg to seamlessly transfer financial leadership over the coming months."</p>

<h2>DTE Energy addresses temporary lighting failure at Comerica Park</h2>

<p>DETROIT, Oct. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy's preliminary investigation of the temporary lighting failure that occurred at Comerica Park during Major League Baseball's American League Championship Series (ALCS), has found there was a cable failure in the area near the stadium, which caused the problem.</p>

<p>The lights in the stadium were out for approximately 20 minutes beginning at approximately 4:41 p.m. Power was restored in the stadium at around 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The cable failure caused a voltage reduction, which tripped the lights in the stadium. The momentary sag in voltage was an isolated incident.</p>

<p>DTE Energy maintains two independent electrical feeds for precisely this kind of an event. Both feeds to the park continued to provide power during the incident.</p>

<p>"We've identified the cause of the disturbance and we worked with officials at Comerica Park to resolve the issue quickly," said Steve Kurmas, President and Chief Operating Officer for DTE Electric, a unit of DTE Energy. "We regret the interruption."</p>

<p>DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Its operating units include an electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan and a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church of San Pedro in Loboc is the second oldest church in Bohol. It was originally built in 1602, but soon reduced to ashes. In 1638, a stronger one was built. Located near the river, it has survived a number of floods. Inside the church, you can admire some remarkable naive paintings on the ceiling. A Spanish coat of arms can be found in the stone wall near the entrance of the convent. The bell tower of Loboc is about 100 meters from the church.</p>

      <p>Our local Caribou Coffee closed its doors for the last time on Sunday. A trailer appeared in the front of it Monday sporting a Peet's logo. The effort to rebuild the corner coffee shop under a new name is expected to take a couple of weeks, with a planned opening date in mid-November.</p>

<p>Change is hard, and change in a coffee routine is doubly hard. The corner Caribou had been a study spot, a meeting place, a second office and a place to see Mike the Mailman. Can we count on Peet's to fill the same neighborhood niche? Only time will tell.</p>

  <p>Update:   Xerox Resolves EBT System Outage.
  Beneficiary access to programs such as SNAP, TANF, and other programs has been restored to the 17 States where Xerox provides EBT service.  Re-starting the EBT system required time to ensure service was back at full functionality.  Beneficiaries who required immediate access to their benefits could work with their local merchants who could activate an emergency voucher process where available. We appreciate our clients’ patience while we resolved this issue and apologize for any inconvenience. We realize that access to these benefits is important to families in the states we serve. We continue to investigate the cause of the issue so we can take steps to ensure a similar interruption does not re-occur.</p>

<p>A statement received via email from <a href="http://news.xerox.com/contacts">Karen Arena</a>, Xerox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a routine test of our back-up systems Saturday morning,  Xerox’s Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system experienced a temporary shutdown. While the system is now up and running, beneficiaries in the 17 affected states continue to experience connectivity issues to access their benefits. This disruption impacts EBT beneficiaries who rely on the system for SNAP and WIC. Technical staff is addressing the issue and expect the system to be restored soon.  Beneficiaries requiring access to their benefits can work with their local retailers who can activate an emergency voucher system where available. We appreciate our clients’ patience while we work through this outage as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Problems-With-EBT-Systems--227518221.html">NBC Philadelphia</a> has a quote from the vendor ACS, a division of Xerox.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sheree Powell, Director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, also told NBC10 affiliate KFOR that the system failure is the result of a power outage at a Xerox facility. EBT cards in several states are powered by a company that Xerox owns called ACS, Inc.
  "We are getting updated in real time," said <a href="http://news.xerox.com/contacts">Karen Arena</a>, a spokeswoman for Xerox. "But as far as I know right now some of the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system is experiencing temporary connectivity issues. Technical staff is addressing the issue and expect the system to be restored soon. The issue stemmed from a routine check of the system."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia Bryan, public information officer for the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the problems stemmed from a power outage at the main data center for Xerox, the vendor for EBT cards in Mississippi and 16 other states across the nation. The outage caused equipment problems that led to cards being declined at stores across the state. Bryan said Xerox reported that the issue should be resolved shortly, but no specific time frame was available. "This has nothing to do with the federal government shutdown," Bryan said.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm putting together a few mobile apps (in the form of mobile web sites) that are designed for small-screen phone use. Here's what's in the works. Each of these are likely to change over time, so don't get too fond of anything just yet.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/a2trees.html">a2trees</a> app provides some kind of on-the-go listing of street trees in Ann Arbor that are interesting. The observation that there is a great apple crop in 2013 and that there are city trees laden with nice apples just waiting to be picked was the motivation. It's really bare-bones now, with not more more in the way of detail than my old <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/07/amelanchier-shadbush-juneberry-sugar-plum-inventory-for-ann-arbor-2009.html">juneberry listing</a> post, except neatly set up for mobile use.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/m/index.html">mobile web</a> app is self-referential in that it tries to collect useful bookmarks to mobile-ready versions of things like newspaper, bus, weather, netnews, and other web pages specially formatted for mobile use. I got tired of typing in the URL to fetch the bus listing so I put it on a menu. This is an up-to-dated version of the list I kept of <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~emv/m/">mobile sites on monkey.org</a> dating back about 5 years from when I had a Blackberry and was collecting same. The project is <a href="http://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">up on Github</a> (and has been for the past 5 years!) but there's not much more to look at than data. Please do feel free to give me feedback there as well as here.</p>

<p>Finally two power outage related mobile sites. The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index.html">mobile power outage maps</a> collection is a slow but sure approach to turning my popular <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">power outage maps</a> blog post into something more tidy for the small screen. The state it's in is functional but not complete, and I expect I'll chip away at it as storms or outages warrant. A second and new app for me is a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/power-outage-maps/index-ziplookup.html">utility company finder</a> site that takes as its input the first three digits of a zip code and returns the utility companies that serve that area, or type the utility name and get back a list of 3-digit zips it serves. The big caveats on this are that it's slow, slow, slow, and that the data set it's derived from is nominally from 2011 but shows many signs of not being kept up to date with utility mergers and name changes since then.</p>

<p>All of these "mobile" things are browser-based right now, so you can try them from whatever system you are likely to be typing at. They use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> for the fancy bits, and I'm pretty happy so far in just how far I get with that system using HTML do to the work and not having to write a bunch of Javascript to get things to work. On the server side I have been generating these as static sites using old-fashioned Unix shell scripts and makefiles, and though it's not elegant by any means, it is well within exactly the kind of coding environment I've been using since the 1980s.</p>

<p>Let's start with the lead of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/08/230486409/amidst-big-salmonella-outbreak-usda-says-it-s-on-the-job?sc=tw&amp;cc=share">NPR story</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a health alert warning that an estimated 278 illnesses caused by Salmonella Heidelberg are associated with raw chicken produced by Foster Farms at three facilities in California.</p>
  
  <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says illnesses have been reported in 17 states, with the vast majority — 78 percent — in California. The outbreak is ongoing, so it's possible that people are still being sickened by the chicken.</p>
  
  <p>The CDC says about 42 percent of the people who've gotten sick (among those for whom information is available) have been hospitalized. The strains of Salmonella Heidelberg that have made people sick are resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. And according to the CDC, the resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or make the illness tougher to treat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This public health alert is being issued after an estimated 278 illnesses were recently reported in 18 states, predominantly in California.  The outbreak is continuing. The investigations indicate that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken and other brand chicken produced at Foster Farms plants are the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg infections. Illnesses were linked to Foster Farms brand chicken through epidemiologic, laboratory and traceback investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS continues its investigation.</p>

<p>and from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html">CDC's MMWR report</a>, a case count and map -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of October 7, 2013, a total of 278 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella Heidelberg have been reported from 17 states. Most of the ill persons (77%) have been reported from California. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (2), Arkansas (1), Arizona (11), California (213), Colorado (4), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (2), Michigan (2), North Carolina (1), Nevada (8), Oregon (8), Texas (5), Utah (2), Washington (15) and Wisconsin (1).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/270175/2/Salmonella-outbreak-in-18-states-including-Michigan">WZZM / USA Today</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CDC has been hampered in tracing the outbreak because the government shutdown meant the agency had to shut down PulseNet, a national network of public health laboratories that looks for trends and matches reports to spot food-borne illness outbreaks. It's one of the agency's most important tools in detecting such problems.</p>
  
  <p>"We were trying to do this without the automatic system, and it was nearly impossible," Reynolds said. Seven of the eight staffers who run the system were furloughed. "We were doing it by hand, and it just become untenable."</p>
  
  <p>CDC director Thomas Frieden determined that not having PulseNet was resulting in "an imminent threat to health and safety," a finding that allowed the agency to bring back the seven staffers, Reynolds said Tuesday. "It's back up and running as of today."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More about <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/">PulseNet</a> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PulseNet compares the 'DNA fingerprints' of bacteria from patients to find clusters of disease that might represent unrecognized outbreaks. Health officials can't stop an outbreak, and industry and regulatory agencies can't make changes to our food and water delivery systems, if they don't know that outbreaks are occurring. That's where PulseNet comes in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does <a href="http://fosterfarms.com/faq/faqfoodsafety.asp">Foster Farms have to say</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Salmonella is naturally occurring in poultry and can be fully eradicated if raw product is properly handled and fully cooked,” said Dr. Robert O’Connor, the company’s food safety chief and head veterinarian. “All poultry producers strive to reduce bacterial presence, including Salmonella. We take food safety very seriously. When the incidence of illnesses linked to Salmonella increased, we wanted to know why and we have worked quickly to identify and implement additional controls. It is also important to reassure the public that the FSIS process has not been affected by the recent government shutdown.”</p>

<p>Notably they also emphasize, in red:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No Recall is in Effect. Products are Safe to Consume if Properly Handled and Fully Cooked.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">Healthcare.GOV</a>, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-06 at 10.31.25 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affd2204f970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/05/us-usa-healthcare-technology-analysis-idUSBRE99407T20131005">Reuters took a look at the issue</a>, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. For instance, when a user tries to create an account on HealthCare.gov, which serves insurance exchanges in 36 states, it prompts the computer to load an unusually large amount of files and software, overwhelming the browser, experts said. If they are right, then just bringing more servers online, as officials say they are doing, will not fix the site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the site took three years to build, it took only a few minutes for it to break down when it went live at 8 a.m. E.D.T. Some consumers said they were met with an error message in the early morning when trying to visit the Web site, which seemed to be overwhelmed with traffic and limited by apparent programming issues. Many people took to Twitter and Facebook to note that the site was down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/04/obamacare-disaster-or-routine-maintenance/">MSNBC asks</a> - disaster or routine maintenance?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HHS officials said that they will be taking down the “application part of the website” for scheduled maintenance this weekend, according to NBC News’ Kristin Welker. The announcement was red meat for critics of Obamacare, who have been largely silent since the health care law rolled out earlier this week. Speaker John Boehner said the administration’s announcement was proof that “the president’s health care law has been an unmitigated disaster.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, no reliable reports that I've been able to find blame the problem on a specific denial of service attack; rather, it appears to be a combination of sudden demand for the service, teething pains for a new site, and system complexity. I did not note any commentary from the Arbor Networks <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/asert/">ASERT</a> weblog, which writes about DDOS attacks. <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/">Renesys</a>, usually a useful view on problems, is reporting on Internet downtime in Sudan and Syria. My heads-up site for Internet-wide problems, the <a href="http://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages">outages mailing list</a>, is silent. Strangely, the place I'd expect to have seen this show up - the automated news aggregator <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/131007/p12#a131007p12">Techmeme</a> - is also quiet (Update: see below for Techmeme coverage). The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/obamacare">Obamacare Reddit subboard</a> has some reports from people who made it through the system, and others who are having problems.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the problems like these are in the software. Hardware is the easy part. You can add more hardware and do it easily. Software takes more time. In the rush of getting this out, it seems like testing wasn’t done completely. My expectations from this is that these problems should go away in the next few weeks. The site still won’t be as fast as something like Netflix, but it should work.</p>

  <p>A resolution that’s been added to the Ann Arbor city council’s Monday, Oct. 7, 2013 agenda would, if approved, result in the waiver of attorney-client privilege with respect to a specific advice memo that has already been written by the city attorney’s office.</p>

<p>The question is about Al McWilliams, who was appointed by the Ann Arbor City Council on a 6-5 vote to join the Ann Arbor DDA; there is consideration that the vote requirement might have been 8 votes. There was talk that the minutes for the previous meeting might be contested as a result.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c" alt="Images" title="Images" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> runs Tor ("The Onion Router"), a network designed to provide its users with anonymity when using the Internet. Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.</p>

<p>Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer. The description of the resources used to take down Silk Road did not mention any specific attacks on Tor; the proprietor of Silk Road left behind enough clues through sloppy tradecraft that it was possible through diligent efforts to identify him based on his public postings. The takedown of Silk Road caused a disturbance in the Force as seen through the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/10/bitcoin-volatility-after-silk-road-shutdown.html">volatility in Bitcoin prices</a> seen right after the system was taken down.</p>

<p>Most recently the Guardian printed a Bruce Schneier piece on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity">Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users' online anonymity</a>. It goes into detail on the flaws in browser implementations that can be used to attack Tor anonymity as well as the peculiar attacks that only the NSA can take out by doing monkey-in-the-middle attacks on the Tor (and Internet) infrastructure. It's a good read, and exposes such lovely NSA code names as "EgotisticalGiraffe".</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Schneier piece is that it's not impossible to unmask the anonymity of Tor users, especially if they are sloppy in any way in their use of the system; there are enough bugs to go around in the components that make up a typical Tor browser bundle that it's likely that a dedicated effort to entrap a specific user will succeed. But it's hard work, and thus the Tor system works as its Naval Intelligence designers intended - only the most determined state actor can foil typical use of the system.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Photo from Berin Szoka, used with permission, shows at center a black car that crashed into a security post after a shooting incident.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc21e3c970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc21e3c970c" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="IMG_20131003_144632_646" title="IMG_20131003_144632_646" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc21e3c970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The best reporting from the Capitol today was from people close enough to the scene to be an eyewitness, yet not trapped in the need as a news organization to put a coherent story around the whole matter until it was well and thoroughly over. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I&#39;m watching the whole thing from my office. The air&#39;s full of gunpowder smoke. It looks like police have the situation under control</p>&mdash; Berin Szoka (@BerinSzoka) <a href="https://twitter.com/BerinSzoka/statuses/385832218381152256">October 3, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Once it was over, you could make out the outlines of a story; as it was happening, it was hard to tell what was really going on, what with a "fog of war" situation and lots of people who weren't anywhere near the scene breathlessly retweeting accounts from other people who also weren't there. There are still loose ends, like the name of the shooter, a confirmation that she is deceased, the identity of a child, and the condition of a police officer in the incident.</p>

<p>Some news clips, for reference:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/gunfire-reported-outside-the-capitol.html">NY Times</a> - "WASHINGTON — The United States Capitol was locked down for about a half-hour on Thursday afternoon after law enforcement officers shot and killed a woman who had been chased there in her car from the White House, law enforcement officials said." </p>

      <p>Frank’s Restaurant is under new management – as of October 1, says the sign. They are advertising extended late night hours.</p>

<p>Frank's is well known as "the fortified high point of Ann Arbor", according to its menus.</p>

<p>I wrote about Frank's 6 years ago as part of a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/placeshout---ht.html">review of Placeshout</a>, which was a simple application for taking short (100 character) notes on locations. That was from the era of the Ann Arbor "nova mob", a cadre of people who could be counted on to use any new social or review site and instantly propel Ann Arbor to the top of the list for cities reviewed, second usually only to San Francisco. Placeshout is gone (without even a goodbye message), and the nova mob has scattered to the winds. But Frank's is still here, and good luck to its new management.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here's a 24 hour snapshot from the <a href="http://bitcoinity.org/markets">Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity</a>. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" title="Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Why the volatility? It turns out that a popular Bitcoin trading site, Silk Road, has been shut down by the Feds. Silk Road was known for its free and easy Bitcoin-fueled trading in drugs, and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002">indictment alleges</a> that the proprietor, a certain Ross William Ulbricht, known as "Dread Pirate Roberts," also used the site to plan a contract "hit" on someone who crossed his path.</p>

<p>Many, many more comments are on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6482992">the Hacker News story</a>, and an account of the Bitcoin volatility in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-bitcoin-idUSL1N0HS1Q820131002">a Reuters followup</a>.</p>

      <p>Michigan Wikipedians is a University of Michigan student association. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan Wikipedians (or MWiki) is a Wikipedia student organization at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The group was the first student Wikipedia club in the United States. The club is open to all students and faculty of the University of Michigan, as well as community members who are interested in Wikipedia. It meets every Monday at 8:00PM at the Language Resource Center in the basement of North Quadrangle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went to an organizing meeting Monday 30 September 2013, here's a few things I saw.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ArborWiki">ArborWiki template</a> on Wikipedia!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use this template to link Wikipedia articles to their ArborWiki counterparts, especially if the ArborWiki articles contain more information (including information of local interest more appropriate to ArborWiki than Wikipedia).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combine this with the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:ArborWiki">pages that link to this template</a> and you get a short list of forward links from Wikipedia to Arborwiki. There's a similar page of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Entries_with_pages_in_Wikipedia">Arborwiki entries with pages in Wikipedia</a> that completes the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikimedia Commons has a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Buildings_in_Ann_Arbor,_Michigan">Buildings in Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> category with more than 100 photos of the area.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to be a member of the Michigan Wikipedians group, simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Michigan_Wikipedians/Members">add your name</a> to the roster of active members.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Meetings are every Monday on the U of Michigan campus. I'm hoping to make it there 2d Mondays - 1st and 3d Mondays are Ann Arbor City Council, and 4th Mondays are a2civictech - and hope to see you there.</p>

  <p>Update 7:27 p.m. The power outage and explosion were due to a power system failure. All are asked to leave the main campus area immediately. For updates call 800-705-9998.</p>
  
  <p>The campus is experiencing a power outage.  All classes this evening are cancelled.  Lab operations should be safely shut down and people should leave the building.  At this time, most major IT services (bspace, bconnected, etc.) are offline. When power returns, these systems will gradually come online. More information will be posted at this location.  For ongoing updates, please call 1-800-705-9998 throughout the evening.</p>
