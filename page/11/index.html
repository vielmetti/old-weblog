There are three types of problems reported by county health. To simplify reporting I score them proportionately to see which locations go to the top of the list. 6 locations had no problems at all:

 “Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-beggers-funnel-plot-a-marker-for-irregularities-in-scientific-publication/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.
The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-listening-to-radio-havana-cuba-via-shortwave/">&raquo;</a></p>

The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.
 Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-dr-dobbs-journal-shuffles-off-this-mortal-coil/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.
websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-09-some-notes-on-echolink-and-websdr/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Nothing personal, but it's time to take a break from Twitter.
I tried to do this back in 2008 when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-30-im-taking-a-break-from-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

I don't know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect, but it seems to be pretty good.

This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.

            <p>Some questions to ask while you're trying to sort this out.
 Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the parts that "just work", because undoubtably there are unexpected cases that won't work just when you need them to work.  Identify the message flows through the system. Where do signals get generated, where do they get retransmitted, where do they get changed and when does a human interpret them? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-21-how-does-this-system-even-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. That's a pretty typical pattern for me these days, and I'm trying to make sense of whether it's a good one.
The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours. There are lots of competitors for the morning attention, including yesterday's inbox, the overnight news, and the steady tick of Twitter and Facebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-20-wake-up-get-a-cup-of-coffee-start-typing/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>wjchat is a weekly Wednesday night chat session on Twitter. "wj" in this case is short for "web journalism". Tonight's session is on using social media for long term editorial projects.
The longest long-term editorial project I'm working on that's relevant to this is Arborwiki, which is now part of the Localwiki project. It's a local encyclopedia of the Ann Arbor area, and as such it's a very useful spot to accumulate the back story for any story that you want to tell. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-19-tonights-wjchat-is-about-social-media-for-long-term-editorial-projects/">&raquo;</a></p>

I learn best by writing about what I'm doing, in enough detail to capture some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-19-when-i-dont-write-it-down-to-share-with-the-world-i-dont-learn-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A cautionary tale.
What's the value of an idea? Consider that some ideas might have a negative value; indeed that most of them might. It may take you some substantial investment to test out your idea, to prove it, to build something minimal to show people that it was real. And then when you're ready with it there might be a net result that you finally have talked to enough people that you know that you need to scrap it and start over. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-14-that-bright-idea-of-yours-might-cost-you-25000/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Death and destruction: why were we so obsessed with it in the 70s? So many gruesome, heart wrenching unhappy endings were fodder for pop songs and we gleefully bought the 45s. Well maybe not gleefully, maybe with a maudlin curiosity. This Gordon Lightfoot tune is a great example, a story song about the SS Edmund Fitzgerald sinking in 1975, killing everyone on board. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-10-39th-anniversary-of-the-wreck-of-the-edmund-fitzgerald-on-nov-10-2014/">&raquo;</a></p>
