    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The Ann Arbor News story tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.
What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-12-vellum-a-downtown-ann-arbor-restaurant-has-closed/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.
Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.
The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-05-ann-arbor-city-council-highlights-for-5-january-2015-a-preview/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65 pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into the machine. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-03-olivetti-programma-101/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As of this writing (2 am Sunday December 28 2014 in Ann Arbor MI) there is no word on the fate of the lost airliner Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 which went missing on a flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. Trying to find reliable information about an event in progress half way around the world is always a challenge. Twitter and Facebook are good at moving information quickly around the globe, but they send sense and nonsense in equal parts, and it's easy to read things that are speculation or even outright falsehoods. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-28-what-we-dont-know-about-airasia-flight-8501/">&raquo;</a></p>

 “Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-beggers-funnel-plot-a-marker-for-irregularities-in-scientific-publication/">&raquo;</a></p>

The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-listening-to-radio-havana-cuba-via-shortwave/">&raquo;</a></p>

The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.
 Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-dr-dobbs-journal-shuffles-off-this-mortal-coil/">&raquo;</a></p>

I tried to do this back in 2008 when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-30-im-taking-a-break-from-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out that the routine I have with Google's Gmail for handling inbound correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.
I don't know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect, but it seems to be pretty good. Email comes in, I read it, and anything that deserves further attention but can't be handled right away is starred. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-25-establishing-a-routine-for-processing-inbound-communications/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues. By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status. This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.
I've been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while, using its milestones feature to track categories. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-24-github-based-kanban-boards-zenhub-waffle-huboard-blossom-et-al/">&raquo;</a></p>

This map is from the Tennessee Gas Pipeline which carries gas from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast US. The map is accompanied by a series of operational data and alerts that tell gas shippers what to expect, provide gas consumption forecasts based on the weather, and alerts users of the pipeline of exceptional events in the case of equipment failure. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-23-kinder-morgan-gas-pipeline-maps/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Twitter, especially. A search this morning for "ann arbor ice" gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around.

            <p>Some questions to ask while you're trying to sort this out.
 Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the parts that "just work", because undoubtably there are unexpected cases that won't work just when you need them to work.  Identify the message flows through the system. Where do signals get generated, where do they get retransmitted, where do they get changed and when does a human interpret them? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-21-how-does-this-system-even-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. That's a pretty typical pattern for me these days, and I'm trying to make sense of whether it's a good one.
The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours. There are lots of competitors for the morning attention, including yesterday's inbox, the overnight news, and the steady tick of Twitter and Facebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-20-wake-up-get-a-cup-of-coffee-start-typing/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>wjchat is a weekly Wednesday night chat session on Twitter. "wj" in this case is short for "web journalism". Tonight's session is on using social media for long term editorial projects.
The longest long-term editorial project I'm working on that's relevant to this is Arborwiki, which is now part of the Localwiki project. It's a local encyclopedia of the Ann Arbor area, and as such it's a very useful spot to accumulate the back story for any story that you want to tell. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-19-tonights-wjchat-is-about-social-media-for-long-term-editorial-projects/">&raquo;</a></p>

I learn best by writing about what I'm doing, in enough detail to capture some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-19-when-i-dont-write-it-down-to-share-with-the-world-i-dont-learn-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A cautionary tale.
What's the value of an idea? Consider that some ideas might have a negative value; indeed that most of them might. It may take you some substantial investment to test out your idea, to prove it, to build something minimal to show people that it was real. And then when you're ready with it there might be a net result that you finally have talked to enough people that you know that you need to scrap it and start over. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-14-that-bright-idea-of-yours-might-cost-you-25000/">&raquo;</a></p>
