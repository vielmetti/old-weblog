        <p>As part of watching DTE slowly restore power to the area, I&#39;ve been pulling down copies of their outage maps.&#0160; These are big PDF files, suitable for framing, that encode a bunch of data in them about where the power is out.&#0160; Here&#39;s some tools I used to get details out of PDF into image formats, (hopefully) to get them back down to a spreadsheet full of numbers.

        <p>It was a dark and stormy night.&nbsp; Suddenly, the power went out.
The biggest effect: 210,000 DTE customers all over SE Michigan went dark.&nbsp; Here's a piece of the map to give you an idea - click through for current map.
The best DTE site for updates seems to be mobile.dteenergy.com, as much as there is a "best".
 The biggest side effect of this was an outage of the AT&amp;T mobile network and as a result the iPhone network. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-28-dte-power-outage-on-28-december-2008-takes-down-att-iphone-wireless-service/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>While waiting for the AATA&#39;s mobile ridetrak system to go back online (it&#39;s been down for two weeks now due to a series of unfortunate events), I&#39;ve been thinking about how to model the network of bus and pedestrian routes so that you could say some useful things about the goodness of a given route network for a particular task at a particular time of day.&#0160; What I&#39;m after is understanding just how far I can reasonably go from where I am to somewhere else useful based on bus routes, my willingness or ability to walk, and the minute by minute information about how late the bus is. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-23-the-bus-game-why-its-important-to-get-the-aatas-mobile-ridetrak-back-online/">&raquo;</a></p>

serendipity in book-finding: (via if:book)
the pinpoint accuracy of computer-searches, leaves those of us lucky enough to have spent time in library stacks, nostalgic for the unexpected discovery of something we didn&#39;t know we were looking for but which just happened, serendipitously, to be on a nearby shelf.

A new book on its way on the post-automotive era; quoting their release page in its entirety.
After the Car By: John Urry (Lancaster University) and Kingsley DENNIS.    Description It is difficult to imagine a world without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next few decades. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-15-after-the-car-john-urry-and-kingsley-dennis/">&raquo;</a></p>
