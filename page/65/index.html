<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/Conservation/bubblewrap.htm">Build It Solar has the super-easy instructions</a>, which involve cutting the wrap to the size of the window, spraying a thin film of water on the window, and letting the bubble wrap stick.&nbsp; Add a little glycerin perhaps if you have trouble removing it in the spring.</p>

<p>It's apparently <a href="http://forums2.gardenweb.com/forums/load/strucs/msg042302161244.html">a common practice in the greenhouse industry.</a></p>

<p>And it's more transparent and high tech than <a href="http://www.hammerzone.com/archives/letters/windows/insulate.htm">duct taping some foam insulation to the window.</a></p>

      <p>We have a patch of land that should be doing something productive but instead is growing Japanese Knotweed.&nbsp; I'd like to fix that.</p>

<p>The simple description of how to deal with it seems to be to smother the affected area (using tarps or old carpets) and to do container gardening on top of that ground cover.&nbsp; (<a href="http://landscaping.about.com/cs/weedsdiseases/a/knotweed_2.htm">ref about.com</a>)</p>

from the Randy Pausch lecture on time management, which I looked at 100 days ago:
</p><blockquote><p>
And do a time journal, and if that's really too much effort, just count the number of hours you watch of television in the next week. That's my gift to you.</p>

<p><p>
The last thing is, once you&rsquo;ve got your day-timer, make a note for 30 days from today - it&rsquo;s okay if that one goes &quot;ding&quot; to remind you! - and revisit this talk in 30 days. It will be up on the web, courtesy of Gabe, and ask: &quot;What have I changed?&quot; If I haven&rsquo;t changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you&rsquo;ll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that&rsquo;s important. Time is all we have. And you may find one day you have less than you think. Thank you.</p></blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>From my inbox:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>
with a body about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger
than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my
house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> is only there during evening and night. We think it hides in the bush the rest of the day.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we found it I did a lot of research and I am pretty sure that it is an Araneus trifolium (<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span>, shamrock <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>).
It has the rings around the legs and is the right size. It is in the
right time of year, has the right type of web, and has the right kind
of behavior.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know whether it’s male or female. How do I figure out? Are
Araneus Trifolium poisonous? Are they common where we live? Can you
look at the pictures and figure out if I’m right and it is Araneus
trifolium? (they are attached)</p></blockquote><p>and my response:</p></p>

<p>Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pictures of your <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>.&nbsp; It looks like it is enjoying this time of year!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> spiders are very common this time of year, and they are found all over Michigan.&nbsp; Spiders can be very hard to identify from photos, because there are so many species of them, but it seems that you have made a good identification.<br />
<br />
The reference I'm looking at is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257">http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a><br />
<br />
Shorthouse, David P. submitted. Taxonomic and natural history description of FAM: ARANEIDAE, Araneus trifolium (Hentz, 1847). In: The Nearctic <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span> Database. David P. Shorthouse (editor). World Wide<br />
Web electronic publication. Direct link:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257"> http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a> (Accessed:<br />
9/28/2008 10:55:02 PM).<br />
<br />
which describes both males and females of this species.&nbsp; From that page it seems that females are more often seen later in the season, that they are larger than the males, and that their distinctive leg rings (&quot;annulations&quot;) are more distinctive than the males.&nbsp; So I'm guessing that it's a female, but you<br />
should try to measure its size to compare against that reference.&nbsp; (One way to do that in photos is to put something of known size, like a coin, next to the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> when you photograph it.)<br />
<br />
A second reference is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/11644/bgpage">http://bugguide.net/node/view/<wbr></wbr>11644/bgpage</a><br />
<br />
which is the Bug Guide, which is hosted by Iowa State University Entomology. They have lots of pictures, as well as an identification service.&nbsp; Their photos match up with your photos so you're again probably confirming that identification.<br />
<br />
As to the question of danger from <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites, the Michigan DNR has a page on insects and spiders:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204---,00.html">http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,<wbr></wbr>1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204--<wbr></wbr>-,00.html</a><br />
<br />
which talks about the two known spiders of medical importance in Michigan, the Northern Black Widow and the Brown Recluse.&nbsp; Since it's not one of those, you shouldn't worry about it being dangerous.&nbsp; In fact I searched google for the phrase<br />
<br />
&quot;<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites&quot;<br />
<br />
and got no hits.&nbsp; You might find this search interesting too:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=pumpkin+spider&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">http://www.google.com/trends?<wbr></wbr>q=<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span>+<span class="nfakPe">spider</span>&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=<wbr></wbr>all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0</a><br />
<br />
which shows that people look for <span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> spiders this time of year!</p>

<p>thanks</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/">Dinah</a> made up a holiday called 
<a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a>.
<a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/metagrrrl/2002/12/a_new_holiday_d.html">She wrote</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>
I&rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place
in the time between the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes and their following
new moons. Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas
and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&rsquo;t
buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that
you have enough.</p></blockquote><p>This weekend&rsquo;s project is emptying out bits of the garage that have accumulated reusable leftovers from the summer&rsquo;s kitchen project.&nbsp; We took a couple of windows to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Reuse_Center">Reuse Center on S. Industrial</a> which gladly took them, and there&rsquo;s more in the garage that looks like it should go before the first frost.</p></p>

<p>In thinking about how to identify the things that need to go, I'm back to notes I wrote about seiri.&nbsp; The approach here is to use red tags to identify things that don't belong, and then to systematically remove the things that don't belong so that no red tags are left and no new red tags appear.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/48871860/">The most interesting thing I've written about seiri </a>was written on paper, so you can see the scan.&nbsp; I want to go back and do the red tag thing online in some clever way.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-25-storage-density/">Storage density in petabytes per shipping container</a>
      </h3>
      <p>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&nbsp; I'm looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you'd get in &quot;petabytes per container&quot;.</p>

<p>The answer appears to be &quot;about one petabyte per six linear feet of container&quot;, or put another way, &quot;about one petabyte per ten cubic meters of containerized storage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/web/petabox.php">The Internet Archive's Petabox design specs:</a> included requirements to run in a shipping container.</p>

<p>How big is a shipping container? <a href="http://blog.managednetworks.co.uk/it-support/googles-20-petabytes/"> If a grain of rice is one byte, a shipping container can hold a half a gigabyte,</a> and a petabyte covers central London in a meter of rice.&nbsp; So, a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,278,273.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,278,273&amp;RS=PN/7,278,273">Google's patent <strong>7,278,273 </strong>covers a modular data center:</a></p><blockquote><p>Modular data centers with modular components suitable for use with rack or
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; shelf mount computing systems, for example, are disclosed. The modular
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; center generally includes a modular computing module including an
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; intermodal shipping container and computing systems mounted within the
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; container and configured to be shipped and operated within the container
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and a temperature control system for maintaining the air temperature
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; surrounding the computing systems. The intermodal shipping container may
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; be configured in accordance to International Organization for
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Standardization (ISO) container manufacturing standards or otherwise
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; configured with respect to height, length, width, weight, and/or lifting
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; points of the container for transport via an intermodal transport
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; infrastructure. The modular design enables the modules to be cost
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; effectively built at a factory and easily transported to and deployed at
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a data center site.
</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/perspectives.jsp">Sun built something called Project Black Box, now called the Sun Modular Datacenter; </a>they are selling it to organizations that have maxed out their existing data centers or who need on site computing before the rest of a facility under construction is built.&nbsp; It specs out at 3 petabytes per 20 foot container.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rackable.com/products/icecube.aspx">Rackable Systems has the ICECube, at 7.1 petabytes per 40 foot container:</a></p><blockquote><p>Rackable Systems’ award-winning ICE Cube™ data center solution delivers 
extreme server and storage density in a self-contained, fully portable 20’ 
or 40’ container. Its advanced cooling design dramatically cuts ongoing 
operational expenses as does its easy serviceability. First deployed in March, 
2007, the latest generation ICE Cube more than doubles the maximum density to 
2800 independent servers per container—for up to 22,400 cores in a 40' x 
8' container. For storage-focused deployments, the ICE Cube is capable of housing 
up to 7.1 Petabytes of data. Designed to augment or replace traditional brick-and-mortar 
data centers of any size, these high densities are achieved while offering a broader 
choice of container sizes and configurability of Rackable Systems’ Eco-Logical™ 
servers and storage.</p></blockquote><p>The best researchy piece I found on this is from <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/01/11/microsoft-confirms-data-center-in-a-box/">Chuck Thacker of Microsoft Research, via a piece in Data Center Knowledge in January 2008 </a></p><blockquote><p>In October Thacker gave a presentation at the Stanford Networking Seminar titled “Rethinking Data Centers” (available in <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/seminars/10_25_07.ppt">PowerPoint</a>)
that examined various approaches to “data center in a box” approach to
portable data centers. Thacker’s slides describe an approach using
40-foot containerized data centers packed with 32 energy-efficient
racks, each filled with 40 1U servers. Using 64 of those containers
would result in a data center facility filled with 82,000 servers and
using 16 megawatts of power.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/">Stanford Networking Seminar </a>schedule shows a bunch of interesting talks, some with slides, almost all with speaker bios, recommended.&nbsp; Here's the description of this talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Microsoft builds several data centers each year, with each center containing in excess of fifty thousand servers.&nbsp; This is 
quite expensive, and we'd like to reduce the capital and operating expenses for these centers.</p>

<p>
This talk suggests that an effective way to do this is to treat the data center as a system, rather than focusing on the 
individual components such as networking and servers.&nbsp; I'll describe one way this could work, with a particular focus on the 
networking infrastructure. </p></blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>Party like it's what year?</p><blockquote><p>The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: </p>

<p>First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. </p>

<p>Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency. </p>

<p>Third, such financial helplessness, in the country at large, that gold has to be bought or borrowed instantly in huge quantity from other countries, and that emergency expedients have to be adopted to provide the necessary medium of exchange for ordinary business. </p>

<p>Fourth, the shutting down of manufacturing enterprises, suddenly and on a large scale, chiefly because of absolute inability to get credit, but partly also because of fear that demand from consumers will suddenly disappear. </p>

<p>Fifth, fulfilment of this last misgiving, in the shape of abrupt disappearance of the buying demand throughout the country, this particular phenomenon being prolonged through a period of months and sometimes years.</p></blockquote><p>Answer below.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (<span class="normal"><a href="http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg368.html"><em>Latrodectus mactans</em> Fabricius</a>) </span>on September 7, 2008.&nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System's Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.</p>

<p>The best news article on this is from the <a href="http://www.thedailynews.cc/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=2&amp;ArticleID=22139">Greenville, MI Daily News</a>, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.&nbsp; A quote from this article:</p><blockquote><p>Doug Reeves,
assistant chief of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources'
Wildlife Division, said he's seen about seven northern black widows,
&quot;usually when I'm digging around woodpiles.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They're not particularly rare but they're not something that's found, unless you look in the right habitat,&quot; Reeves said.<br /><br />Doctors told Gregory that his was one of only one or two southern black widow bites ever recorded in Michigan.<br /><br />&quot;They told him he would have a much better chance of winning the lottery,&quot; Margaret Gregory said.<br /><br />Reeves
said he'd never before heard of a southern black widow bite in the
state. However, Reeves said he's heard of other cases where non-native
spiders and snakes have come into the state through international
shipments, as was the case with Brad Gregory and his southern black
widow.</p></blockquote><p>The southern black widow spider is not a common Michigan spider.</p>

<p>Some more reading:</p>

<p><a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Latrodectus_mactans.html">Latrodectus mactans on the Animal Diversity Web</a>, a good survey, on its habitat:</p><blockquote><p>A terrestrial environment is the habitat of the <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>.
It is ubiquitous and builds strong-walled retreats quite close to the
ground and in dark sheltered spots. However, it also spreads its snares
over plants. Webs of the black widow spider can be found in recesses
under stones or logs in a woodpile, in crevices or holes in dirt
embankments, in barns and outbuildings. They can also be found around
lids of dust bins, around seats of outdoor privies, spaces under chips
of wood, around stacked materials of any kind, in deserted animal
burrows or rodent holes, and entwined in grape arbors. This spider may
find its way into clothing or shoes and occasionally seeks a spot in a
house to build a web, but it is usually not found indoors. When it does
seek shelter in a building, it is due to cold weather and a need for a
dry shelter. In addition, in the eastern United States, <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>
is associated with littered areas, with dumps of large cities, with
garages, and storage sheds. In arid parts of Arizona, this spider
inhabits almost every crevice in the soil and its nests are found in
cholla cacti and agave plants. (Ferrand, 1988; Kaston, 1953;

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-12-bunny-biscuit-b/">bunny biscuit brief</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn't find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;bunny cutter&quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference.&nbsp; You should be able to find these things everywhere once Easter rolls around; just in case you can't for some reason, <a href="http://www.shopbakersnook.com/221.html">here's a good sized selection for sale.</a></p>

<p>I'll note, just for my own embarrassment, two things about this recipe.&nbsp; First, though it calls for some baking soda, you would be foolish to do (as I did exactly one time) to use exclusively baking soda instead of baking powder as measured; bleah is all I need to say.&nbsp; Second, though it calls for 5 Tbsp of oil, I can say from somewhat sheepish experience that it will also work with no oil, and still tasted pretty good.</p>

<p>Bunny biscuits are usually on the menu when we make soup; this week's soup was a &quot;white beans and whatever else was around&quot; assembly, which turned out pretty good.&nbsp; It's hard not to have a good soup when you have so many good tomatoes.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Do first before your hands get sticky: Take out ingredients, measuring
cups, cookie sheet fork, measuring spoons, bunny cutter, sheet of wax
paper.&nbsp; Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</p>

<p>
In big metal mixing bowl measure:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup whole wheat flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup white flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 tsp baking powder<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp baking soda<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp salt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Tbsp sugar</p>

<p>
Mix all this up with a fork.</p>

<p>
Add:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 Tbsp canola oil</p>

<p>
Mix again with a fork.</p>

<p>
In the 1c glass measuring cup, mix (approx):<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup yogurt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup milk</p>

<p>
Stir until it's uniform.</p>

<p>
Add to metal mixing bowl.&nbsp; Mix with fork until it's a more or less
uniform consistency. Put wax paper on a big surface and coat with
flour.&nbsp; Turn out dough, knead ten times.&nbsp; Pat out until .75&quot; thick.
 Cut out biscuits, handling as little as possible.&nbsp; Place on ungreased
cookie sheet, bake 12 minutes, remove immediately.</p>

<p>
Mwah!</p>

      <p>Merlin Mann has relaunched <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>; he doesn't want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&nbsp; It's a good choice.</p>

<p>He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish.&nbsp; (Or something like that; it probably overstates the issue.)&nbsp; And he bemoans the tendency of people to consume an endless stream of shitty first drafts as if that was the only thing worth doing:</p><blockquote><p>What worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of
fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of <em>everything</em>.
I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of
it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.&nbsp; (from <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better">better)</a></p></blockquote><p>Since this post itself is a shitty first draft of a summary of what is probably 100 other things I've thought about, I'll keep it short.&nbsp; Sometimes, when you want to have deep insight into a topic, you have to immerse yourself in the details.&nbsp; Your makebelieve insight and fake-connectedness are exercises in helping you understand the world, and even though sometimes the explanation that comes up doesn't really sound any more insightful than what your wikipedia-quoting eight year old can come up with, it came from you.&nbsp; Sometimes, if you are really lucky, you get to reflect on a bunch of first drafts and turn them into second and third drafts - hurray!&nbsp; But at least you got that thinking out into public in a format that can get some feedback.&nbsp; The best way to have one good idea is to have a thousand ideas.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">Clinical reminder systems</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of a series on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems">reminder systems.</a></p>

<p>--</p>

<p>One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head.</p>

<p>As an example of this (not the only example), there is a system developed at the University of Michigan called ClinfoTracker.&nbsp; &nbsp;It uses information from patient healthcare records to remind patients and medical staff of expected upcoming dates for appointments and tests, and to remind doctors that if a test has not been completed that they should re-request it.&nbsp; This complex data and protocol driven reminder scheduling is way beyond the postcard you get from your dentist, and as such it can provide some considerable addition support in working with people who may not remember all of the things that need to happen in the future.&nbsp; Quoting now <a href="http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=609">from a press release from the UMHS</a>:</p><blockquote><div>“We felt there was a need to develop a reminder and tracking
system that could be generalized in very distinct, diverse practices.
We found the ClinfoTracker system could fit relatively easily into
routine patient care flow and was easy to implement into a practice,”
says study author Donald Nease, M.D., associate professor of <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/fammed/">family medicine </a>at the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/medschool/">U-M Medical School </a>and co-creator of ClinfoTracker.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The greatest improvements in screening rates occurred at practices
that were more technologically savvy and practices where employees were
more adaptable and worked well together.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Initially, ClinfoTracker was developed to help doctors track
patients’ clinical problems and preventive care over time. The software
can also assist with chronic care, such as diabetes testing, as well as
with cancer screenings and other routine tests.</div></blockquote>



<p><a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/clinfotracker/home">The ClinfoTracker site describes the operation at the clinical level:</a></p><blockquote><p>Specifically, Cielo Clinic provides the clinician with a one sheet
clinical summary (Encounter Form) that includes chronic and active
problems, and needed services. Services that a patient might be
eligible for are based on their age, gender and/or clinical problems.
Following the principle that clinicians should only be prompted when
necessary, prior to the visit, Clinic scans billing, lab and radiology
databases to determine if an eligible service is up to date. If it is,
clinicians are not prompted to perform it.
</p>

<p>During the patient visit, the clinician markes updates to the
problem list on the Encounter Form, and checks the appropriate boxes
next to the prompted services. Services may be marked as having been
&quot;Done&quot;, &quot;Discussed&quot;, &quot;Ordered&quot;, &quot;Patient refused&quot;, &quot;Not a candidate&quot;,
or &quot;Not addressed.&quot; In this way, clinicians have flexibility in
indicating how the prompt has been addressed, or whether the prompt is
appropriate. For example, &quot;Not a candidate&quot; might be checked for a
patient that is flagged as needing a pap smear, but has had a
hysterectomy. This removes the prompt. A &quot;Patient refused&quot; check
removes the prompt for one year.</p></blockquote><p>The U of Michigan system is one of several such systems that use the phrase &quot;clinical reminder system&quot;.&nbsp; Some others include:</p>

<p><a href="http://crs.heinz.cmu.edu/">The Clinical Reminder System</a> is a project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and the West Penn Allegheny Health System:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">The Clinical 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reminder System is a prototype Decision Support System that combines a 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;relational database, a knowledge base consisting of algorithms that 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;implement disease management guidelines, integration with hospital 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;information systems and a web-based interface allowing for physician 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;management of patient data and suggested medical responses. It is a joint 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;research project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and The 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Department of Medicine at The West Penn Allegheny Health System. This 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;application has been in use within a clinical setting since 2001.</span></p></blockquote><p>There is a similar system in place at the VA hospitals; here's<a href="http://www.jamia.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/438"> a review showing barriers to adoption: (Saleem and Asch, 2005)</a></p><blockquote><p>Optimally using the CR system for its intended purpose<sup>&nbsp;</sup>was impeded by (1) lack of coordination between nurses and providers;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(2) using the reminders while not with the patient, impairing<sup>&nbsp;</sup>data acquisition and/or implementation of recommended actions;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(3) workload; (4) lack of CR flexibility; and (5) poor interface<sup>&nbsp;</sup>usability. Facilitators included (1) limiting the number of<sup>&nbsp;</sup>reminders at a site; (2) strategic location of the computer<sup>&nbsp;</sup>workstations; (3) integration of reminders into workflow; and<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(4) the ability to document system problems and receive prompt<sup>&nbsp;</sup>administrator feedback.</p></blockquote><p>This set of tools uses &quot;reminder system&quot; as a part of a &quot;decision support system&quot; (both of which are lovely sets of words with a bunch of coded history and software tied around them).</p>

<p>One good contact in the Ann Arbor area is <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=kzheng">Kai Zheng</a> who teaches a course, <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/caid/display_course.cfm?CourseID=HMP668">Introduction to Health Informatics</a>, which covers this and other topics.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">Blogger&#39;s secret: don&#39;t feed the trolls</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.</p>

<p>This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page.</p>

<p>On the spam fighting front, your choice of platform matters a lot.&nbsp; I've been happy with Typepad's service, though it lets a few things go by the admin tools make it possible to unpublish something fairly quickly.&nbsp; People using Wordpress use its default Akismet tool with good success.&nbsp; If your comment tool doesn't aggressively screen for spam, you need a better system.&nbsp; In many cases, Trackback is a source of spam as well; I ended up completely blocking that just to save the hassle.</p>

<p>There's a huge and messy market in fake comments, helped by systems like Amazon's Mechanical Turk that anonymize the payments for them.&nbsp; Every so often the fake commenter actually has something marginally interesting to say, so I tend to let those through but rewrite the target URL of their post to remove the commercial value from it.&nbsp; Life is too short to live with commenter bots.</p>

<p>When on the odd chance that you have an angry, abusive critic aimed at you - the sort of person who would scribble profanities or spew personal attacks - the only reasonable remedy is to remove the text.&nbsp; Ideally, you do that without acknowledging it, or if it's important for context to keep some fragment of it around, a traditional method is to edit the text to make it semi-legible e.g. by removing the vwls or st*rr*ng th* ess*nt**l p*rts **t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let the critics and nastygrams find their own site, and force their authors out into the open.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One of the reasons that blogs emerged from the Internet primordial soup in the late 1990s was that Usenet had degenerated into spam, fake posts, and abuse; by holding the discussion on a web page you control, you could start to control it.&nbsp; &nbsp;That makes the world a little bit harder to follow when discussions fly around, but in exchange you get to be not just author but (critically) also editor of your own publication.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-08-reminder-system/">Reminder systems, a survey and overview</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of what I hope will be a series of posts, and with that I hope some publishable output at the end; my guess is that if I write about this a dozen times I'll have 1800 publishable words on the topic when I'm done.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quick word check on the search engine shows up 400000+ uses of the term, and a handful of ads, which suggests that's a common phrase; you'll also see &quot;reminder services&quot;, &quot;appointments reminder&quot;, &quot;meetings reminder&quot;, and a zillion others.&nbsp; So this is not new ground, not by any means.</p>

<p>The particular chunk of this space I am interested in is the &quot;note to future self&quot;; the message that you send to yourself in the future to do or think of something, which comes to you as a message in some way.&nbsp; Think of it as a time capsule that you open, or a package that you had forgotten and then reopened; some part of it will hopefully be novel and trigger some &quot;that's easy&quot; reaction rather than the &quot;oh blah I still can't figure out how to do that&quot;.</p>

<p>My future self is a lot more capable than I am, as witnessed by all of the promises that my current self makes for my future self to do.&nbsp; Sometimes these are things which sound easy in the instant but actually prove hard in the future; others are things which my current self has figured out in essence but just hasn't worked through in detail, and thus it needs a little nudge to push it back to that memory of how to solve it.&nbsp; It always helps to have some sleep on problems.</p>

<p>So we remind ourselves.&nbsp; We put notes on the door, post things on the fridge, leave out the shoes on the steps so that they go to the shoemakers, paste sticky notes on our laptops.&nbsp; Elaborate tickler systems send us to the stores to buy forty three color coded folders, which get cut up and used by our children for craft projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;Facebook tells us about our friends birthdays, but not quite in enough time to send them postcards; our dentist and insurance agent seem to be the most regular, if boring correspondents.</p>

<p>I'll collect the various systems I've used, am using, or gave up on in this category; there are some in the previous &quot;Calendars&quot; section which I'll mine for ideas.&nbsp; </p>

year I met someone who grows a large variety of Paw Paws and took my
impression of them from this small wild-ish crop with limited yields to
&quot;how many do you want and what variety&quot;. Paw Paws are a great American
fruit that hardly anyone knows about. The first time I had one it
tasted just like sugar cookie dough; slightly dough/flour like with
plenty of sugar and a little vanilla. We should be able to get the
quantity and quality we are looking and produce some volume Paw Paw
gelato, and of course Paw Paw Cream Pie.

As one might expect from the dark maroon color and decay-like scent of the flowers, <br />Asimina triloba receive pollination services from flies more than bees, inspiring some grow- <br />ers to hang road-killed animals in their pawpaw groves to effect more efficient fertilization. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nativetreesociety.org/species/sp_threads/paw_paw.htm">more details on this phenomenon from the Native Tree Society:</a></p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most interesting things researchers discovered was that
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; paw paw flowers are primarily pollinated by carrion flies and
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; commercial growers now hang plastic &quot;donut shop&quot; buckets
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; with &quot;road kill&quot; to stimulate visits to their
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; patches by the carrion flies.&nbsp; (They hang used buckets
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; because it keeps it away from other critters.)

<div>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason I can surmise the carrion fly link to paw paw pollination
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; is that in more wild areas of the western Appalachians paw
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; paw is a common lowland speicies, especially along
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; streams......and...

<p><div>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Paw paw is one of the first trees to flower in the spring.&nbsp; There
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are few insects generally around at that time of year because
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a frost can take place at almost any time and pollinator numbers
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are severely limited.&nbsp; Carrion flies feeding on dead animals
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; that often comprise a portion of streamside detritus
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; accumulated during winter and spring freshets would certainly
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; make some sort of sense, especially during the midst of the first
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; few warm days of spring.

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is much too easy this time of year when tomatoes are in abundance and taste great; don't even think of doing it with winter styrofoam tomatoes.</p>

<p>Sauce:</p>

<p>A little olive oil<br />Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller<br />Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a pan.&nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don't bother to skin or peel or seed them.&nbsp; Sprinkle on basil.</p>

<p>Cook, uncovered, over low heat until the tomatoes are cooked down into a sauce (but not so much that it's a paste).</p>

<p>Serve with anelletti - Trader Joe's has it right now - or some other similar small pasta like baby shells.</p>

<p>I fried a few sliced mushrooms and chopped onions in a little olive oil and added them to mine, but the boys preferred just tomato sauce, perhaps with a little grated cheese.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of an occasional &quot;blogger's secret&quot; series.</p>

<p>Write for yourself. Really, you are best off with an audience of one
to start, and use your time and effort to write down things that you
will want to read in a week or a month or a year. If you are
interesting to your audience of one, you have some hope of being
interesting to some other person somewhere else on the planet who is
interested in you. Tip: If you have already writtten something
somewhere on the net that you're proud of, repurpose it or reprint it
in your blog; that can get you off to a good start.</p>

<p>As an adjunct to this, you can use scheduled reminder services to nudge you in the right direction and remind you about things you might want to remember in the future.&nbsp; So write that note to your future self, and then publish a pointer to in in the future, so that you'll see it again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging.</p>

<p>If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.</p>

<p>Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG.</p>

<p>If you're doing your homework, you should be able to do homework for your readers. Find a popular search term that's driving traffic to an existing page, identify an alternate database with better resources than what a simple Google search will unearth, and add to your existing copy. I find Google Books to be a good source, especially for pre-1922 materials which give some historical perspective on the matter. Amazon and your favorite library are good book reference sources. Thousands of other databases have awful user interfaces and hidden away content which can be selectively referenced for good effect.</p>

<p>This is neatly summarized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller_(social_epistemologist)">Steve Fuller</a> in his 2001 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Management-Foundations-KMCI-Press/dp/0750673656">Knowledge management foundations</a> </p>

<p><blockquote><p>Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.</p></blockquote><p>and thus as a blogger you have an opportunity to pull from one unfamiliar expert system into a familiar non-expert system.</p></p>
