<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/polenta">delicious tag polenta</a>, from the blog <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/">Hungry Cravings</a> - the so called <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/2008/10/cheater-method.html">Cheater Method Polenta</a>.</p><p>The critics were skeptical:</p><div class="msg">

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-fire.html">The City of Ann Arbor has started an email-based delivery service for changes and updates to the city&#39;s web site run by GovDelivery.</a>&#0160; I contacted Dave Sommerness, a University of Michigan graduate and their COO, to find out more.</p><p><strong>
How did your organization get started, and who was your first customer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govdelivery.com">GovDelivery</a>, Inc. was started in 1999 by our two co-founders, CEO Scott Burns and EVP of Sales Zach Stabenow. &#0160;We developed the GovDelivery Digital Subscription Management system in 2000 in collaboration with the City of St. Paul, who had a need for reliable communication with its residents. &#0160;We found this need to be pervasive across public sector organizations, and it&#39;s taken off quite well from there.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Government web sites are built with all kinds of technologies. &#0160;How do you manage the process so that it all looks the same to the user?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We integrate with client sites by simple links on their web pages. &#0160;The effect is seamless because we customize our web and email templates to match the look-and-feel of each client. &#0160;Behind the scenes GovDelivery is deployed as a multi-tenant, SaaS system, so Ann Arbor is using the same basic application as our other clients.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
The service I signed up for was an email based one. &#0160;What are your plans for looking at web 2.0 technologies for notification, e.g. using something like Twitter to do messaging?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We&#39;re always looking forward to new technologies and applications to our system/market. &#0160;A couple years ago we added RSS capability, so our clients can publish their messages as RSS feeds in addition to sending them out through email. &#0160;We&#39;ve seen a lot of excitement in our market over Web 2.0 technologies, so we&#39;re developing functionality to take advantage of that and promote more options for communication and collaboration between government and citizens. &#0160;A few examples of Web<br />
2.0 notification that we already support include automatically posting messages to blogs, updating a Facebook page, and using public RSS feeds to publish bulletins to widgets.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Do you work with libraries as part of your business, and if so, can you share some good stories from those implementations?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>The majority of our experience has been with government bodies - from small cities and counties up to the largest federal departments - and transit authorities, though we have some experience with education,<br />
non-profits, and other organizations. &#0160;We work with a number of libraries, mainly through city accounts, but the most notable stand-alone library account is the Library of Congress.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
What makes St. Paul a good place to run this business from, and not Silicon Valley or Washington, DC?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>Good business is about good people, and there&#39;s a great pool of talent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. We&#39;re one of the fastest growing software companies in the area, which attracts talented people and helps us to retain and keep them challenged. &#0160;We don&#39;t have the issues that Silicon Valley has where folks are more apt to jump to the next flavor of the day. &#0160;Because of the density of clients in D.C., we do maintain a sales office and staff there, which we plan to grow as the business does.</p><p><strong>
Who do you root for when Michigan plays Minnesota?</strong></p><p>I grew up a Bulldog hockey fan in Duluth - the Gophers were big rivals, so it&#39;s been tough for me to become a fan of any of their teams. &#0160;The real dilemma for me would be if Michigan ever played UMD in hockey.</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks Dave!</p>

   <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
   <p>A
conference of invited presentations is to be held in Ann Arbor on
November 7-9 2008 to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Language
Learning and to explore a paradigm shift currently taking place across
the language sciences, the growing realization of Language as a Complex
Adaptive System.</p>
   <p> Language Learning was first
published from the University of Michigan in 1948. Its subtitle then
was &quot;A Quarterly Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;; indeed the beginnings
of &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; have been attributed to this usage. In the 60
years since, the subtitle has evolved to become &quot;A Journal of Research
in Language Studies&quot; reflecting our mission: </p><blockquote><p>Language Learning is a scientific journal
dedicated to the understanding of language learning broadly defined. It
publishes research articles that systematically apply methods of
inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive
science, educational inquiry, neuroscience, ethnography,
sociolinguistics, sociology, and semiotics. It is concerned with
fundamental theoretical issues in language learning such as child,
second, and foreign language acquisition, language education,
bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain,
culture, cognition, pragmatics, and intergroup relations.</p></blockquote>
   
   <p>The
conference in 2008 will mark our 60th anniversary and our remarkable
success towards these ends. Members of the board, past editors, our
colleagues at Wiley-Blackwell, and friends and confederates in this
enterprise are gathering to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The topic of
the conference is Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent
research across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, and changes over time. However, there is mounting
evidence that processes of language acquisition, use, and change are
not independent from one another but are facets of the same complex
adaptive system. This theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues
from different branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems
(including Clay Beckner, Richard Blythe, Joan Bybee, Morten H.
Christiansen, William Croft, Nick C. Ellis, John Holland, Jinyun Ke,
Diane Larsen-Freeman, and Tom Schoenemann) at a meeting at the Santa Fe
Institute in 2007. &quot;The Five Graces Group&quot; (named after their rather
special accommodations there) are offering a position paper on Language
as a Complex Adaptive System as the introductory piece for the
conference followed by ten individual papers that discuss substantive
areas of language from this perspective. The authors of these ten
papers are active in their recognition of complexity in their
respective areas, ranging from language usage, structure and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing. Discussion of these
papers will be led by members of the board of Language Learning in
order to contextualize these influences within Applied Linguistics and
the Language Sciences more generally.</p>
   <p>Written papers
based on these presentations will form a special issue of the journal
Language Learning (2009, Volume 59, Supplement 1). The proceedings will
also be recorded and later made available through Wiley-Blackwell and

      <p>(from the ICOS mailing list)</p><p>Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common<br />
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.</p><p><a href="http://icos.cms.si.umich.edu/sites/icos.cms.si.umich.edu/files/Espeland.pdf">The Discipline of Rankings: 
Public Measures, Decoupling, and Organizational Change (PDF)</a></p><p>Michael Sauder 
University of Iowa 
 
<br /><a href="http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/espeland/home.html">Wendy Espeland 
Northwestern University </a></p><p>This article demonstrates the value of Foucault‟s conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault‟s 
depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings 
change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This 
approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the 
prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the 
external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to 
buffer or hide some activities. Members‟ tendency to internalize these pressures, to 
become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that 
rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and 
by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of 
performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional 
environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a 
crucial task for scholars.

      <p><a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com/2008/10/7-random-food-facts.html">Inspired by Kate from Four Obsessions, here are seven food-related things to share.</a></p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&#0160; If you&#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&#39;ll understand.&#0160; Locally this means that the first day of <a href="http://google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+blueberries">blueberry</a>, raspberry, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/juneberry/">juneberry</a>, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</p><p>2.&#0160; When I was a kid we made cookies out of acorns once.&#0160; It took a long time to gather them, and a lot of work to process them, and when they finally got into the oven somehow (mysteriously) they got scorched.&#0160; I&#39;ve never had the need to repeat that experience.</p><p>3.&#0160; The first complicated recipe I tried was <a href="http://amasci.com/amateur/sciamdx.html">sauce Bearnaise, using a recipe from Scientific American&#39;s The Amateur Scientist (1979 Dec, pg 178; 1981 Jan, pg 164).&#0160;</a>&#0160; It turned out pretty well.</p><p>4.&#0160; After having had <a href="http://williamtozier.com/slurry/2008/09/16/winter-squash-caramel">sweet dumpling squash</a>, I can&#39;t go back to ever eating acorn squash again.</p><p>5.&#0160; We are vegetarians at home, but I&#39;m a confirmed omnivore, and so you&#39;ll see restaurant reviews of meat dishes but only vegetarian recipes.</p><p>6.&#0160; I&#39;m bad at doing recipes because I hardly ever measure anything anymore - mostly I spice things by eye and smell, and as often as not the recipes I end up with are a description of what I did this one time with the food on hand and not instructions for what to go buy.&#0160;&#0160; I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some recipe vocabulary in some language that I&#39;m missing which could make them better, other than &quot;cook until it smells good&quot;.</p><p>7.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken to blogging recipes in part because it&#39;s a convenient way to look them up the next time I need to cook them, since I don&#39;t always know which cookbook on our shelf has the recipe on the menu plan for the week. </p><p>Tag: <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/10/jimmy-wales-gro.html">Jim Benson (e.g. &quot;stir-fried wikipedia with pimentoes&quot;)</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com/2008/02/paczki-day-tomo.html">KitchenChick (my reliable source for Paczki Day information)</a>, and The Cottage Smallholder (who <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=855">got tagged already</a>)</p>

infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with
foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of
cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not
related—they are caused by different viruses. Humans do not get the
animal disease, and animals do not get the human disease.<br /></div><br /><h3 style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Treatment and Medical Management </strong></h3>

<p>There is no specific treatment for the infection other than relief of symptoms.</p>

Over-the-counter medicines, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) can be used

children under age 12 years.</p>
<p>Salt water mouth rinses (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon of salt to 1 glass of warm
water) may be soothing if the child is able to rinse without
swallowing. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids. Extra fluid is
needed when a fever is present. The best fluids are cold milk products.
Many children refuse juices and sodas because their acid content causes
burning pain in the ulcers.</p>

This approach is particularly useful to understand the day-to-day social and material practices of calculation. Ethnography places the researcher in the same uncertain position as his or her subjects, thereby avoiding the danger of underestimating uncertainty (Agar 1986; Spradley 1979). Its emphasis on practice taps into the actual solutions developed by the users, as opposed to those intended by the designer of the system (Orlikowski 1992; Barley 1986). Our study spans three years of observations at the equity derivatives trading room of pseudonymous International Securities, a large global investment bank with American headquarters on Wall Street. From this period, we selected a single morning of trading at the merger arbitrage desk. The combination of two years of observation with one full morning of data provides a high-frequency, highly contextualized account, in line with the literature in cognitive <br />science and distributed cognition (Hutchins 1995; Hutchins and Klausen 1992).&#0160;&#0160; </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-automark-proble/">Automark problems - how to test, anticipate, and fix</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every year when I vote I use the Automark machines, which are designed for voters needing assistive voting technology at the polls.&nbsp; At my polling place I seem to be the only person who ever uses them, so this is some way to do my bit of public service.</p>

<p>The last few times I have gone through this there have been problems.&nbsp; The first time, I gave up and voted on a regular machine; the second time, I figured things out in time to vote with it.&nbsp; This time I'm going to get it right (I hope).</p>

<p>A recap of problems from previous times:</p>

<p>from May 2008, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">Automark voting issues:</a></p><blockquote><p>I got to the polling place a little bit earlier this time and tried
it again. It misbehaved the same way, but this time there was time to
figure it out, so the poll workers called in their expert who drove
over to help figure it out. The solution ended up to be very simple:
the detachable stub on the ballot must be detached before putting the
ballot into the machine, despite the very clear instructions on that
stub not to detach it, and with no visible instructions to detach it
anywhere on the AutoMARK machine.</p>

<p>I was able to find with some digging an <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ElectionDayGuide_174575_7.pdf">AutoMARK Troubleshooting Guide</a>,
which mentions two possible solutions: either remove the stub before
putting the ballot into the machine, or program the machine to
recognize the stub. I don't know whether this stub length programming
is possible with the ballots we are using.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the ballot has a stub, 
the stub length may not 
have been entered into the 
election setup information.</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the system did work with the sample ballot tested by the
poll workers - but the sample ballot did not have a stub at the top! </p></blockquote><p>Listing municipalties that are new to using AutoMARK is a huge catalog - this is just this season's clipping report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/10/21/optical_scan_voting_machines_t.aspx">Centre County, Pennsylvania (Penn State)</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Joyce McKinley, director of elections for Centre County, said voters
shouldn't have any problems with the optical scan machines unless they
overvote or undervote. </p>

<p>Overvoting happens if the voter has chosen more candidates than
allowed, and undervoting is when voters choose fewer candidates than
allowed. In those instances, voters can choose to have the ballot
returned to them or accept the ballot as it is, McKinley said.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/30600929.html">South Bend (St. Joseph County), Indiana (Notre Dame)</a> (WSBT)</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We don't know for sure that those votes are counted,&quot; said Indiana
University-South Bend Political Science Professor Dr. Elizabeth
Bennion. &quot;And, in the case of a close race, it would be very difficult
to do any kind of a recount. So, I think there is real reason for
concern.&quot;</p>

<p>That &quot;touch screen&quot; technology is used to
&quot;automark&quot; specialized ballots filled out by those with special needs
in St. Joseph County. But the actual ballots aren't tallied or counted
until the paper ballot marked by the machine is fed into the same
optical scanner used by all other voters, said St. Joseph County Clerk
Rita Glenn.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyitemoflynn.com/articles/2008/10/06/news/news07.txt">Saugus, MA</a> (The Daily Item, Lynn MA)</p><blockquote><p><span class="content">SAUGUS-This November, the town will once again
set out AutoMARK Voter Assist Terminals at each polling place and, this
time, Town Clerk Joanne Rappa hopes someone other than the poll workers
will use them.<br /><br />AutoMARK terminals allow voters with just about
any kind of handicap to cast their vote unaided in the polling
locations just like every other voter. The problem, Rappa said, is
while the town has had the machines since 2007 no one uses them. She
said she suspects they go unused for one of two reasons, people aren’t
aware the machines are available or don’t know how to use them.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.kxmc.com/News/279909.asp"><span class="content">South Dakota (KXMC via AP)</span></a></p><blockquote><p>YANKTON, S.D. (AP)&nbsp; Secretary of State Chris Nelson says a
problem that cropped up with touch-screen voting machines in the
2006 election won't recur this year.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;States must have at least one touch-screen machine in each
polling place so people with visual or other disabilities can cast
their own ballot in secret.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<a class="kxInlineLink" href="http://www.kxmc.com/t/south-dakota" title="Click here to view all related stories">South Dakota</a>'s AutoMARK machines merely mark a paper ballot that
people review after they vote to ensure its accuracy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Nelson says there was a problem with the 17-inch-long ballots
that were used in 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This year, the ballots are 14 inches long, and Nelson says the
problem won't happen again.</p></blockquote><p>As always, vote early, and vote often.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-22-what-exactly-am/">outside.in &#34;top local blog&#34; roundup: what exactly am i writing about here?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>outside.in is a blog aggregator; it scoops up posts from around the net, codes them by geography, and then presents you the reader with a feed that's local to whatever you want it to be local about.&nbsp; <a href="http://outside.in/Ann_Arbor_MI">Here is the outside.in Ann Arbor page</a> .&nbsp; I get their newsletter sent to me which ends up being a good day's local news clippings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outside.in/2008/10/21/dept-of-blogiology-101-ann-arbor/">Here's their roundup of top Ann Arbor blogs and bloggers; Vacuum is listed as a top local blog. </a> They describe what I write about as follows:</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/">Vacuum </a>-
A love of the neighborhood library and awareness of local school news,
political happenings, tech updates and the occasional recipe make this
eclectic blog a must read. </p></blockquote><p>It's always interesting to figure out what other people thing you are doing - if you are trying to maintain a laser-like coherent focus on being eclectic, it's hard to know what to do next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm happy that recipes make for good filler.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, here's perhaps better sources for any of the components that go into this effort:</p>

<p>Libraries: my main library blog is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a> which spun out of Vacuum about two years ago.&nbsp; Locally the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> site has a bunch of blogs inside it including <a href="http://www.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/302">a good one on local history</a>, Globally my short list for library inspiration includes <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">Jenny Levine's The Shifted Librarian</a>, <a href="http://tametheweb.com/">Michael Stephens writing Tame The Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">self-described library geek John Blyberg's eponymous blog.</a></p>

<p>Local school news: the <a href="http://www.burnsparkpto.org/">Burns Park Elementary PTO has a web site and newsletter</a>&nbsp; which I clip from regularly (mostly, it seems, to remind myself of things in the future).&nbsp; The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> has good coverage of school meetings which I am never ever likely to attend regularly.&nbsp; The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arborparents">very busy arborparents mailing list </a>connects parents across town and across the area - more news than I can readily absorb but always something of interest and a very helpful bunch for asking questions of.</p>

<p>Political happenings:&nbsp; I think the outside.in people were keyed on to my elections coverage; rather than take any kind of political stance visibly here at all in any tedious partisan way, I try to always collect <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-michi.html">as much details as I can on elections including sample ballots and polling place locations and times.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The best sources for that are <a href="http://potifos.com/polygon/">county clerk Larry Kestenbaum's occasional blogging</a>, plus a certain degree of digging through municipal web sites.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/services/Pages/E-mailAlertSubscription.aspx">City of Ann Arbor's email alert service</a> helps a lot.</p>

<p>Tech updates: This leaves broad room for interpretation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the useful but sometimes tedious realm, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme is the only tech news tracker you need to listen to the silicon valley echo chamber</a>.&nbsp; Collecting more local tech news is helped by<a href="http://concentratemedia.com/"> Issue Media Group's Concentrate</a> and by <a href="http://www.wwj.com/pages/317228.php">Matt Roush's Great Lakes IT Report</a>, both of which are eager to write about local stuff.&nbsp; My <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 weekly lunch group and the mailing list that goes with it</a> are my local collection source for interesting people and projects and tech (and note that quite a bit of this is pre-market projects not yet in the Silicon Valley radar).</p>

<p>The occasional recipe: The relentlessly practical answer to how this gets done is &quot;blog what you eat&quot;; if you are persistent about that, you get ready-made menu plans for next year around the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, I turn to <a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com">Kate Remen-Wait's Four Obsessions blog</a> when I need a menu idea,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com">Kitchenchick for reviews of local restaurants</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefarmersmarketer.com/">The Farmer's Marketer for a market list from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a>.&nbsp; Globally the technique is &quot;google cooking&quot; or &quot;twitter cooking&quot; where you simply type in a list of ingredients into either search box and hope someone has something inspiring. </p>

<p>Eclectica.&nbsp; It's imporant to be fed a steady diet of things which are interesting; if <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/creativity_is_a.html">creativity is an import-export game</a>, then this is the import side of that.&nbsp; Reliably I pull from<a href="http://delicious.com/network/vielmetti"> my network on delicious</a> for great weird ideas.&nbsp; There are a few weblogs that specialize in the eclectic, most notably <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/">Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets: A Compendium of Eclectica for Epopts.</a></p>

<p>so there you go.</p>
