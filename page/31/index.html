<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The book is my&#0160;<a href="https://leanpub.com/michigan-foia" target="_self">No-Nonsense Guide to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a>, which I&#39;m publishing (early) and updating (as its written) <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/writing-and-publishing-early-with-leanpub.html" target="_self">using Leanpub</a>. Here&#39;s what I sent out to subscribers - all four of them! - this morning.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to have a chance to keep working on this, since even the smallest amount of money from new sales covers the direct costs &#0160;of coffee to do the writing.</p>
<p>Release Notes
</p>
<blockquote>April 9, 2013.<br /><br />This release updates the first 7 chapters of the book plus the introduction. Most of the changes are to fill in gaps, small reorganizations of the text, and line edits; there&#39;s not a ton of new original materials. Chapters 8 through to the end are unchanged.<br /><br />One of the things that&#39;s new in the Michigan FOIA world is that Muckrock (Appendix A) now supports FOIA requests to a number of Ann Arbor cities. My first trial with this worked a little bit well, and I&#39;m going to keep trying to improve how that system works so that I get the best writeup of it.<br /><br />A document trove from a recent FOIA request is a log of all FOIA requests to the City of Ann Arbor over the span of two months. Look for a future set of edits to expand the &quot;sample requests&quot; considerably based on that collection, since I&#39;m still digesting them.<br /><br />If anyone has tried the &quot;send to Kindle&quot; feature, let me know how it went.<br /><br />As always, if you have any questions, contact me at&#0160;<a href="mailto:edward.vielmetti@gmail.com" target="_blank">edward.vielmetti@gmail.com</a>&#0160;or&#0160;<a href="tel:%2B1%20734%20330%202465" target="_blank">+1 734 330 2465</a>.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Ed</blockquote></p>

      <p>A lovely day for a foolish parade. We were out and got some choice standing places in the springtime sunshine, and when the parade got to be too much for the youngest of the party, we went out for hot chocolate and a muffin.</p>
<p>This photo gives some idea of the fun. I didn&#39;t get a picture of my favorite puppet, which was a camera complete with &quot;flash&quot;. This was definitely a time to get photos with as much resolution as you can.</p>

Their energy was amazing — enthusiastic, creative, welcoming, friendly, and, as always, totally Foolish! Also, the weather more than cooperated, which isn’t something we in Ann Arbor take for granted. &quot;</p>

<p>According to Ken Campbell, North Quad’s maintenance mechanic, a broken joint pipe on the building’s fire suppression system was responsible for the flooding. The break occurred in the East Stairwell on the fourth floor of the building, he said. When the pipe lost pressure, the system automatically turned the water pump on to add pressure, exacerbating the flow from the three-inch pipe.</p>
<p>Campbell estimated that “thousands and thousands” of gallons poured from the pipe before it was turned off 20 minutes later.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Do I understand this? No. But this is a blog called Vacuum, and this is my service to that task.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values. As a result, the inherent characteristics of vacuum, like the speed of light, may not be a constant after all, but fluctuate. Meanwhile, in another study, Gerd Leuchs and Luis L. Sánchez-Soto, from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Light in Erlangen, Germany, suggest that physical constants, such as the speed of light and the so-called impedance of free space, are indications of the total number of elementary particles in nature.&#0160;<br /><br />Read more at:&#0160;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-03-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-speed-of-light-fluctuations.html#jCp">http://phys.org/news/2013-03-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-speed-of-light-fluctuations.html#jCp</a></p>

      <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html" target="_self">OneTab</a> to help manage things.</p>
<p>The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down.</p>
<p>The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">pinboard</a> that tab) and then close it out. When I&#39;m done, there will be no open tabs, and everything will have moved forward just a little bit.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If you, like me, are interested in how systems work and when they fail, here are three good sources to look at from the internet persective on global network behavior.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages" target="_self">outages mailing list</a> (outages at outages.org) describes itself as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary goal of this mailing list (&quot;outages&quot;) is for outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns. Some also believe that LEC&#39;s and IXC&#39;s also like this model as they no longer have to air their dirty laundry. Then again, this mailing list is not about making anyone look bad, its all about information sharing and keeping network operators &amp; end users abreast on the situation as close to real-time information as possible in order to assess and respond to major outage such as routing voice/data via different carriers which may directly or indirectly impact us and our customers. A reliable communications network is essential in times of crisis.&#0160;<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s always good information about bad news to be found here, with a typical exchange being &quot;I lost some circuits to city X&quot; and the reply &quot;Company Y has a fiber cut in city Z&quot;.&#0160;</p>
<p>A second excellent source of global routing information about failures and reconfigurations of the global internet is the weblog that&#39;s written by the company Renesys. The <a href="http://renesys.com/blog/" target="_self">Renesys Blog</a>&#0160;has as of this writing details about network connectivity problems to North and South Korea, a fiber cut in the Black Sea that disrupted traffic as far away as Oman (3000+ km away), and details of a submarine cable landing in Cuba.&#0160;</p>
<p>Finally - though there is not really a finally in this world where part of the Internet is always under repair - there is a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/115136140203018391796" target="_self">&quot;Postmortems&quot; discussion group on Google Plus</a> where reports come in after the fact of people describing just what went wrong with their complex system and (usually) what they plan to do next to avoid the next round of similar failures. From squirrel-induced cascading power failures to denial of service attacks to runaway email systems, there&#39;s a new lesson to be learned from each after-action review of failure.</p>
<p>All of these groups overlap somewhat with the <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/" target="_self">RISKS Digest</a>, one of the oldest mailing lists still around on the internet, that covers risks to the public from computing technology.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Grand_Traverse_Pie_Company" target="_self">linked</a>) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly.</p>
<p>The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. I've written before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/pocket-twitter-a-suitable-replacement-for-the-internet-when-offline.html" target="_self">Pocket Twitter</a>; there's also a very effective <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">Pocket Issue Tracker</a> where you write down things to do and then re-sync them with your online issue tracker once you are online again.</p>
<p>There is technology that will help this state of interrupted connectivity, and I use it when I can. Of all of the applications that I use, <a href="http://mail.google.com" target="_self">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_self">Evernote</a> are the two that have the best developed clients that can intelligently buffer things when you're offline. If I have my laptop and no connectivity, I can also use "git" and "vim" to work on my writing projects, knowing that a "git push origin master" command will resync when I'm ready to update changes.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was no internet and every application worked well offline. Netnews was delivered one batch at a time, and you'd read it while the modem was quiet; email, if it was important enough, might warrant a long distance call to deliver. Now, when the net is down or flaky you should still be able to get work done. And yes, I should really get a data plan for my new phone so that I don't have to rely on the quality of random coffee shops for personal productivity.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time.</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://mysleepbot.com/" target="_self">SleepBot</a> (http://mysleepbot.com/) and <a href="http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/" target="_self">SleepTime</a> (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone's accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you're not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed.</p>
<p>I haven't used SleepTime yet, but SleepBot seemed to work this morning. That is to say, it did wake me up at 7:00 alert enough to notice that I was awake, but since I didn't have anything else planned for that early hour I caught some more sleep.</p>
<p>The only hitch I really see is that overnight is when I like to charge the phone, and by keeping the phone under the pillow it gets in the way of starting the next day with a full battery.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to hear any reviews or recommendations from anyone who's tried these over a longer period of time. I have a faint goal of getting to bed earlier and getting up earlier, and if this can be accomplished with the help of a tiny habit to put my phone under my pillow before bedtime, let's try that out and see what works.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it.</p>
<p>The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun. At some level of thrashing, the chance of an out-and-out crash gets higher, and then I&#39;m suddenly looking at a blank screen.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/" target="_self">OneTab</a>&#0160;(<a href="http://www.one-tab.com/" target="_self">http://www.one-tab.com/)</a>, a Chrome extension that corrals your tabs by doing something fairly straightforward. Rather than keeping hidden tabs open, it suspends the tabs you&#39;re not using, freeing up system memory. Restoring a tab set isn&#39;t that hard and isn&#39;t that slow, and the ones you do have open go faster. In my admittedly brief experience with it, I&#39;ve managed to avoid having the system start to page, and the tabs that would otherwise chew through memory in the background (looking at you, Google Analytics) get stuck aside for later review.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only one who found this and liked it - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/eby" target="_self">Ryan Eby (@eby)</a>&#0160;for the link, after I complained about a Chrome crash.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario. You and your team work hard to use a
new piece of collaboration software that offers some unique features
that are suited either to the work at hand or that appeal to your
sense of novelty. The tool works great and you get into it, using
some of the more complex parts of the system to great advantage.
Then the system&rsquo;s owners send out the dreaded self-congratulatory
message saying that they have been acquired by a big company, or
some beleagured product manager announces that their system is being
sunsetted. You need to move.</p>

<p>Moving turns out to be hard. Once upon a time when the only thing
you needed to move was electronic mail, there were only a handful
of email file formats, and though they were incompletely specified
you could readily move among them. Moving between news readers was
just a matter of reusing your .newsrc file. Life was simpler then
(cue sad violins).</p>

<p>The situation now is much more complicated. If you are extremely
lucky, the system you have has an export file that is the same as
its import file, and someone has built a faithful clone of your
original service for you to migrate to. That was the case in my
move from <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_%28website%29"
rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Delicious (website)">Delicious</a>
to <a  href="http://www.pinboard.in" rel="homepage" target="_blank"
title="Pinboard">Pinboard</a>. If you&rsquo;re keeping a weblog,
though, things can get really unhappy really fast, and a friend to
recently migrated from <a  href="http://www.posterous.com"
rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Posterous">Posterous</a> to
<a  href="http://wordpress.org" rel="homepage" target="_blank"
title="WordPress">WordPress</a> went through gyrations that I&rsquo;m
not sure that I would have tolerated.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem, I suppose, is that the more innovating the
service the less likely that its data is structured so simply that
you can drop it in to someting else. Brand new user interfaces, the
ones that attract traffic because of the ever present need for
novelty, also have novel data structures. Watch out when getting
into something new that you may find it easier to start than to
stop.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.griefnet.org/">GriefNet</a>&#0160;is an Internet community approach to on line grief support, providing support to people working through loss and grief issues of all kinds. Cendra Lynn is the leader of the organization, and I had some small technological part in starting it back in 1993 when the appropriate technology of the day was Gopher, not the World Wide Web. The system hosts dozens of moderated mailing lists for people who share a common loss like the death of a spouse or the loss of a child.</p>
<p>I had a nice conversation with Cendra last night about how hard it is to build a community where people who are going through a lot can have a place where they can trust each other enough to share what are not easy feelings to share. It takes active moderation, careful planning, and a constant attention to the details of online identity. The technology is not fancy - they are using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html" target="_self">Mailman</a> mailer, which is now 15 years in development - and the key community insight is that it&#39;s utterly crucial to keep people&#39;s identity pseudonomous (first name only) so that people can focus on working through grief and not get distracted by the rest of people&#39;s real lives. This is so completely unlike the over-sharing Google Plus and overtly commercialized Facebook as to be worthy of note.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on <a href="http://am1610.org" target="_self">http://am1610.org</a> . The show is &quot;The Strait&quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&#39;s always worth a listen.&#0160;</p>
<p>Some day I&#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it.</p>
