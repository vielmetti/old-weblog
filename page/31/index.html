<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.</p>
<p>The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.</p>
<p>Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. The Canton District Library does have an installation of LibraryThing for Libraries, their OPAC integration product, which lets you check availability of a book straight from LibraryThing. The lack of a direct link means that to find a book in the AADL that I have on my screen in LibraryThing I have to click a few more times. I suppose that&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to tag and categorize books that you don&#39;t own yourself, but only have collected them from the library? There was a time when I tagged things everywhere I found them - photos on Flickr, web sites on Delicious - but these days that doesn&#39;t seem so important. I like seeing other people&#39;s tags, especially for works that are unfamiliar, but it hardly seems essential to do it for my own use unless there&#39;s some list I&#39;m trying to put together. When did tagging cease being fun?</p>
<p>I&#39;m spending some of my time on the site deleting books that I no longer even remember having read or that I no longer wish to remember. That should result in better recommendations, and maybe a chance to reread something that would have been worth remembering. My use of the site peaked in 2008 so there&#39;s not as much recent coverage as I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>The recommendations from LibraryThing are really quite good, and they are even better for reflecting which of the books you&#39;ve already read. The site generates ten recommendations based on other people&#39;s reading patterns, and it reminds you that you&#39;ve read some of the ones on that list with a checkmark.</p>
<p>I wish I read more books and fewer web pages.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. </p>
<p>I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way.</p>
<p>I weary of scanning the net looking for the next space to insert a little bit of pithy commentary. Write long to find some free space to wander around in and write on and then edit before it is launched out into the world. If there are pithy bits buried inside, so much the better - but the goal is not to string together a sequence of quips and quotes but instead to explore a possibility space and bump up against some creative edges.</p>
<p>Writing long is a contemplative activity. Sort through the main theme and find other related ideas to explore. A short paragraph invites adding an extra sentence in the middle to clarify, expound, or to share some added insight. Allow space to type in to allow for some wandering through the world of ideas without necessarily having to come&#0160;to the point right away.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the wandering in your own thought-space that is appealing, even if you decide for the sake of the reader that you need to eventually trim a paragraph that doesn&#39;t fit. Write that extra paragraph in order to get to the good paragraph that awaits after it&#39;s been written. Write some extra words so that your inner editor has something to improve at the end of the effort. Adding in more words lets you explore a variety of turns of a phrase, and the slow process of selecting from multiple alternatives may suggest additional lines of reasoning. &#0160;Surplus words are there for a purpose, even though their purpose may only be to be removed.</p>
<p>The careful slow process of editing works better when there&#39;s a lot to start from. It&#39;s not enough to have the right words; they have to be in the right order. Collecting lots of words give you a chance to sift through them with a clear eye after the original collection is made, and pull out the better ones and leave some others for a later time. In the process of doing this, you might end up rewriting the same phrase multiple times. Keep trying until the suitable phrase emerges, and then collect up the debris that remains around it to see if there&#39;s one more thing you wanted to say.</p>
<p>Editing is a process of adding or deleting words to meet a set of constraints. If you have too many words in a sentence, too many sentences in a paragraph, or too many paragraphs on the page, the constraint leads you to omit needless words. If the page is empty and you have a goal to fill it up, the need is to expand, augment, and add to the words on the page - even if you have some eventual hope of hitting a word limit which will motivate you to trim back the extra verbiage. Once you have hit your word count, there&#39;s a balance point where every extra word demands that another word be removed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been ruminating over the phrase &quot;adjacent possible&quot;, which stems from Stuart Kauffman who useds it to think about the world of evolutionary biology. The world builds on what it has, and the more aware we are of all of the possibilities in our world the more adjacent opportunities can present themselves. From the perspective of writing, the adjacent possible word is every word that could be added or subtracted from a partially finished work to make it better.&#0160;</p>
<p>This lends itself to thinking about writing via the adjacent possible. Get some words out on the page, and then use that as your raw materials to remix, rework, or rearrange until you have something better than the original. In your first draft, don&#39;t obsess about getting every sentence perfect. Use the initial writing effort as a chance to explorate some phrases and to try out a few unfamiliar terms of art. Write some extra words, so that you can delete them later.&#0160;</p>
<p>If I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you a thousand times: repetition is the very soul of the net. If you have a good idea, why say it only once? Repeat it over and over again in different guises until your reader is thoroughly struck through with the notion. Say it, change a word, and say it once again. Delete words to make room for others that are better.</p>
<p>The slow process of accumulating words takes time. If you are fortunate, you start out with a set of ideas that allows for exploration of a variety of perspectives and alternatives, and a structure that gives you some guidance for what comes first and what happens next. Even a mechanical exploration of that possibility space can generate the necessary length of a first draft that works to reach the distance, with a few extra words to spare that can be trimmed later. Keep writing until you discover what it is that you should have been focusing on from the first, so that you can go back later and carve out the good parts for more prominent display.</p>
<p>At some point, the page is full, and it&#39;s time to bring the exploration to an end. You have more than your fair allotment of words, and it&#39;s time to cut, not add. The extra words that you drop out are scaffolding, the extra space that you built in order to find the permanent space that you really wanted. Even if the total is over what you had originally planned to write, count on the process of addition by subtraction and carve out the good words from the big pile that you have built.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means.</p>
<p>The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that.</p>
<p>What I think it might mean is working with my todo list - <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">which is currently in a github issue tracker</a> - and approaching it in an associative fashion rather than going strictly linearly through it. The goal is to make progress on a variety of things, but not necessarily to work down one long deterministic ordered list. I&#39;ve organized my github list so that pretty much everything has a tag or two, and thus I can turn a 100-long list into a 10-long list and crunch through it without it feeling infinite.</p>
<p>
Ideally you find yourself in a situation where there are a few easy things that have been languishing for a while that right now you just know that you can do, so you get up from your computer and you do them. This works especially well when you&#39;ve salted away some easy, but not for now tasks into the list so that they can get done at some impromptu opportune moment.</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that this approach to self-tasking is related to the concept of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/04/marginally_usef.html" target="_self">structured procrastination</a>. My 2005 self had the idea that it was good to write things down that you weren&#39;t ready to do just yet, so that you could randomly (!) generate suggestions that would be productive when you had some down time that you weren&#39;t ready to focus on the big things.</p>

The project showcases their work and funds a field trip for the students. This year&#39;s 2013 calendar features pictures of Marquette, the <a href="http://www.originalbutterflyhouse.com/" target="_self">butterfly house on Mackinac Island</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeYoung_Family_Zoo" target="_self">DeYoung Family Zoo</a> in Wallace. The cost is $20 and it&#39;s available <a href="http://marquette.revtrak.net/tek9.asp?pg=products&amp;specific=jnkqnoo0" target="_self">for sale online</a>.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&#39;s trip.</p>
<p>I asked Cindy DePetro from MAHS about the calendar and the responses they&#39;ve gotten from it. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to get praised over the quality of the photos, but our biggest praise is that most people feel like they receive a little piece of home when they see our calendars. We get many repeat customers, and our calendars travel all over the world. Thus far, we know they are being sent to Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany and China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tis the season!</p>

<p>So come, &quot;check out&quot; a &quot;living&#0160;book&quot;,&#0160;and learn about your community&#39;s religions and spiritualities. &#0160;Each story is unique; each journey inspiring; each path revealing.&#0160;</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-15-issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity/">&#34;issue tracker&#34;, a github project for personal productivity</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while I try to organize my life. Usually the effort is temporary, with one system working really well as I download all of my tasks out of my inbox and into it, and then slowly languishing until it fails for some mysterious reason to actually get me to do things more efficiently.</p>
<p>You only need to look at my <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/productivity/" target="_self">productivity</a> category here to marvel at how ideas come and go.</p>
<p>The latest approach to this, with a test time of all of three days before I write about how wonderful it is, is to use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_self">github</a> as an issue tracker. Now it helps that I&#39;m also using github as an issue tracker for a couple of other projects, so it&#39;s not a big learning curve, and the more familiar I get with the tool the better off I suspect I&#39;ll be.</p>
<p>Issues in github look more or less like items in a conferencing system that has single threaded conversations. The title of the issue is the most searchable part of it, so it pays to have good titles. Each issue can refer to other issues by number (e.g. #4) so you don&#39;t have to worry that renaming an issue forces you to update links. Issues can be in exactly one milestone, and milestones have due dates which you are reminded about. Issues also have one or more categories and the categories are color coded.</p>
<p>I&#39;m approaching this along the lines that the traditional &quot;inbox zero&quot; or &quot;get things done&quot; approach wants to have it work - your inboxes, all of them, stay as empty as they can all of the time, and the big long issue tracker list is the semi-infinite comprehensive list of everything there is to do. You work your way through that list using some subset of it to prompt activity, and you tick off tasks as completed when they&#39;re eventually done. Anything that comes into an empty inbox gets dispatched promptly so that the inbox stays empty, but you don&#39;t and can&#39;t do everything on your todo list at once.</p>
<p>So far so good? The cost is non-zero, which means that if I decide to give up on this I have the motivating force of a few dollars a month to either prod me into action or use as a budget for some other tool. At worst I get better at using github for a while.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.</p>
<p>The examples that come to mind share some common traits.</p>
<ol>
<li>there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other</li>
<li>for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least.</li>
<li>the successful communicator is good at more than one network and can move between them, pulling ideas and people along for the ride.</li>
<li>somewhere at the center of the network there&#39;s a culturally appropriate publication process that generates an external memory of what has been communicated, whether that&#39;s a ritual behavior, a database, something like a wiki, or some book or printed artifact.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that if you can manage to satisfy all four of these factors that you can get alongwith a wide range of technologies. The working amateur radio clubs that I know fit the bill,&#0160;as do some networks that are coordinated by prolific bloggers or that have sprung up&#0160;around civic wikis.</p>
<p>The thing that emerged from writing this was realizing that ritual behavior could be the&#0160;external memory that you get from community leadership, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily&#0160;need to be written down. Just knowing that there&#39;s some component of a community that&#0160;gathers in an orderly way regularly and that follows a pattern that&#39;s not much different&#0160;from the time before, that&#39;s a powerful synchronizing pulse that can feed all sorts of&#0160;other informal collaboration.</p>
Thanks to Kevin Doyle Jones for the conversation that led to this.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I just got done reading Francis Spufford&#39;s &quot;Red Plenty&quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.</p>
<p>Some other reviews of the work, so that I don&#39;t miss them:</p>
<p>Jo Walton: <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/the-glorious-terrible-strange-ussr-francis-spuffords-red-plenty" target="_self">The Glorious, Terrible, Strange USSR: Francis Spufford’s&#0160;<em>Red Plenty</em></a></p>
<p><em>It’s not SF. It’s not really&#0160;<em>fiction</em>, though it’s not non-fiction either. It’s something strangely between the two, a fictionalised non-fiction book about the Soviet Dream. Reading it partakes of some of the pleasures of reading especially geeky SF, and some of the pleasure of reading solid well-written nonfiction on a fascinating subject. It’s about history, economics, how technology and ideology interact, and how theory and practice are different, with examples. What it’s most like is reading an extended version of one of Neal Stephenson’s more adorable infodumps, only with footnotes and a proper end.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>Crooked Timber put together a <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RedPlenty.pdf" target="_self">Red Plenty reader</a> with about a dozen essays.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2010/08/red_plenty_by_f.shtml" target="_self">Adam Roberts writes in Strange Horizons</a>, a science fiction review:</p>
<p><em>To take the first first. When people talk about &quot;science fiction&quot; the science they are thinking of (as it might be) physics, or chemistry, or perhaps biology. But that&#39;s a narrow way of taking things. The science in&#0160;<cite>Red Plenty</cite>&#0160;is economics, and reading the book will teach you a tremendous amount about the logic (and illogic) of running a planned economy on the Soviet scale. The speculative portion of the science here is the striking attempt by Vitalevich and Nemchinov to modify the catastrophically inflexible Soviet economic model with a mechanism—&quot;shadow prices&quot;—better able to match supply to demand without simply instituting Capitalist &quot;free&quot; markets. Perhaps it sounds dry, but I found it fascinating, and precisely as science-fictional as a proposed new spaceship drive or cloning technology.</em></p>

      </h3>
      <p>See <a href="http://www.toledowiki.net" target="_self">toledowiki.net</a>&#0160;for a city wiki for Toledo, Ohio. As of this writing it has 113 users, who have created 362 pages about the city.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Coffee_Shops" target="_self">coffee shops</a> that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Flyers" target="_self">flyers</a> collection lets you see what&#39;s on the bulletin boards around town.</p>
<p>My working knowledge of Toledo is bounded by the few places that I routinely visit - the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Museum_of_Art" target="_self">art museum</a>, the ball field where the <a href="http://toledowiki.net/Toledo_Mud_Hens" target="_self">Mud Hens</a> play, and a few routine stops along the freeway near the turnpike exit. It&#39;s incredibly helpful to have a local guide to the whole rest of the town to make it possible to think about alternative destinations the next time I visit.</p>

      <p>The new Consumers Energy Power Outage map is at&#0160;<a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap" target="_self">http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap</a>. Here&#39;s a map with the service territory marked - there are no outages to speak of on the map right now. The page automatically switches to a mobile web view if you are coming from a smart mobile device (IOS and Android; not so much Blackberry). There are three views: one for individual detailed outages, one at a city level, and one at a county level. According to the webinar I&#39;m listening to now, the detailed outages are running in real time, and the city/county overview is delayed up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>For the media, this augments but does not replace the existing direct contacts to Consumers Energy public relations representatives who can answer questions.</p>
<p>For storms in Michigan that come from west to east, it will be useful to watch to see how badly the storm affects Consumers before it gets to Detroit Edison territory.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards.</p>
<p>I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month.
</p>

<p><blockquote>I am responding to your request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act received November 6, 2012 for a copy of monthly logs of confiscated signs for 2012. Your request is granted.  The number of confiscated signs for the 2012 year to date is 285.  The number if signs collected each month of this year is as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>January - 37 <br />February - 41 <br />March - 23 <br />April - 55 <br />May - 65 <br />June - 82 <br />July - 63 <br />August - 114 <br />September - 34 <br />October - 206 <br />November to date - 105</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s certainly a followup request that tries to go deeper into detail for each of these sign confiscations, but what I thought was interesting was the definite connection between the political season and the number of signs taken down.</p></p>

      <p><p><a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/project_management/Pages/EastStadiumBridges.aspx" target="_self">Ann Arbor&#39;s Stadium Bridges are reopening</a> on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 after about a year of being closed for reconstruction, according to messages from the city. The latest information that I have is that the bridge will open at 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but that there will be intermittent lane closures for the rest of the week to finish up the job. City engineer Mike Nearing emailed me to say that &quot;at least one sidewalk will be open while our contractor works to clean and finish the work on the roadway and bridges.&quot;</p>

<p>Our neighborhood had a block party to celebrate the end of construction last weekend, and AnnArbor.com was on it. Distinguished visitors included Rep. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/John_Dingell" target="_self">John Dingell</a> and Mayor <a href="http://arborwiki.org/John_Hieftje" target="_self">John Hieftje</a>, plus a host of neighborhood kids (my boys included) who ran, scootered, and bicycled on the brand new structure.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll all be glad that the detours that made our west side neighbors seem like they were far, far away will be gone, and as an added surprise bonus the bridge will be ready for the final football game vs. Iowa.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A Death Cafe is a safe place where people get together to talk about death and have tea and delicious cake. The idea originated in Switzerland as the &quot;cafe mortel&quot;, is organized from the UK, and has spread to France, Australia and the US. Events are low key, held in public places, and are safe and informal.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Death Cafe is the first of these events to be held in Michigan. It is hosted by Merilynne Rush, who is a retired nurse and home birth midwife and who has been active locally in at home death care and natural burials since 2008. I talked to her today about it and she said that people &quot;don&#39;t have enough chance to talk about death in their life.&quot;</p>
<p>The first meeting of the group is at Eastern Accents on Saturday, November 17, 2012 from 10:00 a.m. to noon. Subsequent meetings are on the third Saturday of each month, except for the December meetup which is on December 8. There is no fee for attending, but please RSVP to Merilynne at <strong>msh.rush@gmail.com</strong>&#0160;so that she and the restaurant can make plans.</p>

<p>Some evidence of sightings:</p>
<p>The Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/Aurora_Alerts">@Aurora_Alerts</a> is active when the Northern Lights are active, and it gives very short term forecasts of activity. The higher the Kp number, the brighter the aurora.</p>
<p>The Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/AuroraMAX">@AuroraMAX</a> belongs to the night sky camera that took the snapshot above.

      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://pinterest.com/vielmetti/maps/" target="_self">My Pinterest feed is all maps, all the time</a>. It&#39;s like I discovered rec.arts.maps and jumped right in.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t try to make Pinterest a simple copy of anything else that I do online, in part because there&#39;s really nothing similar to it to copy. It&#39;s ridiculously easy to make a copy of an image and attach a few words to it, and there&#39;s not any real problem with posting too much stuff to it because when you&#39;re on topic it all just flows down the page nicely.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to collect a few people on Pinterest who share my love of maps, and it&#39;s nice to see their map-collecting work in my feed there. What I miss, though, is bringing that love of maps back here - there&#39;s certainly a story behind most of those maps, and perhaps one in ten deserves a longer essay to go with it and some spot in my own permanent blog collection.</p>
<p>The biggest weird thing about Pinterest is how readily people make copies of copyrighted materials. It&#39;s like the rules are different there - fair use, perhaps? - and within the system no one seems to care very much if an image is copyrighted or creative commons or public domain. I&#39;m sure that speeds up the user interface a lot, but it makes me think twice before just yanking anything from within Pinterest and placing it somewhere else without doing some research.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s one of the many maps that I have found that I wouldn&#39;t have collected any other way - I&#39;ve done the Pinterest &quot;embed&quot; here, just to simplify what would otherwise be a multi-step upload and include process. The only complaint with the map is that &quot;Wal-Mart Fans&quot; should probably be &quot;Trader Joes Fans&quot;.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-12-how-to-write-for-multiple-social-media-channels-at-once/">How to write for multiple social media channels at once</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective?</p>
<p>One suggestion, from long-time blogger <a href="http://prentissriddle.com/" target="_self">Prentiss Riddle</a>, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks. You can then push out whatever you want to write wherever and whenever you desire, and still own the original content in a place that you can control.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-manning/2/b58/469" target="_self">Bill Manning</a> suggests <a href="http://streamified.com/" target="_self">Streamified</a>, which is an aggregator that pulls together a variety of inbound streams and presents them attractively. &quot;Add all of your&#0160;<a href="http://streamified.com/#social_streams">social streams</a>&#0160;and watch them all come together in one place.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://about.me/ryanburns" target="_self">Ryan Burns</a> suggests <a href="http://bufferapp.com/" target="_self">Buffer</a> (bufferapp), which lets you write once and then push out those posts to multiple places. &quot;Easily add great articles, pictures and videos to your Buffer and we automagically share them for you through the day!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/juliewbee" target="_self">Julie Weatherbee</a> notes (quite correctly) that simply replicating the same text in Twitter and Facebook is folly, because it doesn&#39;t play to the strengths of either medium. Twitter&#39;s @ references and # hashtags look foolish in a Facebook status, and if you have someone following you on both systems, they&#39;ll find the duplicate efforts irritating. Twitter&#39;s rapid fire, real time updates can overwhelm a Facebook feed easily.</p>
<p>The real challenge, though, is in designing for the writing style. The enforced 140 character limit of Twitter forces you to be pithy, but it also gets in the way of writing coherent sentences and paragraphs. Perhaps, as I have tried to do here, I can repurpose the original Twitter posting and use it as the lead paragraph of a longer essay that lives on Typepad and is excerpted for a Facebook post. As a writing design that&#39;s a hard constraint, but as usual, the discipline of constraints lends itself to better writing if you can pull it off.</p>
