      </h3>
      It's winter, your hands see cold so you are wearing gloves, but you need at least a few fingers free for your mobile phone.  What designs work?

The gloves I am wearing now have a flap to expose a sort of fingerless Mitten, and if I fold things right I can expose just two index fingers.  I could imagine thumbs free gloves too.

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m writing this from my mobile phone, using typepad mobile to post with. As a blog post interface it works pretty well.
</p><p>
There is one key piece that is missing to make it more helpful: a search function. I don&#39;t see a way to easily search through my past posts from the phone to go back and update and edit one of them. It is easy to get to the last 5 posts but the next option is to list all 1900 entries, no thanks.
</p><p>
As a small corollary to that, I don&#39;t see an easy way to add a comment to a post either; in some cases a comment is better that an edit.
</p><p>
Look for more posts from the bus.
</p><p>
NOTES afterward:
</p><p>
The default edit mode is HTML, which explains why the first iteration of this post didn&#39;t have paragraph breaks. Fixed in post-production.
</p><p>
The application I actually used was the <a href="http://i.typepad.com/">web-based iPhone Typepad interface</a>, which works fine on the Blackberry. There is a <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-blackberry.html">Blackberry native interface</a> which I haven&#39;t tried yet.</p>

      <p>You&#39;re at a meeting, somewhere, and you want to quietly and unobtrusively take meeting notes or some other record of the meeting while it&#39;s happening, and you have a mobile phone but nothing else.</p><p>What tool or application do you use?</p><p><a href="http://m.twitter.com">Mobile twitter</a>.&#0160; Twitter your short notes out to the world, or use a direct message to some bot of some kind that collects and gathers the notes for you.&#0160;&#0160; Twitter&#39;s mobile interface is fast, simple, and reasonably complete.&#0160; Down side: no easy way to look up something about the person who just introduced themselves.</p><p><a href="http://m.facebook.com">Mobile Facebook</a>.&#0160; Write on the wall of people (or your own wall) as notes come up, and then somehow reconstruct it afterwards.&#0160; The people search tool is very handy for looking folks up on the fly, and you can send someone a followup about some question while you&#39;re still at the event.&#0160; Down side: Slow enough that if people are moving fast you don&#39;t keep up.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.com/blog/2006/04/75.html">Mobile wiki (Socialtext Miki)</a>.&#0160; Keep notes on a scratch pad on a wiki that you edit on your mobile device. A perfectly good text input box and it makes refining your notes into something longer very easy (and you can go back and figure out more about what you missed). &#0160;&#0160; Down side: no lookup on the fly, so if you fumble someone&#39;s name you can&#39;t look it up.</p><p>Other mobile contact network and social network managers - both Plaxo and LinkedIn have mobile versions, and I haven&#39;t tried to figure out how to use those while standing up and listening to be a bit more informed.</p><p>Notable here is that there isn&#39;t a single Google mobile tool in the arsenal.&#0160; The Blackberry native mail client is better than the Google Mail java client, and almost anyone can have a text box open, but if there&#39;s a mobile Orkut then my world of people doesn&#39;t use it.</p><p>If I had two hands free to do this I probably would have used delicious as a part of the process - I&#39;ve gone to a bunch of lecture or seminar type events where my pattern is to google what the speaker says and delicious the results, and if the net is fast enough where that is you can almost do that in close enough to real time to keep up.&#0160;&#0160; But that&#39;s too much and too rude to do in anything other than a lecture situation.</p><p>Paper has some tremendous uses here - one recent event I went to I used some of <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3252489">Dave Gray&#39;s visual thinking skills that he&#39;s taught and put into his new book </a>and did things like sketch what the speakers were wearing in addition to taking notes on what they were saying.&#0160;&#0160; I have a much clearer visual memory of that event, but I don&#39;t remember anyone&#39;s names.</p><p>A work in process to be sure.&#0160; There were 11 tables full of people, and I got almost everyone&#39;s names, and didn&#39;t quite catch everything I hoped to catch; thanks everyone for lunch.&#0160; The conclusion of the question at the table - would you buy a car from a bankrupt auto company? - is that most people would be worried about service and availability of maintenance and parts, and that a <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/high_performance/features_classic_cars/sail_to_the_u_s_a_in_a_chevrolet_feature">Cuban mechanic</a> would be someone to keep in your rolodex, and that if the worst happens at least we can look forward to an expanded <a href="http://jalopnik.com/tag/2008-orphan-car-show/">orphan car show in Ypsi. </a></p>

<p>Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant
individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&#39;s
predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond
the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page
discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&#39;re talking
about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why
diversity trumps ability. Come and learn why progress depends as much
on our collective differences as it does on our individual IQ scores!

We consider Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent research
across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, is processed, and changes over time. However, there is
mounting evidence that processes of language acquisition, use and
change are not independent from one another but are facets of the same
complex adaptive system. A conference on this theme at UMich in
November 2008 brought together international scholars active in their
recognition of complexity in their respective areas, ranging from
language usage, structure, and change, sociolinguistics, cognitive
linguistics, anthropology, language evolution, complex systems, first
language acquisition, second language acquisition, psycholinguistics
and language processing, language education, individual differences,
and language testing. For details see <a href="http://elicorpora.info/LLC" target="_blank">http://elicorpora.info/LLC</a>.</p><p>
Each week as a class we (i) view the podcast recording of their
presentation, (ii) read their associated journal article, and (iii)
discuss this theme.</p><p>
This course crosses different branches of psychology, linguistics,
education, complex systems, and cognitive science, and we welcome
students of these and related perspectives.</p><p>
Students will be expected to read and participate in the discussion of
all topics, write a term paper on one of these topics discussed with
the instructor (either a literature review or a research proposal with
some pilot work), and present the work from their term paper at the end
of the course.</p><p>
Readings and resources:</p><p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm at the Google App Engine hackathon in Ann Arbor.&nbsp; My goal for the day is to get a Django instance running on top of appengine as much as possible, using as much of the existing code base that's out there that I can.&nbsp; (This instead of say, hacking a wiki, which is what their sample app is - been there done that.)</p><p>Here's some background reading:</p><p><a href="http://www.42topics.com/dumps/django/docs.html">Using Django with Appengine</a> - Shabda Raaj.&nbsp; "Welcome to Django tutorial for integrating with Appengine. This is a port of the <a class="reference" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/">Django tutorial</a>
to use appengine instead of Pure Django.
Like in the Django tutorial, we build a poll engine, where you can
create polls and others can vote for them. Instead of the four part
Django tutorial, we use only one tutorial. Also, as many parts of
Django, most prominently its <strong>super</strong>
Admin interface do not work, we will work around them. I will assume
that you know python well. However I do not assume that you have
previous experience with Django. Django concepts are explained."</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/">app-engine-patch</a> - </p><p>With app-engine-patch a major part of Django works on App Engine
without any modifications. The most important change is that you have
to use Google's <tt>Model</tt> class because the development model is too different from Django. </p><p>We also integrate a package called <strong>ragendja</strong> which provides functions that simplify Django and App Engine development. </p><p>to be continued....</p><p>
Here's Guido van Rossum's keynote in September 2008 about Google App Engine and Django.</p>

<p>First spotted via Facebook - <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/11/13/santa-barbara-fire/">Doc Searls reports on the Santa Barbara fire</a>&nbsp;that started November 13, 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I’m listening to KNX/1070 from Los Angeles right now. “The main body of this fire is in wilderness, but there are homes below the thick black smoke… 60 mph winds… East of Mountain Drive and Cold Springs Road… the KCAL helicopter is fighting turbulence. Heavy winds.” Now they’re talking to the retired fire chief. He says the winds are high and “downcanyon” toward the ocean. “There are structures involved in this fire.” Now burning Southwest. That’s toward town. Bad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The fire apparently started near the Tea Gardens hence the name "Tea Fire"; sometimes it's seen just as "T Fire".

Over a period of about a month in the Spring of 2008, researchers at

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a Wiki Wednesday series; this post is NOT FINISHED but I needed to post it anyway.</p><p>Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same.</p><p>Here is an outline of how to explain wiki to Word users.&#0160; It is broken into three parts:&#0160; the mechanics of moving documents from Word into wiki, the process of working together on a document, and formatting the resulting work for delivery to a client. &#0160; The first part, document import, is going to vary depending on which wiki platform you are using; I&#39;ll illustrate here with <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">Socialtext</a>, which does this task in response to very specific demands from early customers.&#0160; The second piece on collaboration within wiki is fundamental to the change that people will need to internalize on how work gets done inside a wiki, and it&#39;s the hardest to experience without going hands on.&#0160; Finally, the process of moving completed works from wiki to some other presentation format is worth going through, and again the devil is in the details.</p><p><strong>What is a wiki page, and how does it differ from a Word document?</strong></p><p>A wiki page can be thought of as a single document inside a collection of related documents.&#0160; It is typically designed to have multiple authors, and it may or may not have a final published version that is delivered on paper or other static form.&#0160; In most cases, people editing the wiki page will be online while they are doing it, and their changes will be instantly reflected in the page text.</p><p>In contrast, a Word document can be thought of as a single document unconnected to any related documents.&#0160; At any time it has a single author, and there is very typically a final published version which is designed and formatted for distirbution.&#0160; In most cases, people editing a Word document will do it independent of Internet access.&#0160; Changes from multiple people are typically done sequentially, with subsequent authors able to accept or reject annotated changes in Track Changes.</p><p>Word is overwhelmingly presentation focused, and generally provides tools for people to build documents that look great.&#0160; Most wikis have much more limited user control over the aesthetics of the page, and are often designed around collaboration first and only secondarily on presentation for print.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>I have an existing draft of a document that I want to upload to a wiki to edit.&#0160; How do I do that?</strong></p><p>In most cases, you can cut and paste from any document on the Internet or any Word document directly into a wiki page.&#0160; Some formatting will be lost, and some features of the original source document (footnotes, side bars, page layout, and more) will not be preserved.</p><p>Sociatext ... document import ... ???<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>How do I track the changes in a way that I&#39;m used to within a wiki?</strong></p><p>Edit ... change ... reconcile versions.&#0160; Parallel development, merge.</p><p>Edit, edit, comment on versions.&#0160; Serial development, no merge.</p><p>Change log, history, who edited which when, what were the differences.&#0160; Diff based, not red line.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Who gets to edit this document, and how do I know that we&#39;re done?</strong></p><p>Wiki permissions, edit vs view.&#0160; Social control, expectations, soft security within an enterprise.&#0160;<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>The three people I&#39;m cooperating with have differences of opinion.&#0160; How do we reconcile these differences within a wiki?</strong></p><p>Three way document review inside Word is a huge pain to make sure you get all of the changes merged in in parallel. &#0160;You can serialize the process by having the document go round-robin but sometimes that introduces unacceptable delays.</p><p><strong>I need to take this document that we have made and make it beautiful for print (or PDF) and make it final so that the client can&#39;t make changes.&#0160; How do I do that?</strong></p><p>... is just a start; we haven&#39;t even hit footnotes, tables, immutable boilerplate, annotations in the change log, accept or reject changes, and ...&#0160; The ... is ..., and ...</p><p>-------</p><p>I wonder sometimes which portion of the population has the wiki circuitry in their brains that allow them to light it up and make sense of that environment, and which part does not and will never &quot;get it&quot;.</p>

      <p>Holiday traffic is seasonal, and we are in the post-Halloween, post-election, pre-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas season now.&#0160; Just look at the typical retail display which is already showing holiday stuff.</p><p>Based on a study of the last three year&#39;s worth of traffic to this blog, here&#39;s some things you can anticipate me writing between now and the end of November, in part because I&#39;ll write it down because I need to know it, and in part because it&#39;s just that time of the year.&#0160; A wildcard that I don&#39;t have is any long experience with a political transition, so I&#39;ll throw in something in that slot.</p><p>Food and drink - recipes suitable for Thanksgiving and the season, including vegetarian and vegan side dishes; if there&#39;s time I&#39;ll recap one year&#39;s Tofu Turkey but we probably won&#39;t make one this year.</p><p>Farmer&#39;s Market - even though the season is drawing to a close, I&#39;m still there every Saturday with Saul - we&#39;ll make sure to take good notes.&#0160; It&#39;s particularly fun to cook with the local food bloggers since they are shopping at the same place.</p><p>Michigan Football - it&#39;s getting to the end of a long dim season, and so there should be at least something to say, even if it&#39;s just construction photographs, entertaining accounts of 19c interstate border warfare, and parking price updates.</p><p>Change - change is in the air, so there&#39;s probably enough to create a new category to deal with that.&#0160; &quot;embrace change&quot; (picture of a hand grabbing a fistful of quarters).</p><p>[Category name] - Last year, the most popular page in the [category name] category was [post title], so I&#39;ll expand on that and explore [related topics].</p><p>Here&#39;s some helpful graphs to help you see when things happen in the mass consciousness, as measured by Google trends.&#0160; <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=halloween%2C+christmas%2C+thanksgiving%2C+hannukah&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">Here is Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah:</a></p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef010535ead419970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Seasons" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef010535ead419970c image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef010535ead419970c-800wi" title="Seasons" /></a>

</p><h3>boatnerd&#39;s summary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald</h3>
<p>from <a href="http://www.boatnerd.com/fitz/">http://www.boatnerd.com/fitz/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
The Fitzgerald cleared Superior, Wisconsin, on her last trip on November 9, 1975, with a cargo of 26,116 tons of taconite pellets consigned to Detroit. Traveling down Lake Superior in company with ARTHUR M. ANDERSON of the United States Steel Corporation&#39;s Great Lakes Fleet, she encountered heavy weather and in the early evening of November 10th, suddenly foundered approximately 17 miles from the entrance to Whitefish Bay (47º North Latitude, 85º 7&#39; West Longitude)
</p></blockquote>
<h3>The storm that sunk the Fitz</h3>
<p> from Steve Ackerman and John Knox at <a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/fitz.html">U of Wisconsin Meteorology</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
On November 9 at 7 p.m. the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a gale warning for Lake Superior. In a gale, the wind speeds range from 34-40 knots. The NWS predicted east to northeasterly winds during the night, shifting to NW to N by the afternoon of November 10. At approximately 10:40 p.m. the NWS revised its forecast for eastern Lake Superior to easterly winds becoming southeasterly the morning of the 10th. At about 2:00 am November 10 the NWS upgraded the gale warning to a storm warning (winds 48-55 knots) with a prediction of &quot;northeast winds 35 to 50 knots becoming northwesterly 28 to 38 knots on Monday, waves 8 to 15 feet&quot;. Around 2 a.m. the Captains of the Anderson and Fitzgerald discussed the threatening weather and decided to change their route. This safer route would take them northward, toward the coast of Canada. The northern route would protect them from the waves that the storm generated.

which land does well for its inhabitants, citizens do well by their
land, and both end up better by reason of partnership. Aldo Leopold
recognized that no matter how sophisticated we become, people will
always depend on the land—“the land” being shorthand for the community
that not only includes and values people but also plants, animals,
soils, and waters, from the highest strata of the atmosphere to the
depths of the ocean. We often take natural resources and ecosystems for
granted, but, ultimately, the planet’s natural communities and natural
functions are what sustain our economy and enrich our lives. “That land
is a community,” Leopold wrote, “is the basic concept of ecology, but
that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics.” </p><p class="padding">Aldo is the grandfather of Scott and Todd Leopold, who ran the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Leopold_Bros">Leopold Bros</a> brewpub and distillery from a converted brake factory on Main Street in Ann Arbor.&#0160; <a href="http://homelessdave.com/tt20060906toddleopold.htm">(Here&#39;s an interview of Todd Leopold on Teeter Talk.)</a> <a href="http://www.leopoldbros.com/Leopold_Bros./Welcome.html">Scott and Todd have relocated to Colorado, where they have focused on their small batch, hand distilled spirits.</a></p>

 Since it&#39;s game day (Michigan at Minnesota) I thought I&#39;d link to at least a few connections between Michigan and Minnesota.</p><p>1.&#0160; The Little Brown Jug is the trophy that goes back and forth between the two schools depending on which one wins the game.&#0160; It was originally purchased as a water jug for the Michigan team on an away game to Minnesota in 1903, it was left behind after the game (a 6-6 tie).&#0160; <a href="http://www.thedailygopher.com/2008/11/6/655570/the-little-brown-jug">The Daily Gopher has an excellent roundup of the story (warning: Minnesota point of view) quoting from several Michigan football blogs.</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Days later when Yost sent a letter requesting his water jug back, Cook replied saying &quot;<em>We have your little brown jug; if you want it, you’ll have to win it.</em>&quot; <br /></div><p><br />More on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Little_Brown_Jug">Little Brown Jug</a>, and on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Brown_Jug">Brown Jug</a> (a South University campus bar and restaurant) at Arborwiki.</p><p>2.&#0160; Michigan shares a border with Minnesota along Lake Superior, and there is public transportation by ferry from Houghton, Michigan to Grand Portage, Minnesota via a stop at the Isle Royale National Park.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://www.isleroyaleboats.com/">Minnesota to Isle Royale ferry information:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Grand Portage Isle Royale Transportation Line began as a way for the
	Sivertson family of Lake Superior&#39;s north shore to transport their catch of
	freshwater fish from Isle Royale to Minnesota. It gradually expanded to include
	passenger service. <br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.nps.gov/isro">Michigan to Isle Royale ferry information:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Unlike other Isle Royale ferry services, the Ranger III was designed by
the National Park Service specifically to bridge the gap between the
mainland and the Island. It was built to withstand the Lake’s fierce
storms and its ice breaking capabilities assist in opening the park in
the spring. An experienced nine-member crew take great pride in not
only maintaining the vessel, but in serving its passengers. The Ranger
III’s Captain, Bill Hanrahan, a graduate of the Great Lakes Maritime
Academy, has over&#0160;30 years of experience; the crews combined experience
is just under 200 years.</div><p><br />3.&#0160; Ann Arbor, MI was the site of GopherCon &#39;92, a 50 person workshop for developers and users of the Gopher information system, a pioneering Internet publishing system that was for some brief furry moment the hot new thing on MTV and bigger than that super-complicated World Wide Web hypertext thing.&#0160; <a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt">Prentiss Riddle wrote up the trip report for it,</a> and here&#39;s his writeup on my presentation at the time:</p><blockquote><p>RELATED TECHNOLOGIES: Ed Vielmetti of CICnet gave a talk on &quot;what we would be gathering to discuss if UMinn had never developed Gopher&quot;, meaning primarily World-Wide Web (WWW). WWW was developed for the high-energy physics community and serves as a model of what Gopher could do if a discipline-oriented virtual community invested in it<br />heavily. WWW is based on SGML (Standard General Markup Language&quot;), an ISO standard for marking up text which WWW uses to implement hypertext. SGML is a bear and it is a significant investment of effort to properly add a document to WWW, but the result is quite powerful (for instance, WWW handles footnotes in hypertext). </p></blockquote>
<p>The Internet periodically notices that Gopher is not dead; here are a survey of the current Gopher infrastructure from <a href="http://kottke.org/06/08/gopher-still-going">Jason Kottke</a>, some April development from <a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/geekery/howto_make_a_weblog_a_gopherlog.php">George Hotelling</a>, and a manifesto from <a href="http://www.scn.org/%7Ebkarger/gopher-manifesto">Bjorn Karger</a>.&#0160; </p>

<p>Along with all of the other t-shirts (Michigan Beer Pong, Michigan Undecided) for sale on State Street before football games, a new one has appeared this year:&nbsp; "2008 Worst Season Ever".</p><p>Not being one to quarrel with a t-shirt, I thought I'd go back through history and see just how bad this year's team is compared to teams of the past.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Rich Rodriguez has the worst lifetime record (2-7) of any Michigan football coach.&nbsp; The nearest benchmark is the 1891 team, coached by Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford, who coached for one season with a 4-5 mark.&nbsp; </p><p>2.&nbsp; The last years in modern times to have a two win season are 1962 (Bump Elliot) and 1958 (Bennie Oosterbann's last year).&nbsp; </p><p>3.&nbsp; In <a href="http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1934fbt.htm">1934</a> and <a href="http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1936fbt.htm">1936</a>, Harry Kipke coached to a 1-7 record.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2007/11/harry-kipke-has-street-named-after-him.html">Harry Kipke has a street named after him</a>, notes the Hoover Street Rag, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1572436611/ref=sib_fs_top?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S00P&amp;checkSum=GoXlC%2BSVJfrhGaPTmGnsh3HniGYNsTaS19keqemvgqE%3D#reader-link">the late Gerald Ford was MVP of the 1934 team.&nbsp; </a>   Ford wrote a chapter in What It Means To Be A Wolverine which is worth a read about just how difficult a year that was.</p>
<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=superpatron-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=1572436611&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>So, not quite the worst season ever, but pretty close - "worst coach ever" is too soon to tell, but RichRod still needs to live up to the Bump Elliot benchmark of winning the Rose Bowl (with the 1964 team vs Oregon State).</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/michigan-footba.html">The other football benchmark is of course is Michigan football (see the season map):</a> look for a report on how the season compares to previous years next week.&nbsp; The reports I have gathered from people with parking near the stadium who always fill up is that prices don't vary much by the success of the team, but the time to sell out the lot is a lot less on a busy day.&nbsp; As you get farther from the Big House, even lower prices won't necessarily fill all the spaces.  Ann Arbor taxpayers depend on the rents from their 7x/year lawns to pay the property taxes, so we're all pulling for the team. </p>

      <p>There was a brief interlude after Halloween to allow for Election Season, but then all of the orange-themed holiday items were swept away from the stores and are now replaced by green and red themed holiday items.&#0160; (New packaging, same stuff.)&#0160; That was what it looked like both at Kroger and at Caribou Coffee yesterday, quite disconcerting to go with the 60+ degree weather.</p>
<p>Kroger had a large clock up in view of the checkout lanes with a countdown timer until Christmas, something like this one (except a lot cheaper).</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fan of countdown timers as a personal management tool; set a widget to beep after 15 minutes and do one thing until then.&#0160; <a href="http://www.baldgeeks.com/3-2-1.htm">(I&#39;m using the 3-2-1 timer from BaldGeeks on my Mac.)</a> It helps, for instance, to make sure that you don&#39;t miss the bus for a meeting, and it helps to make sure that the kids know just how long they can stay in bed before school starts. But the xmasy themed technology goes a little too far.&#0160; (Besides, I&#39;m counting the days until Groundhog Day, and there is no market for marmot-themed plastic.)</p>

</p><p><strong>1.&#0160; Design for infinite traffic.</strong></p><p>Election reporting is perhaps the best reason to look at cloud computing as a system for dealing with peak load needs.&#0160; Demand for election information is very intense for a few hours, and then goes away.&#0160; Any system that you build that involves a stack of your own equipment sitting in some machine room is going to be too big for most of the time, and then too small when you need it most.</p><p>As an example, the fancy maps from <a href="http://twittervotereport.com">Twitter Vote Report</a> were down mid-day, but came back up when they reconfigured the site.&#0160; </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://twitter.com/votereport/status/990021531">RT networkredux &quot;@votereport increase to 8 3.0Ghz cores on the primary web VM seemed to steady things a bit.&quot;</a></p>
<p>
As another example, Nate Silver&#39;s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> is hosted on Google&#39;s Blogger platform.&#0160; How many cores did that site run on?&#0160; As many as Google had available for the task.&#0160; And when push came to shove, <a href="http://www.contentious.com/2008/11/04/fivethirtyeightcom-runs-on-blogger-wha/">Blogger wasn&#39;t up to the task at the heat of the moment either.</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re here and trying to publish, just can&#39;t.&#0160; They can&#39;t handle the traffic.&#0160; Sorry everybody.<br /><br /></div><p>Election night is an enormously busy night; if there was ever a time to design for one day of traffic, this is it.&#0160; I&#39;m not sure how you can budget for infinite demand.</p>
<p><strong>2.&#0160; In 2008, every page is about the elections.</strong></p><p>Whether it&#39;s internet advertising, campaign coverage, partisan bickering, technology development, or just reporting on what&#39;s going on around town, it seems like every page on the whole Internet was about the elections.&#0160; It reminded me eerily of 1999, when every page was about the Year 2000, and a legion of programmers was employed fixing things; will the end of the 2008 campaign ad spend (<a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3631249">projected at $17 million online</a>) lead to the end of the web 2.0 era?</p><p><strong>3.&#0160; Sending &quot;I voted&quot; to your network gets your network to vote.</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t know this for sure; it&#39;s hard to tell from anecdotal reports, but my sense is that people who are using systems like Facebook and Twitter which make it easy to report that they voted are more likely to get their friends to vote.&#0160; </p><p>Facebook in particular made this easy with the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/about">Causes</a> application that let you &quot;donate your status message&quot; in advance to pre-scheduled reminders to your friends to vote.&#0160; <a href="http://www.insidefacebook.com/2008/11/04/facebook-causes-helping-to-get-out-the-vote-on-election-day/">This get out the vote effort was given front page status with a rolling ticker on election day.</a>&#0160; Causes recorded <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/election?m=bd6ad275&amp;_fb_fromhash=a55921e67257c4c26608ca3f1d13fe3c">1.7 million voters, who voted 70% to 21% for Obama,</a> and now they know at least as much as any exit poll ever did.</p><p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/marketing-lesso.html">Seth Godin writes more on this topic.</a></p><p><strong>4.&#0160; There are problems with voting systems everywhere.</strong></p><p>The sad conclusion of watching Twitter and #votereport for a few hours makes it clear that as voting turnout increases, the chances for things to go wrong go up.&#0160; Whether it&#39;s inadequate support at polling places leading to long lines, bad line control putting people in the wrong line to vote, or problems with ballots or machines, it&#39;s easy to find people who ran into snags and snafus.</p><p><a href="http://highearthorbit.com/amazing-vote-reports/">Andrew Turner posts a recap of the amazing vote reports that the #votereport project gathered</a> - both good stories and bad about how things worked.&#0160; There&#39;s a lot more to learn from that project and they have an awesome dataset to look at for review of where things went wrong (and where they went right). </p><p><strong>5.&#0160; Practice makes perfect.</strong></p><p>I voted using the Accumark system.&#0160; It was mostly painless, helped in large part by having done it enough times that I knew what was likely to fail.&#0160; The poll worker there knew that I needed to tear off the strip on top of the ballot before feeding it into the marking machine - the simple solution to most of the reported problems with the device - in part because this was my third time through this same precinct with the same voting machine and we figured it out before.</p><p><strong>6.&#0160; (something about polls)</strong></p><p>Nate Silver at <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight.com</a> is still going over the differences between poll data and actual vote counts, but it&#39;s clear: there&#39;s a widespread, systematic, and unpredictable difference between what people say they are going to do to pollsters and what they actually do in the voting booth.&#0160;&#0160; FiveThirtyEight did an amazing job at correcting for systematic poll bias, but even with all that there were still a few surprises (Indiana?!?) where you just couldn&#39;t know.</p><p><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/research/unpublished/electionnight.pdf">A paper by Andrew Gelman and Nate Silver circulated in the afternoon of election day,</a> on statistics and conditional probabilities, predicting Obama 99% if he wins Virginia based on scenario analysis.</p><p><strong>7.&#0160; Prepare ahead of time</strong></p><p>My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/michigan-2008-election-results.html">Michigan Election Results</a> page this year was easy to write because I had written the same page in previous elections, knew where the results would be, and knew crucially which search terms people would be using.&#0160; I made it relevant before results came in by posting where the election parties would be.&#0160; You know these things are going to happen because they happened before; there&#39;s no reason to need to scramble at the last minute to put something together.</p><p>---<br />Lessons learned from previous events, for better or worse:</p><p>Hurricane season - <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/gustav-social-m.html">Gustav lessons learned</a><br />Disaster relief and reporting - the process of the <a href="http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA368651">&quot;after action review&quot;</a> as derived from US Army practice<br /><a href="http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2005/10/today_i_publicl.html">Aviation safety compared to computer security</a></p>

      </h3>
      This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly
part of the same easy to define train of thought.  It's
"note to self", or "note to future self", for the sorts of things
that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again.
It's notes about places I'd aspire to be and events I'd like to go
to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get
interested enough in something to write down what I find out about
it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that
find it (and more) so I can learn more.

The result was described by someone as "it looks like part of a
bigger project, but I don't know what it is".

Let me describe the bigger project in words that I used in 1998
when I launched some earlier version of this project as the Vacuum
mailing list:

> How can people organize in their minds and personal interactions
information about a network so large that strains the limits of the
imagination? Vacuum tries to provide insight, tools, and clues to find
out.

That was 1998, about 10 years ago - the net was a lot smaller
then. I marvel at its complexity now.&nbsp; But for the most
part I don't try to do anything other than help answer this continuing
question.

I'm trying to take <a
href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret">a systematic approach
to self-instruction at my new blog called The Bloggers's Secret</a>,
but as always understanding what you already know in a format that
lets you tell others about it is a continuous work.</p><p>--</p><p>More

      </h3>
      <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the <a href="http://delicious.com/tag/polenta">delicious tag polenta</a>, from the blog <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/">Hungry Cravings</a> - the so called <a href="http://hungrycravings.blogspot.com/2008/10/cheater-method.html">Cheater Method Polenta</a>.</p><p>The critics were skeptical:</p><div class="msg">

Possible, but unlikely. Good luck!<br /><br />but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that.<br /></span>
 </div><br /><p><br /><strong>Baked Polenta</strong><br />adapted from a recipe by Lucy Vaserfirer. </p><p>1 cup polenta<br />4 cups boiling water<br />salt<br />pepper</p><p>preheat oven to 425 degrees.<br />pour polenta into an 8x8 baking pan.<br />pour boiling water on top, stir.<br />season with salt and pepper.<br />put in the oven to cook.<br />stir a couple of times, take it out when it&#39;s done, about 40 minutes.</p><p>You end up with something delicious - it&#39;s not creamy like well-stirred polenta, but it comes out of the pan in lovely squares ready for sauce.&#0160; If anything it&#39;s more like a one-step recipe for baked leftover polenta. Serve with a sauce on top.</p><p>The original recipe has more spices (hot pepper flakes) and more substance (cheese, pepperoni), but I thought I&#39;d bring it back to basics for the start.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-fire.html">The City of Ann Arbor has started an email-based delivery service for changes and updates to the city&#39;s web site run by GovDelivery.</a>&#0160; I contacted Dave Sommerness, a University of Michigan graduate and their COO, to find out more.</p><p><strong>
How did your organization get started, and who was your first customer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govdelivery.com">GovDelivery</a>, Inc. was started in 1999 by our two co-founders, CEO Scott Burns and EVP of Sales Zach Stabenow. &#0160;We developed the GovDelivery Digital Subscription Management system in 2000 in collaboration with the City of St. Paul, who had a need for reliable communication with its residents. &#0160;We found this need to be pervasive across public sector organizations, and it&#39;s taken off quite well from there.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Government web sites are built with all kinds of technologies. &#0160;How do you manage the process so that it all looks the same to the user?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We integrate with client sites by simple links on their web pages. &#0160;The effect is seamless because we customize our web and email templates to match the look-and-feel of each client. &#0160;Behind the scenes GovDelivery is deployed as a multi-tenant, SaaS system, so Ann Arbor is using the same basic application as our other clients.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
The service I signed up for was an email based one. &#0160;What are your plans for looking at web 2.0 technologies for notification, e.g. using something like Twitter to do messaging?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We&#39;re always looking forward to new technologies and applications to our system/market. &#0160;A couple years ago we added RSS capability, so our clients can publish their messages as RSS feeds in addition to sending them out through email. &#0160;We&#39;ve seen a lot of excitement in our market over Web 2.0 technologies, so we&#39;re developing functionality to take advantage of that and promote more options for communication and collaboration between government and citizens. &#0160;A few examples of Web<br />
2.0 notification that we already support include automatically posting messages to blogs, updating a Facebook page, and using public RSS feeds to publish bulletins to widgets.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Do you work with libraries as part of your business, and if so, can you share some good stories from those implementations?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>The majority of our experience has been with government bodies - from small cities and counties up to the largest federal departments - and transit authorities, though we have some experience with education,<br />
non-profits, and other organizations. &#0160;We work with a number of libraries, mainly through city accounts, but the most notable stand-alone library account is the Library of Congress.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
What makes St. Paul a good place to run this business from, and not Silicon Valley or Washington, DC?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>Good business is about good people, and there&#39;s a great pool of talent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. We&#39;re one of the fastest growing software companies in the area, which attracts talented people and helps us to retain and keep them challenged. &#0160;We don&#39;t have the issues that Silicon Valley has where folks are more apt to jump to the next flavor of the day. &#0160;Because of the density of clients in D.C., we do maintain a sales office and staff there, which we plan to grow as the business does.</p><p><strong>
Who do you root for when Michigan plays Minnesota?</strong></p><p>I grew up a Bulldog hockey fan in Duluth - the Gophers were big rivals, so it&#39;s been tough for me to become a fan of any of their teams. &#0160;The real dilemma for me would be if Michigan ever played UMD in hockey.</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks Dave!</p>

<strong>Venue:</strong> The Michigan League, University of Michigan<strong><br /><br /></strong>Here&#39;s a big additional amount of description of the event, from their web site:</p><div class="content">
   <h3>Conference Overview</h3>
   <p>A
conference of invited presentations is to be held in Ann Arbor on
November 7-9 2008 to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Language
Learning and to explore a paradigm shift currently taking place across
the language sciences, the growing realization of Language as a Complex
Adaptive System.</p>
   <p> Language Learning was first
published from the University of Michigan in 1948. Its subtitle then
was &quot;A Quarterly Journal of Applied Linguistics&quot;; indeed the beginnings
of &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; have been attributed to this usage. In the 60
years since, the subtitle has evolved to become &quot;A Journal of Research
in Language Studies&quot; reflecting our mission: </p><blockquote><p>Language Learning is a scientific journal
dedicated to the understanding of language learning broadly defined. It
publishes research articles that systematically apply methods of
inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive
science, educational inquiry, neuroscience, ethnography,
sociolinguistics, sociology, and semiotics. It is concerned with
fundamental theoretical issues in language learning such as child,
second, and foreign language acquisition, language education,
bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain,
culture, cognition, pragmatics, and intergroup relations.</p></blockquote>
   
   <p>The
conference in 2008 will mark our 60th anniversary and our remarkable
success towards these ends. Members of the board, past editors, our
colleagues at Wiley-Blackwell, and friends and confederates in this
enterprise are gathering to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The topic of
the conference is Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent
research across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, and changes over time. However, there is mounting
evidence that processes of language acquisition, use, and change are
not independent from one another but are facets of the same complex
adaptive system. This theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues
from different branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems
(including Clay Beckner, Richard Blythe, Joan Bybee, Morten H.
Christiansen, William Croft, Nick C. Ellis, John Holland, Jinyun Ke,
Diane Larsen-Freeman, and Tom Schoenemann) at a meeting at the Santa Fe
Institute in 2007. &quot;The Five Graces Group&quot; (named after their rather
special accommodations there) are offering a position paper on Language
as a Complex Adaptive System as the introductory piece for the
conference followed by ten individual papers that discuss substantive
areas of language from this perspective. The authors of these ten
papers are active in their recognition of complexity in their
respective areas, ranging from language usage, structure and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing. Discussion of these
papers will be led by members of the board of Language Learning in
order to contextualize these influences within Applied Linguistics and
the Language Sciences more generally.</p>
   <p>Written papers
based on these presentations will form a special issue of the journal
Language Learning (2009, Volume 59, Supplement 1). The proceedings will
also be recorded and later made available through Wiley-Blackwell and
the University of Michigan as a webcast.</p><p>The previous day there&#39;s a seminar on campus:</p><h3><font color="red">Emergence in Physical, Biological, and Social Systems III</font></h3>
<h3>November 7, 2008</h3>
<h3>340 West Hall, University of Michigan</h3>
<h3>9 am-4:30 pm</h3>

<h3>Talks and Poster Session open to the public</h3>
<br />
<p>
Our goal is to help
encourage the formation of a coherent community of researchers on
campus grouped around
the general theme of complexity, emergence, and collective effects.
This third ICAM meeting at the University of Michigan is timed to
connect to the University of Michigan conference on <a href="http://elicorpora.info/LLC/overview">&quot;Language as a Complex Adaptive System&quot;</a> (Nov.8-9, 2008)</p>
<p>
The meeting is intended for an audience with a wide range of backgrounds.</p>

      <p>(from the ICOS mailing list)</p><p>Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common<br />
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.</p><p><a href="http://icos.cms.si.umich.edu/sites/icos.cms.si.umich.edu/files/Espeland.pdf">The Discipline of Rankings:

<br /><a href="http://www.sociology.northwestern.edu/faculty/espeland/home.html">Wendy Espeland 
Northwestern University </a></p><p>This article demonstrates the value of Foucault‟s conception of discipline for understanding organizational responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault‟s 
depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings 
change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This 
approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the 
prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the 
external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to 
buffer or hide some activities. Members‟ tendency to internalize these pressures, to 
become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that 
rankings produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and 
by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of 
performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional 
environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a 
crucial task for scholars.

      <p><a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com/2008/10/7-random-food-facts.html">Inspired by Kate from Four Obsessions, here are seven food-related things to share.</a></p><p>1.&#0160;&#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&#0160; If you&#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&#39;ll understand.&#0160; Locally this means that the first day of <a href="http://google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+blueberries">blueberry</a>, raspberry, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/juneberry/">juneberry</a>, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</p><p>2.&#0160; When I was a kid we made cookies out of acorns once.&#0160; It took a long time to gather them, and a lot of work to process them, and when they finally got into the oven somehow (mysteriously) they got scorched.&#0160; I&#39;ve never had the need to repeat that experience.</p><p>3.&#0160; The first complicated recipe I tried was <a href="http://amasci.com/amateur/sciamdx.html">sauce Bearnaise, using a recipe from Scientific American&#39;s The Amateur Scientist (1979 Dec, pg 178; 1981 Jan, pg 164).&#0160;</a>&#0160; It turned out pretty well.</p><p>4.&#0160; After having had <a href="http://williamtozier.com/slurry/2008/09/16/winter-squash-caramel">sweet dumpling squash</a>, I can&#39;t go back to ever eating acorn squash again.</p><p>5.&#0160; We are vegetarians at home, but I&#39;m a confirmed omnivore, and so you&#39;ll see restaurant reviews of meat dishes but only vegetarian recipes.</p><p>6.&#0160; I&#39;m bad at doing recipes because I hardly ever measure anything anymore - mostly I spice things by eye and smell, and as often as not the recipes I end up with are a description of what I did this one time with the food on hand and not instructions for what to go buy.&#0160;&#0160; I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some recipe vocabulary in some language that I&#39;m missing which could make them better, other than &quot;cook until it smells good&quot;.</p><p>7.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken to blogging recipes in part because it&#39;s a convenient way to look them up the next time I need to cook them, since I don&#39;t always know which cookbook on our shelf has the recipe on the menu plan for the week. </p><p>Tag: <a href="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/10/jimmy-wales-gro.html">Jim Benson (e.g. &quot;stir-fried wikipedia with pimentoes&quot;)</a>, <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com/2008/02/paczki-day-tomo.html">KitchenChick (my reliable source for Paczki Day information)</a>, and The Cottage Smallholder (who <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=855">got tagged already</a>)</p>
