<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>I'm on vacation for a week up north, but news still hits my inbox. Here's a very brief take on some things that I have learned while I've been gone that deserve to be dumped out into the internet so that our fine intelligence agencies have something more to chew on.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Damn Arbor editor Ben Connor Barrie has <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/08/coming-clean.html">moved to Ypsilanti</a>, prompting Mark Maynard to run an <a href="http://markmaynard.com/2013/08/ypsilanti-immigration-interview-erika-jost-and-ben-connor-barrie/">immigration interview</a>.</p></li>

      </h3>
      <p>On August 15 2013, Cisco announced that it would be laying off 5% of its workforce, or about 4000 employees. Some details:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1236468">Cisco Q4 2013 earnings report</a> does not mention layoffs</li>

</ul>

<p>"Because we need to continue to accelerate how we capture growth opportunities, we are taking a series of actions such as reducing management layers, prioritizing R&amp;D investments and a workforce reduction affecting about 4,000 employees, or 5 percent of our workforce."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23862152/cisco-systems-reports-increased-sales-and-profit">Mercury News</a> has a history of Cisco layoffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 4,000 job cuts that Cisco Systems announced Wednesday are the latest in several major staff reductions by the San Jose networking company. Others include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>July 2012: 1,300 jobs, about 2 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>July 2011: 6,500 jobs, 4,400 through layoffs and 2,100 through early retirement packages, representing 9 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>February 2009: 2,000 jobs out of a workforce of 66,560</li>
  <li>April 2001: 8,500 jobs, including 6,000 full-time employees and 2,500 contractors</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more than 5,000 members on LinkedIn of the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=832&amp;mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah">Cisco Alumni Association</a>; if you are laid off in this round or if you had previously left Cisco, you are welcome to join.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ten years ago, the power went out.</p>

<p>It's not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it's just you or if it's happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called <a href="http://forkestra.com/">Dave Langhorst</a>, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/power_outage.html">2003 blackout</a> here on Vacuum, and the day after, I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/network_down_re.html">asked if people had good fiction</a> to share about end-of-the-world scenarios that involved not fire or ice but network downtime. E. M. Forster's <a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a> was the universal recommendation; I recommend it to you as well as a short story from more than 100 years ago about the death of the net as we know it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a feeling that I'm going to be doing a lot more writing using the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown
is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/using_markdown.html">supported by Typepad</a>, <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">supported by Octopress</a> (with a bunch of enhancements), <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">supported by Github</a> (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), <a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">supported by Vim</a> (with colorizing of text),
and <a href="https://leanpub.com/help/manual">supported by Leanpub</a> (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files). That's five
for five for the environments I'm working in the most, which suggests that it's
worthwhile to learn all that I can.</p>

<p>Markdown is a fairly simple language, and it's relatively old in net terms (2004)
so it's had time to mature. Maturing means both that there are well-documented
core features that are invariant among all Markdown interpreters, as well as 
sometimes incompatible details that show up when people extend the system.</p>

<p>Some popular interpreters include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/">Discount</a>, in C</li>
<li><a href="http://dafoster.net/projects/rdiscount/">RDiscount</a>, in Ruby as a wrapper to Discount</li>
<li><a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">kramdown</a>, written in Ruby</li>
<li><a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/">Maruku</a>, also written in Ruby; can render to LaTeX</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">Redcarpet</a>, a Ruby gem</li>
</ul>

<p>And some popular editors for Mac OS X include:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>, a Markdown editor for web developers</li></p>

<p>You'll find <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/35-markdown-apps-for-the-mac/">reviews of 35 Markdown apps for Mac</a> at Appstorm; I haven't tried them all (and probably never will).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Setting up <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has given me a chance to look through some of
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti">my old Github repositories</a> and re-assess what's there and how to 
improve on them. </p>

<p>This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it
reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a
github account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/aadl-amazon-linky">aadl-amazon-linky</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">superpatron</a>. Both of these are interfaces
to the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> catalog, which has a very accessible
programming interface with things like RSS feeds for catalog searches.
I'd like to go back and revisit two parts of this. One was a Greasemonkey
plugin to put library results in Amazon; that should be a Chrome plugin.
The second was a "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/79567788/">wall of books</a>" report displaying an RSS query as a
page full of book cover images. Of the two, the second looks easiest to
recreate; I just checked in some new code, <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/superpatron/blob/master/tools/wall-by-keyword.sh">wall by keyword</a>, which does
the trick.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools">vielmetti-shelltools</a>. This is a small collection of shell scripts
that I carry around with me and put on whatever system I happen to be
working on. It would be worthwhile to go back through and compare
what I used then with what I use now and refresh the collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">postcard</a>. This was a hopeful project to use various web-to-postcard
APIs to generate custom postcards on the fly from the command line. Alas,
several of those APIs have disappeared. The real action in this market is
sending a real postcard from your iPhone or Android phone, with products
like <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a> leading the way. The other neat feature is to go to a drugstore
and make an instant print, then stick a stamp on the back and mail it.
(<a href="http://communitynetworking2008.wordpress.com/">Steve Cisler</a> taught me that trick.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter-mutual-friends</a>. Once upon a time, the Twitter API was so
simple that you could write a useful application in four lines of shell
script. Now the API has improved itself, and it's gotten a lot more 
complicated. Look at simple apps like <a href="https://github.com/gianu/latest_tweets">latest_tweets</a> by gianu to
get an idea of what you're up against now.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">mobile</a>. Again, once upon a time, I had a Blackberry phone which
had the world's worst usable web browser. Fortunately there were enough
web sites that had a minimalist presentation that I was able to put
together a directory of workable sites, which I used for quite a while.
Now I have an Android phone that runs Chrome as well as apps and I don't
need the list of sites quite so much; still, it's worthwhile to have
a place to collect them when I find them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So when it's time to write some code here are some ideas for where
to start again!</p>

      <p>A friend of mine was in a motorcycle accident in Ypsilanti on Friday, August 9, 2013.

An early 1990&#39;s, I believe a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corsica" target="_self">Chevrolet Corsica</a>, tan/gold in color, made an illegal right turn from the far left lane in front of our motorcycle. The vehicle stopped briefly in the intersection after causing us to dump our bike, but quickly left after the Ypsi Fire Dept came on the scene. </p>
<p>I know that the first two pedestrians who spoke with us witnessed the accident, and appeared to be taking pictures/video of the scene. A third pedestrian, wearing a pink t-shirt, helped get our bike off of us and handed me my partners glasses. I&#39;m sure he also witnessed the incident, and saw the vehicle leave the scene. </p>
<p>If you, or anyone you&#39;ve spoke to had told you about this accident, or have pics/video if the incident, please contact me through this post. It can be done anonymously, we are looking for the driver of the vehicle who left the scene. Also, I&#39;d like to thank the pedestrians, Ypsi firefighters, the fine paramedics of HVA, and Officer Thompson of Ypsi PD for all your help.

      <p>I am using Octopress to build a new web site at <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io">http://vielmetti.github.io</a>. This looks like it will be a good place as any to write about code and any github projects I am working on. I will keep writing about everything else here.</p>

<p>To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown. Then you use a command line tool called 'rake', the Ruby version of 'make', to do the publishing. Files that have changed get checked in to github. Then the whole site is put into static files, so that it all loads fast.</p>

<p>Amazing how much more time you have for hacking when you are not on Facebook.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Several reasons why I am removing the Facebook from my phone.</p>

<p>Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</p>

<p>Facebook's ads are increasingly intrusive. It is easier to cope with the ads on Twitter.</p>

<p>It is easy to switch identity on the Twitter client so if I temporarily need to take the voice of Arborwiki or of Heikki Lunta it is easy. With Facebook I am expected to be me all the time.</p>

<p>The mobile Android Facebook client is bad at reminders of birthdays, so to do that I need to go to the desktop client anyways.</p>

<p>Time on Facebook generally is time away from blogging. True, the blog has fewer readers and less comments then an equal post on Facebook, but I am not writing this strictly to chase feedback.</p>

<p>It is always worthwhile to experiment with change, especially since it would be easy to change back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997">from the Ann Arbor District Library.</a></p>

<p>Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</p>

<p>Grant likes givers, but recognizes that sometimes people give too much and never manage to get things in return. These selfless people tend to burn out when too many things go opposite to their interests. He opens up the opportunity to recognize a newly coined word "otherish" - an opposite of selfish where you consider both your interests and the others interests simultaneously. "Otherish" people are looking for win-win situations, as opposed to selfless people who end up in win-lose setups.</p>

<p>"Givers are overrepresented at the top, as well as at the bottom, of most success measures." </p>

<p>An <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/printer_friendly.cfm?articleid=3224">interview with Adam Grant</a> about the book is a 25 minute version which touches on several more high points of the book.</p>

      <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. That candidate who will go unnamed was said to have been very upset about losing, and their supporters were said to have been rude to the press and to other politicos present. I wasn't there to witness it myself.</p>

Here&#39;s a few notes. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/ann-arbor-planning-commission-denies-rezoning-for-duplex-on-packard/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story about the meeting</a> and a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/08/07/rezoning-request-denied-for-3325-packard/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes. By a unanimous vote, the Planning Commission turned down the request, stating in the discussion both that the master plan envisioned single-family homes in that area and that they were not in the habit of doing &quot;spot zoning&quot; to change a single parcel. The petitioner was encouraged to consult with neighbors to see if an entire block front could be upzoned which would be more likely - though by no means guaranteed - to get approval.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of public commentary on this public hearing came from a neighbor, who did not express an opinion about the zoning request but did request that the property owners trim their trees, which are extending over to her roof.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that has duplexes, and I have to say that they are perfectly in character in a mix of housing that includes single-family houses next door. Indeed, I can&#39;t imagine a neighborhood situation where a duplex would be out of character anywhere in Ann Arbor, especially given modern duplex designs that look like single-family homes. It&#39;s not atypical that on my block a neighbor lives in a home that was built as a single family home, was duplexed in the 1940s, and was unduplexed when she bought it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not sure that the master planning for the area in question makes any sense. Packard is an extraordinary busy street near Platt, and five lanes of traffic means that any single family home is going to be particularly attractive to a buyer. The part of Packard that I leave near is upzoned along quite a length, allowing for a mix of rental properties, small apartment buildings, offices and retail. It&#39;s a good mix, and makes for a more interesting place to live. I&#39;d think that even if the area in question stayed residential that it would be sensible to allow more density along Packard - not necessarily a 13 story high rise, but other dense residential or small-scale commerical or office property that characterizes the rest of the Packard corridor.</p>
<p>The zoning map below shows the parcel - it&#39;s one of the ten residential lots on the north size of Packard, with commerical and apartment buildings across the street and offices and retail on the same side to the west.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>PRESS RELEASE<br />For Immediate Release&#0160;<br />CONTACT: Karen Levin, Chair, Dog Park Subcommittee of the Park Advisory Commission,&#0160;734.645.8904<br /><br />PARK ADVISORY COMMISSION SEEKS PUBLIC INPUT ON POTENTIAL DOG PARK LOCATIONS<br /><br />ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 29, 2013 — The City’s Dog Park Subcommittee of the Park Advisory Commission (PAC) is inviting the public to participate in an online survey to gather feedback and opinions on potential dog park locations and features. The survey,&#0160;<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/s/7YXPKXG</a>, is brief and should take about 10 minutes to fill out. Everyone is invited to take this survey, dog owners and non owners, alike. Input on the survey is very important to PAC and will help create recommendations that improve overall parks and recreation service to the residents of Ann Arbor. The survey remains open through Monday, Aug. 12, 2013.<br /><br />The desire for additional dog parks is identified in the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Open Space Plan (an element of the City Master Plan). In an effort to ensure PAC is responding to this need in an appropriate manner, the public is being asked for input on where one or more dog parks could be located and what types of amenities should be considered for inclusion in new and existing dog parks.<br /><br />While there is not a single standard for dog park development, the subcommittee has been working to identify best practices from around the country to develop elements and criteria that we believe will lead to successful dog parks in Ann Arbor. Some of these elements/criteria include location, size, and the features on site. However, the committee knows there may be others, so a key objective of this survey is to understand what additional criteria the public believes is important to successful dog parks.<br /><br />The Dog Park Subcommittee will also host two public meetings — Tuesday, Aug. 27 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in the basement conference room of Larcom City Hall (301 E. Huron Street), and Wednesday, Sept. 11 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Cobblestone Farm Barn (2781 Packard Road) — to share the survey results and further engage the community on this important topic. You can also email your input to: a2parks@a2gov.org.

      <p>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most <a href="http://mediagazer.com/#a130805p20" target="_self">complete collection of links</a> about the Bezos transaction.</p>
<p>Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print. Everyone will be watching the Post&#39;s digital operations to see how it changes over time to incorporate the things that Bezos learned from tipping the book world upside down with the Kindle.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><strong><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_self">TOR</a></strong> is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &quot;onion routers&quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &quot;dark&quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet. A 2005 era web site <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/" target="_self">describes the theory</a> behind onion routing.</p>
<p>The TOR network operators have encouraged a broad spectrum of users to participate in the system, and it has become favored of several unsavory business enterprises that take advantage of the anonymity provided to transact business that would be shut down on the public Internet. (Or so it is alleged; I haven&#39;t seen that first hand).</p>
<p>In early August, 2013, the TOR network was compromised. A popular browser for the system, the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_self">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, was attacked with a Javascript exploit that causes the nominally anonymous system to report its real IP address and MAC address to a central server, thus decloaking the device. The allegations are flying around as to who did this attack, but it&#39;s been alleged that a government is behind it because there are no indications that the exploit inserts any malware - just this deanonymizing task.</p>

      <p>&quot;Make the pile smaller&quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Making the pile smaller is also a good way of dealing with a rotten smell in compost piles due to anaerobic conditions, <a href="http://umaine.edu/publications/1159e/" target="_self">says</a> the U of Maine extension.</p>

<p>MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

I knew him from high school in Marquette (from debate and High School Bowl) and hadn't stayed in touch for years, so this was a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-600wi" alt="Greg-peters-high-school-bowl" /></a><br />Bottom, from left: Tom Baldini (coach), me (alternate), Greg Peters, Joel White, Kerry Johnson, Mike Coyne, David Goldsmith (host). "Nothing you learn is ever wasted."</p>
<p>The obit as published in NOLA.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cartoonist and writer Greg Peters died Friday morning, Aug. 2, after emergency surgery at Ochsner Medical Center. Mr. Peters, who had suffered from a congenital heart condition throughout his life, was 50 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Marquette, Mich., Peters arrived in Louisiana in 1990 to pursue a doctorate in English literature at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He became best known as the creator of “Suspect Device,” a starkly crafted, blackly funny Louisiana-themed political comic strip that made its debut in 1996, in the Times of Acadiana, and ran in New Orleans’&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/">Gambit Weekly</a>&nbsp;from 1999 to 2010. “Suspect Device” famously pulled no punches: In 1998, editor Harris Meyer resigned from the Times of Acadiana, when the paper’s publisher refused to run one of Mr. Peters’ strips.</p>
<p>“Suspect Device” was recognized with awards from the Press Club of New Orleans and the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, and in 2004 was anthologized in “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r18Or31mODcC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=greg+peters+attitude+2&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ih78UY3HG8iWqQHx7YFw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=greg%20peters%20attitude%202&amp;f=false">Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists</a>.” Mr. Peters’ work was displayed in exhibitions in conjunction with the book at New York City’s Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art.</p>
<p>Greg Peters was “one of the few alternative weekly political cartoonists whose mission is to skewer local and state politicians," anthology editor Ted Rall told Gambit’s Scott Jordan in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/unusual-suspect/Content?oid=1243221">a 2004 profile of Mr. Peters</a>. "One would think that there would be such a cartoonist, or several, in every major city, but there just aren't,” he said.</p>
<p>“Coupled with an over-the-top clip-art style and incredibly distinct cartooning personality, Greg's strip is everything that his readers and editors can hope for."</p>
<p>Mr. Peters’ distinctive style involved the use of stock clip art images, arranged and annotated with wry, extensive text to skewer public figures.</p>
<p>"The clip art thing was always a punk staple," Mr. Peters told Jordan. "Like the cut-out letters and clip art that Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols designer, did using Queen Elizabeth with the safety clip through her cheek picture. They're very much out of the DIY ethos. And the attitude simply of baseline mistrust for authority, and the demand that you be shown, not told."</p>
<p>Greg Peters is survived by his parents, Reg and Kay Peters of Lafayette; his partner, Eileen Loh; his former wife, Saundra Scarce; and his two sons, Wilder, 12, and Magnus, 10. Plans for a memorial service in the New Orleans area are pending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And what about the times I took her along with me to the Barnstable County Fair - when I could have gone with the boys? We rode the Tilt-A-Whirl and the Octopus, and she squeezed my arm so hard you could see the fingerprints for a week.</p>

(I also had a beach nearby and a room full of relatives). Here&#39;s some observations from the mobile-only internet.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it&#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass. My online composition is sufficiently slow that I can&#39;t come anywhere near close to keeping up with my thoughts. So long writing is right out. </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t blog during the trip, and I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a bad thing. There were a handful of occasions where I used Twitter, and I took a few photos that are sharable. Again, because it&#39;s so hard to type, it was easy to let the moment go past.</p>
<p>Twitter was too addictive, as a kind of intermittent reinforcement made it possible to repeatedly swipe down the screen, hear a little click, and then hope that the new tweets were interesting enough to make it worthwhile. I followed a few new busy accounts and was treated to inning by inning baseball scores and some random bits of new weather. I&#39;ll have to unfollow most of them now - that is one nice thing about Twitter compared to Facebook in that you can get a temporary enthusiasm and then shed it quickly.</p>
<p>Email was hard - I could keep up with a little bit of it, but it was daunting to try to answer messages that were long. I knew I was going to be back soon so I let it pile up. I&#39;ll have to try a longer experiment with email to see if I could either shift the context of the emails off to voice or direct message or text message so that there wasn&#39;t such a need to follow throug with endless paragraphs.</p>
<p>I could get used to the mobile-only Internet. It was possible to ignore a lot of what landed in my inbox over the span of a vacation, and the few longer or more important messages will be easy enough to answer.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>With 25 days to go, the <a href="http://kck.st/15DFqqb" target="_self">FOIA Machine kickstarter</a> is almost 2x overfunded. They are looking to build a system for automatically tracking and managing FOIA requests.</p>
<p>I am not clear how this effort differs from the already existing MuckRock News system, but there&#39;s room for innovation in the space because FOIA can be the world&#39;s worst search engine and any help is welcomed.</p>

      <p><p>I&rsquo;ve written before about the practice of keeping urban chickens. Inevitably some of those chickens will be abandoned by their owners.
