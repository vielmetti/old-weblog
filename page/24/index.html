<blockquote><br /><em>The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm</em><br /> <br />The house was quiet and the world was calm.<br />The reader became the book; and summer night<br /> <br />Was like the conscious being of the book. <br />The house was quiet and the world was calm.<br /> <br />The words were spoken as if there was no book,<br />Except that the reader leaned above the page,<br /> <br />Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be<br />The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom<br /> <br />The summer night is like a perfection of thought.<br />The house was quiet because it had to be. <br /> <br />The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind:<br />The access of perfection to the page.<br /> <br />And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world, <br />In which there is no other meaning, itself<br /><br />Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself<br />Is the reader leaning late and reading there.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />— Wallace Stevens</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, along the way, I also found this <a href="http://faculty.goucher.edu/eng215/concordances_and_author_horizon.htm">Concordances and the Authors' Horizon of Words' Meaning</a>, a way to start looking at how poets use words through tools that include "keyword in context".</p>

<p>In a 1969 speech against war protesters, he said, &quot;A spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals.&quot; &quot;In the United States today,&quot; Agnew told a 1970 audience in San Diego, &quot;we have more than our share of the nattering nabobs of negativism.&quot; He went after &quot;pusillanimous pussyfooters&quot; and &quot;vicars of vacillation&quot; and &quot;the hopeless, hysterical hypochondriacs of history.&quot;</p>

This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography. So, how about if I design one that will catch most of the light from my on-camera flash, and direct the bulk of it into the relatively small volume that I actually want to illuminate?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>That&#39;s a question I often pose at the beginning of projects, and one that I struggle with often when there is no simple answer.&#0160; Some reflection has me thinking it might be too simple a question to pose when goals are complex and long term and emergent.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll illustrate with a project that by some multiple measures has been successful so far, my weekly lunch meeting called a2b3.&#0160; Every week we gather for lunch, people eat, they talk, they leave.&#0160; At various times I&#39;ve tried to determine what to tally up to see if I&#39;m doing the right thing, and no number that I make visible ever holds up to repeated fixation.&#0160;</p>
<p>How do you measure success of a weekly meeting?&#0160; There&#39;s one simple measure of attendance, though we have filled the restaurant and don&#39;t plan to move so there&#39;s no real way to grow beyond the 20 to 30 or so that are normally there.&#0160; When on the odd week that there&#39;s a low turnout of 15 the lunch is so different and enjoyable that that feels like success too.&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself counting the number of people who are long time regulars, and also counting the number of people who are new.&#0160; Both seem like good people to have.&#0160; It can take a while to meet someone new until there&#39;s some other good connection, so my ability to add people to my world seems fixed - if the whole group was either people I already knew or people I didn&#39;t know that would be a challenge.</p>
<p>I also count the message traffic on the mailing list. &#0160;Email lists have some amount of channel capacity, so you want to have the list be busy enough to occupy the channel but not so busy that they cause people to turn it off or so idle that people forget it&#39;s there.</p>
<p>There is a degree of diversity to the group that surprises me, and what&#39;s more it surprises me that I don&#39;t need to do deliberate recruiting of anyone in order to get the occasional undergraduate or high school student or person from out of town or other demographic outlier to arrive.&#0160; It&#39;s perhaps because I don&#39;t keep track that makes it possible to be pleasantly surprised by how it feels like a broad cross-section of a corner of town.</p>
<p><strong>One easy measure of success is how well the group self-organizes when I&#39;m not there.&#0160;</strong>Some part of years of what might retrospectively be considered thoughtful planning is some zen quality of not needing to plan very much at all. &#0160;When I&#39;m not there, something still happens.</p>
<p>Traditional &quot;economic development&quot; organizations crow about their ability to attract or retain jobs, the number of events they organize, the value of square inches of favorable newsprint copy in ad-equivalent dollars, or the square feet of real estate they helped cause to be occupied. Those are all useful measurements when you&#39;re spending tax dollars, so that people doing accounting can have something to count. &#0160;But if all you are spending is lunch money, you better have a way to count on goodwill building up over time - credit toward some future, rather than a precise reckoning of the present.</p>

<p><strong>King-Littrell-Palmer Chicken Hatchery</strong></p>
<p><img  alt="The Hatchery" class="border " height="157" src="http://www.icgov.org/site/CMSv2/image/publicArt/klpchickenhatchery.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;" width="250" />Irving King, head of the University of Iowa Department of Literature, had an unusual sideline for an English professor: raising chickens. In 1918, King started a hatchery as a hobby on the south side of Jackson Avenue. Eventually, the hatchery occupied several wood structures from Sheridan
Avenue to Ralston Creek between the alley and Rundell Street. Fittingly, King's protégé in the poultry business was a poet: Ralph Littrell, who had a bachelor's degree from Iowa State University. By 1940, Littrell was the hatchery's owner and operator. At about the same time, a local builder named Lloyd Palmer bought the King home at 903 Dearborn Street from King's widow. Palmer, another hobbyist, ran a hatchery in the brick building west of the house until 1946.</p>
<p>Local residents bought dressed chickens and eggs here or from one of the many small neighborhood groceries that this hatchery supplied. Farmers came to buy live chickens. Chickens were sent by overnight train to Denver, and biweekly trucks would carry eggs to Chicago. Schoolteachers brought their classes to see the chicks, and the office was a popular place for neighbors to gather for conversation.</p>
<p>At one time, Iowa City had several hatcheries. Littrell's hatchery was the last one in town when it closed in 1986.</p>

<p>Iowa City is in the middle of an urban chicken imbroglio; here's a <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990928003">2009 story about chickens running loose in the streets.</a>  An online organizing group <a href="http://iowacityurbanchickens.ning.com/">IC Friends of Urban Chickens</a> aims to "put the Iowa back in Iowa City."  In March, local police <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/88904712.html">confiscated chickens during a traffic stop</a> because state laws require permits to transport animals across borders.  (There were also squirrels in the car.)</p>

<p>USA Today points to the <a href="http://www.urbanchickens.net/2009/11/iowa-city-mayor-baileys-odd-anti.html">Iowa City mayor, Regenia Bailey</a> as the source for anti-backyard poultry sentiment; this is apparently a reaction to the risk that domestic fowl present to state agribusiness.
<blockquote>
"We have a lot of small farmers around here making chickens and eggs available for sale," Bailey says. "My fundamental question is: Why aren't we supporting the regional economy?"

      <p>James Poulos in a <a href="http://www.ricochet.com/conversations/Where-Are-All-the-Editors/(comment)/8368">comment on Ricochet</a> on the role of editors:</p>
<blockquote>Writers now have competing pressures -- to be witty, quick, ironic, noticeable, flip, to dispatch every clay pigeon tossed up by a culture pandemic with pigeons; but also to self-edit, to self-moderate, to be reticent at the right time, to pussyfoot expertly, to pick battles, to avoid perils, to besmirch rarely, to duck blame, to satisfy spectral overseers. This is a serious pickle, is it not? And yet it now appears to be the cost of doing business. Possibly, this is the internet imitating life.</blockquote>
<p>I loved the &quot;satisfy spectral overseers&quot; bit. Where did that come from? Who gets that description?</p>
<p>Knute Rockne, in a H.W. Wilson Company 1942 biography:</p> 
<blockquote>No one will ever tackle the job of football coach at the University of Notre Dame without a sense of solemn obligation, for the spirit of Knute Rockne still hovers above the campus like a spectral overseer. 
</blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney, as referenced in two 1990s management texts:</p>
<blockquote>Eisner came aboard and cleared the deck, bringing in new managers, most of whom had never met Disney. The new crew, freed of the spectral overseer, began to create a culture that was more sophisticated than stodgy, more adventurous than cautious, more ambitious than content.</blockquote>
<p>John Edward McCullough, from the <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org/location/ghost.htm">National Theatre</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The shade of Actor John Edward McCullough, a popular American thespian of the 1800&#39;s, is said to roam the premises of the theatre in the dark of night. No longer thirsting for an audience&#39;s applause, the once famed star performer has taken on the lonely role of ghostly custodian and spectral overseer, checking to be sure that all is in readiness for the next performance.</blockquote>
<p>I for one welcome the editorial guidance of our spectral overseers. But whose guidance should we channel for this task? &#0160;That&#39;s some other post about people (not necessarily &quot;writers&quot;) who have mastered the online form.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>An essay published in <a href="http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/in-defense-of-the-memory-theater/">Open Letters Monthly.</a></p>
<blockquote>What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">I fear for our memory theaters.</span></blockquote>
<p>Any essay of lamentation about the end of books and the glory of human memory has to include some touchstones.  Frances Yates is that touchstone here:</p>
<blockquote>One of the books that I used to habitually pick up from my college library, and which, recently, I finally bought used, is <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Frances Yates</span>’s classic <span style="background-color: #ffdfbf;">The Art of Memory</span>. First published in 1966, it chronicles lost mnemonic techniques, passed down from the ancient orators to the Renaissance humanists: spaces people would conjure in their minds to help them remember all the precious accoutrements of civilized knowledge.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-pi"><img alt="The Art of Memory" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538f3bef0a970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="The Art of Memory" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>One of the pleasures of writing incessantly online is the likelihood that you&#39;ve run across something before, even if you don&#39;t have it in the top of memory.  Prentiss Riddle wrote about <a href="http://aprendizdetodo.com/time/?item=20030331">The Art of Memory</a> in 2003, apparently because I mentioned it on a mailing list, saying this:</p>
<blockquote>[Frances Yates], [The Art of Memory] -- just getting started on this one, which is an account of the history of mnemotechnics: the art and practice of expanding and augmenting the human memory. The classical account of this goes back to <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Simonides of Ceos</span>, who had memorized all of the names and seating arrangements of the attendees at a banquet while giving a speech to them and was thus able to identify the dead when the banquet hall collapsed. Ancient orators used these memory systems to memorize long, long speeches.</blockquote>
<p>Now, armed with a new word &quot;mnemotechnic&quot;, I can go through and pluck out this precious specimen from Google Books; the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ImcPAAAAYAAJ">Phreno-mnemotechnic dictionary</a>, a work from 1844 by <span style="background-color: #bfdfff;">Francis Fauvel-Gourand</span> with a preface that illustrates the noted figures in the history of those who have an exceptional memory. The bulk of the work is a dictionary compiled along the principles of &quot;soundex&quot;, where words with similar consonant structure are indexed together and given a number.  Thus you will find on page 62 the entry for 382 (&quot;homophony&quot;, &quot;muffin&quot;); to make this make sense, you need to get a mapping between the &quot;m&quot; sound and the number 3, &quot;f&quot; or &quot;ph&quot; and 8, &quot;n&quot; and 2, and then encode.</p>
<p>Could there be any practical use for this?  Certainly; this is a <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">learned synesthesia</span>, where numbers turn into words.  If you ever have had to memorize a license plate number (I am looking at one where the partial plate is &quot;6981&quot;) you know it&#39;s hard.  But knowing that 69 maps to &quot;sheep&quot; and 81 maps to &quot;fat&quot; means that this vehicle can be memorialized as &quot;sheepfat&quot;, which is wonderful in its own way.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ddebe2;">Now where was I?  Distracted, I guess</span>.  Like Nathan Schneider, my memories are indexed in part through the books I have been reading.  The bookshelf that he evokes, carefully collected, is the memory construct that says that when you pull in one book you want to be able to leaf through the one next to it on the bookshelf, or the whole shelf full of them assembled for a purpose.  You judge the quality of a story told through books by the quality and comprehensiveness of the books invoked to tell it, and you look for the bibliography eagerly for texts you have missed.</p>
<p>My bookshelves are too small to hold all the books that might sit on them, but sometimes there have been ways to make up for that.  The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/3177427/">photo of the bookshelf</a> provides some substitute to prove not only that you have had the books but also that you know that some go together with others.</p>

      <p>A comment I wrote on Ethan Hein&#39;s <a href="http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2009/in-the-sequencer-the-notation-is-the-performance">account of color-coding sequencer tracks:</a></p>
<blockquote>When you say “<span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">color coding improved your ears</span>”, the first thing that comes to mind is that you are doing some kind of machine-assisted <span style="background-color: #ffff80;">synesthesia</span>. very cool, that.</blockquote>
<p>another enticing pice from <a href="http://oblong.com/article/085zBpRSY9JeLv2z.html">oblong industries</a></p>
<blockquote>It&#39;s true that one of the elements is a blue ball that bounces in time to the music and touches down on the notes that are playing just then. Also true: a ball like that can never be entirely serious, but it can be entirely effective. What works is assisted <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">synaesthesia</span>, making sound seem like sight and looking seem like hearing. The time in which music happens is turned into the space of the animated score.</blockquote>
<p>And then pretty quickly we hit this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6YTQJVzwlI">video of John Underkoffler at TED</a> on the future of the user interface.  Not quite what I was after, very lovely in its own Minority Report style but not for the perspective I was after.</p>
<p>This has <a href="http://jaicoxkiod.blogspot.com/">an interesting perspective from a <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">synaesthete</span>, but I won&#39;t quote</a> based on the copyright:</p>

(2005), &quot;Artificial <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">Grapheme-Color Synesthesia</span> for Wearable Task Support&quot;, Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 108-113</p>
<blockquote>This paper presents the benefits of generating an artificial <span style="background-color: #ffbfdf;">visual synesthesia</span> through a wearable computer. Following a short introduction to remind the need for seamless human-wearable computer interactions, this paper makes the case for drawing upon synesthesia, a combination of the senses naturally occurring in a small portion of the population, to augment everyday entities and more precisely to enrich written graphemes. We present the rationale behind our research and summarize the functionality, architecture and implementation of our current prototype. Preliminary results suggest that this kind of <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">artificial synesthesia improves short term memory recall and visual information search times</span>.</blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1124772.1124828">the followup paper</a> crucially gives the link to augmented reality</p>
<blockquote>This paper studies a novel approach advocating the virtual alteration of real-world interfaces through a form of augmented reality. Following an introduction reminding the need for easy to use and more consistent interfaces across our many day to day devices, this paper makes the case for using wearable computers to enhance the interactions between humans and conventional appliances. We present the rationale behind our research and summarize our current prototype&#39;s functionalities, architecture and implementation. Preliminary results suggest that <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">virtually altering the interface of real world devices improves execution times for simple tasks using these devices.</span></blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>Hiding in municipal archives across the county are maps of where the freeways will go. &nbsp;Some of them got built, some of them didn't. &nbsp;Those documents will date from after the Second World War, and lots of them will be 1950s and 1960s artifacts.</p>

<p>Some of the history will show up in land records; this <a href="http://www.genoa.org/community/history">account from Genoa Township</a> looks typical</p>
<blockquote>
The land was farmed from 1950 until 1962 when the Michigan State Highway came through and condemned eight different parcels in the township to construct Interstate 96. The State Highway Department gave the homesteaders 30 days to get out of their way. The Herbst family received $17,500 for their condemned 43.9 acres, which was then cut in half on a 45° angle.
</blockquote>

<p>Before the land was suddenly condemned, there must have been maps, drawing, photos, studies.</p>

      <em>What&#39;s brown and sticky? &#0160;A stick.</em><p>One of my favorite parts of the Huron River, strange as it may seem, is the mill race downstream of Argo Dam. &#0160;It&#39;s utterly unloved, used for recreation only as a canoe portage.</p><p>M. and I went to the spillway that connects this mill race with the Huron, just upstream of the Detroit Edison Argo Substation. &#0160;There was a lot of trash - sticks, logs, aquatic weeds of various kinds, the odd can and bottle - clogging the spillway. &#0160;I brought two old cross-country ski poles, and we went stick fishing. &#0160; The object is to catch a stick and then pull it so it goes over the spillway. &#0160;</p><p>Both ends of the ski pole are useful. &#0160;The pointy end is better for poking and pulling. &#0160;The grip end has a loop to secure your hand in which can be used to snag a branch. &#0160;If you twist the loop you get a secure hold and can pull just about anything.</p><p>When we were done stick fishing, most of the spillway was free of brush and weeds.</p><p>We did see one couple who had caught some bluegills somewhere nearby, don&#39;t know exactly where.</p>

"Observed" data is a byproduct of National Weather Service (NWS) operations at the 12 CONUS River Forecast Centers (RFCs), and is displayed as a gridded field with a spatial resolution of roughly 4x4 km. "Observed" data is expressed as a 24-hour total ending at 1200 Z (same as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT), with longer periods simply being a summation of multiple 24-hour periods. 1200 GMT is used as the ending time for a 24-hour total, because it is the end of the "hydrologic day", a standard used in river modeling. Additionally, 1200 GMT closely coincides with the reporting time for most of the National Weather Service's cooperative observers, whose data are used as a quality control on the dataset. 1200 GMT coincides with 8 AM EDT, 7 AM EST, 7 AM CDT, 6 AM CST, etc.

<p>Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac. This 1989 Oxford Paperbacks edition, ISBN 0-19-505928-X, as an introductory essay from Robert Finch commemorating the 100th anniversary of Leopold's birth.</p>

<blockquote>We see Leopold, the rural sage, tracking a sunk in January, cutting a venerable dead oak, stalking a legendary fish on Alder Fork or an elusive grouse on an abandoned farm, surveying his private unofficial domain before dawn, wrestling with god-like decisions about tree-thinning, or experiencing a "curious transfusion of courage" from his pines in deep winter.</blockquote>

      <p>I had a disturbing thought while rereading <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm">Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s piece on Nassim Taleb</a> in his latest book which collects his New Yorker essays. What if Taleb is not only profiting from unknownable random adverse events, but also encouraging their proliferation?</p>

<p>The logic runs like this. You place a series of bets, where if you lose you lose $1 and if you win you win $1000000. The bets are on some implausible condition, one which (at the outset) there is no chance of happening. You bet the first time, you lose; the counterparty is $1 richer and one iota more confident. You bet again.</p>

<p>If there really is a one in a million chance of winning, in the long run you will break even. The scary notion, though is the thought that by losing over and over again you can change the probabilities of the game, so that once you have lost 1000 times your opponent - who is $1000 richer - will start making decisions about how they conduct their business that increases the chance that you will win this long-shot bet.</p>

<p>Your series of losses are funding the adversary&#39;s bad behavior. They are up $1000, haven&#39;t lost in 3 years, have an unbroken string of fiscal quarters where each and every quarter they beat the analysts estimates by a penny. Management becomes bolder, knowing that their track record demands that they confidently take on risks that 3 or 6 or 12 years ago whey would have shunned. After a long interrupted run of good fortune misinterpreted as careful skill they seek out the next incrementally more risky and profitable opportunity in order to pursue the growth that you have funded.</p>

<p>I&#39;m challenged to reconcile the strategy of &quot;small wins&quot;, where you look to succeed in small ways over and over again to build confidence, with the Taleb style strategy of &quot;small losses&quot; where you take lots and lots of calibrated long shot bets that often lose. It&#39;s discouraging to think that the confidence that you are building with the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=karl+weick+small+wins&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart">Karl Weick style small win strategy</a> of building upon small incremental gains might be deliberately funded by someone who is set up to profit big time if you grow for a long time and then lose it all.</p>

<p>Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context:</p>

<p>Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Art-of-Living-Mindfully/63292/?sid=at">The Art of Living Mindfully</a> on the work of <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/">Ellen Langer</a>. Her <a href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/blog/">blog</a> is not frequent but it is thoughtful.</p>

<blockquote>
We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless. We have been taught absolutes when none really exist independent of context. When we think we know something absolutely, we have learned that it is reasonable never to question it, nor to pay attention to how it may be otherwise. Beliefs and behavior always make some kind of sense from the actor’s perspective or else the actor would have done otherwise. Blame suggests mindlessness on the part of the blamer who does not recognize this. We are not at fault for what we do not know just because someone else can see a way we could have known it.
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1550775">Just Breathe: Meditation as Organizational Slack</a> is a paper by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kaisa-holloway-cripps/3/ba7/b62">Kaisa G. Holloway Cripps</a>. &#0160;Mostly a literature review, it looks at meditation inside an organization and identifies ways where it may be useful to engage human resources that are slack. &#0160;The discussion reminds me of MBA consultants who work like dogs for months and then are periodically &quot;on the beach&quot; for a while when their gig is up.</p>

<p>I quickly hit Buddhism when I look up this phrase, the parts of Buddhism that I haven&#39;t lived close enough to that I appreciate all of the subtleties of the words.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>We measure things that are easy to measure about media, like</p><ul>
<li>time on page, time on site
</li>
<li>click through rate
</li>
<li>conversion rate to some desired action
</li>
<li>frequency of interaction
</li>
<li>responsiveness of interaction
</li>
<li>hot spots that are getting lots of attention
</li>
<li>&quot;lag&quot;, whatever that is, but everyone knows what it is
</li>
</ul>

In general, media that have small amounts of lag are good for gaming, because you can play many small bets and iteratively define a better result. As the amount of lag increases, the attention games change, and you start to get out of the realm of reality-based feedback and into the realm of ROI fictions, and systems that have enormous expensive command and
control infrastructures.&#0160;
<p>It’s one thing to hack people’s attention about tomorrow if you start working on it today, and something very different to plan a campaign that results in their attention (or the fulfillment of their desire) 6 or 12 or 18 or 120 months hence.&#0160;</p><p>Originally written for <a href="http://twitter.com/kevindoylejones">Kevin Doyle Jones</a>, and published obscurely in 2007; rescued and republished with only minor edits 3 years hence.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m trying to figure out how to retell stories about a place that I only know a little about. &#0160;The particular spot is a <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Clague&#39;s_Grocery">one time grocery store</a>, now a bicycle shop, that I am guessing was a center of a neighborhood in its time. If there ever was a lore around it, it circulates among a group of people who I don&#39;t know. &#0160;The owner of the store was notable in his day, but that day is about 60 years ago.</p><p>My usual routine is to find an interesting idea, do searches in unexpected locations that get uncommon results, and assemble a story from clippings of things already written. &#0160;This can be a fast way of going from scattered and fragmentary information about something to a composed account that makes sense. Clippings are easy to assemble, someone else has done the work, and you can sit down and be done when you&#39;re done.</p><p>What&#39;s harder for me is to write about something that no one else has written down, especially something which you in turn have only limited knowledge of. &#0160;The quotable information from print sources may be locked up in materials that are not scanned in, and perhaps never scanned in unless you scan them in yourself - that is, if you can find anything at all. &#0160;The real stories of how things were might only be tellable if you can locate someone to tell them to you and if you write the stories down carefully for them.</p><p>If you are interested in something and want to publish something about it to mark that interest, you might end up with only a fragment to start. &#0160;There are some media where it&#39;s acceptable to tell a piece of a story that&#39;s an incomplete image, but only a very few. &#0160;&quot;That&#39;s not news&quot; and &quot;what&#39;s your point&quot; are typical reactions when a newspaper behaves that way. &#0160;The encyclopedia&#39;s defense mechanism says &quot;that&#39;s not notable&quot;. &quot;Too long, didn&#39;t read&quot; is the reaction in the blog world. &#0160;So you need some place to dump fragments that don&#39;t have to be complete that&#39;s safe so when it comes time to tell a story you can extend your memory.</p><p>Nothing gets around the problem that the real stories can only be told by people. &#0160;That&#39;s an opportunity and a challenge.</p><p></p>

      <p>I have a shiny phone with more computing power than the first computer I ever owned. &#0160;I also have a shiny brick, because the phone isn&#39;t working now, and when I took it back to where I bought it they gave me a phone number to call to fix it. &#0160;(I call it my BrickBerry. &#0160;It&#39;s so bricked, it doesn&#39;t even play Brickout.)

<p>Smart phones aren&#39;t cheap, but increasingly they don&#39;t seem all that smart either. &#0160;Shiny, yes; futuristic and wonderful, sure. &#0160;But smart, not so much. &#0160;Does your phone remind you of what you need to do, when and where you need to do it, but not so naggingly that you turn it off? &#0160;Probably not. &#0160;Does that smart phone make you look smarter when you&#39;re walking down the street punching buttons on it? &#0160;Not so sure. <a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/status/5560837946">Twittering from the bus to let the planet know which bus has squeaky brakes?</a> &#0160;Uh huh.</p><p>The trap, perhaps, is confusing &quot;smart phone&quot; with &quot;smart person&quot;. &#0160;Does a smart phone make you smart?</p>

<p>One possibility is to ditch phones with contracts entirely and go to a prepaid plan, which means that every call would cost something and I&#39;ve have to be smart about how to use my phone. &#0160;That turns out to be easier now that I have Google Voice, which gives me more tools than ever to not answer my phone but still get a message to me. &#0160;Google Voice lets me direct any call to any phone, and thus the cell phone simply becomes another selectable destination to originate or terminate calls on the same number.</p>

<a href="http://img.metblogs.com/sanjose/files/2008/11/metblogs-logo.jpg" style="float: right;"><img alt="image from img.metblogs.com" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c selected " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0134817d871b970c-800wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="image from img.metblogs.com" /></a> <a href="http://www.metblogs.com">Metblogs</a> was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://jpd.me/2010/05/21/metblogs-series-finale/">Metblogs series finale</a>:</p><blockquote>[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May.</blockquote>
The metblogs network never intersected with my world, so I don&#39;t know whether this is just the passing of time or some kind of deep-seated, widely felt loss. Their stats:
<blockquote>
<a href="http://detroit.metblogs.com/">Detroit Metblogs</a>: 2,218 posts / 3,722 comments
</blockquote>
which I have to compare with Vacuum, just to give some sense of scale and scope (since 2003 when I started on Typepad):
<blockquote>
2229 Total Posts, 2033 Total Comments
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s all kinds of business models that have to change with time. I can only say that because I lived through the era when modems ruled the Internet, and then after that when they didn&#39;t. So it&#39;s no failing to have started something that was a good idea at the time and then discover that times have changed and your idea doesn&#39;t have a neat transition to the current day.
</p>

<p>Some parts of the Metblogs network died a bit earlier. This <a href="http://morehockeylesswar.org/blog/archive/2008/06/18/the_death_of_portland_metblogs/">2008 post on the situation in Portland</a> signals what happens when founders intent, advertiser interest, and core contributor passions don&#39;t line up:</p>
<blockquote>
There could still be hope for Metblogs. My suggestions of public journalism, open comments and revenue sharing to attract quality writers were met with hostility when I floated them before. Metblogs could be a voice in the Portland digital media milieu. But most likely it will quietly fade further into irrelevance.</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s their <a href="http://www.metblogs.com/news/2010/05/21/well-that-just-happened/">official going out of business notice</a>. &#0160;Here&#39;s <a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/metblogs/">a feature about them from Wordpress</a>, the platform that they had used.</p>

<p>Noted on Twitter by <a href="http://www.thenetworkthinker.com/">Valdis Krebs</a>, who asks</p>
<blockquote>starting to see the end of the &quot;blog phase&quot; of the Web? Or just the assimilation of another &quot;form&quot; into the whole?</blockquote>

<p>If blogs are being assimilated, what are they being assimilated into? &#0160;If they go into newspapers, you get editors and deadlines and a hesitance to be interested in everything in favor of something narrower and more marketable. If the blogger becomes a diarist, then the novelty is writing for the world but not the form itself. Perhaps some bloggers are just frustrated talk radio hosts? &#0160;There are lots of possibilities to be assimilated into another established media form and not to create some new art form.</p>

<p>Another relevant touchpoint is the end of <a href="http://arborupdate.com">Arbor Update</a>, which closed down after a 6 year run. &#0160;In my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/links-arbor-update-blogroll/">requiem for Arbor Update</a>, I note that it gave up the ghost after many of its contributors who were also regular bloggers stopped blogging regularly. &#0160;This suggests a life cycle for blogging that matches what used to happen on Usenet; a cadre would form, start writing together, and then at some point their lives got busy or they got out of grad school or their public writing style needed to be formal and they left en masse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some epidemic model of when blogging stops, which would say something similar to the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370">Framingham obesity study</a> - when your friends stop blogging, you are likely to stop blogging. &#0160;It&#39;s not that any one thing got in the way; it&#39;s just that the cool kids had a million followers on Twitter, and the eyeballs of the media buyers were diverted toward how you could be more like them. &#0160;Or it may be as simple as not seeing eye to eye with a handful of people who are core to your effort and not being able to restart once they leave.</p>

      <p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.</p>
<p>I had to hit &quot;shift-refresh&quot; to force everything to load.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new. &#0160;How few things work that way!</p>
<p>It was especially nice that when I picked a photo to use for the theme, that the system suggested an appropriate accompanying color palette.</p>
<p>Also noted, 5/22/2010: as author, my top navigation bar has an &quot;edit post&quot; button, so I can change things well after the fact. &#0160;This is promising. &#0160;I do notice that there are no archives links anymore and no easy way for anyone to notice that I&#39;ve been plugging away at this for years, but the &quot;search&quot; box is very welcomed, and should unearth some things that would have otherwise been buried.</p>
<p>3/19/11: The design I had picked was &quot;Chroma&quot;. I&#39;ve swapped that out for &quot;Journal Black&quot;, which served to restore the category and archive links. --Ed</p>
<p>4/24/13: Now using the &quot;Clean&quot; theme, with radically simplified sidebars.</p>

<p>Google Books is my first search for this stuff, but I wanted to give the query narrowing "search only fiction". &nbsp;Can't do that; ah, perhaps I can; "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?&q=subject%3Afiction+torpor&btnG=Search+Books">subject:fiction torpor</a>" looks pretty good. &nbsp;From The Count of Monte-Cristo:</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</p>

<p>When you're on with a vision of how something could or should be, that great idea of yours is a liability, not an asset. It's going to take some huge amount of effort or activation of an existing set of skills or knowledge to go from bright idea to something that someone else can buy into. Resist the temptation to let other people have your perspective on the world spelled out to them too clearly before it gets a chance to adapt to circumstances, or at the very least if you are going to do this for someone for money sell them something that captures not just the time spent in that room but the whole world that you bring to making that room reflect reality.</p>
