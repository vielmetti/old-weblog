        <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.
It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-22-on-the-virtue-of-cheap-paper/">&raquo;</a></p>

&quot;It&#39;s not too hot and could be a little warmer,&quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &quot;But the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket for the plants. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-14-michigan-2009-strawberry-season-delayed-by-cold-weather/">&raquo;</a></p>

The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.

Grady Burnett, who led Google Inc.’s advertising operation in Ann Arbor, has taken a position with Palo Alto, Calif.-based social media giant Facebook.com as it launches a revenue growth push.
Burnett now runs Facebook’s global online and inside sales.
Ann Arbor is the headquarters of Mountain View, Calif.-based Google’s AdWords division, the pay-per-click, search term-based advertising that’s the company’s primary source of revenue.

        <p>telegraphic codes and message practice Buell&#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-04-links-for-2009-06-04/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s a novel reuse of an old copper mine - the Miner&rsquo;s Revenge bicycle race is using a 1&frasl;3 mile long section of the mine no longer in active use as a part of the race course.&nbsp; Bring your own lights - it&rsquo;s dark in there.
 The race is July 11-12, 2009, with free on-site camping for racers and a bonfire the night before. Greenland is near Ontonagon; the mine is owned by the Adventure Mining Company which also does walking tours as well as other more extreme mining adventures that involve rappelling down a mine shaft. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-03-miners-revenge-bicycle-race-in-greenland-mi-in-an-underground-copper-mine/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This seems to be a plausible strategy - people send you interesting things that you want to remember, so you post them to your blog so that when you search for them you find them.
If the blog seems overful of cut and paste of events sometimes, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m necessarily going to be going to all of them - who can do that with two kids at home! - but that it seemed like the best way to deal with an influx of details. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-on-emptying-your-inbox-into-your-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

SUNDAY JUNE 7th

 Award-Winning Film Indestructible and panel discussion
 
Ann Arbor Active Against ALS (A2A3) is sponsoring a screening of the award-winning film “Indestructible” to raise awareness about ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) and raise funds for research. &#0160;&#0160;

“Indestructible” was created by Ben Byer, a young filmmaker who chronicles his experience with ALS (Lou Gehrig&#39;s Disease) and his search for a treatment across six different countries. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-indestructible-june-7-2009-at-michigan-theater-sponsored-by-ann-arbor-active-against-als/">&raquo;</a></p>

STRAWBERRY SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!! 
The first day of the 2009 strawberry season will be Wednesday June 3rd. As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&#0160; ready to pick.

        <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.
Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-pretending-to-be-on-an-airplane/">&raquo;</a></p>
