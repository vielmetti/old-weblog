<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

New Orleans, where a transparent recovery and historic preservation are

ancient and new maps of the city’s original development and

                <div class="delicious-extended">I thought I’d take some time this week to mention a couple of new sites built with MT. First, MovableType.com has a story about The San Francisco Appeal, an online newspaper dedicated to local SF news. Somewhat similar, ChicagoNow is a collection of blogs providing news and information about Chicago neighborhoods. Owned by Tribune Media and developed by Byrne Reese, ChicagoNow is a community site for all of Chicago. Soon, they will be rolling out Motion-based functionality.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Editor &amp; Publisher recently remarked about the difficulty in maintaining and moderating user comments:</p>

<p>    ..traffic volume has made it difficult for any but the wealthiest media operations to monitor user comments as diligently as they do letters to the editor or “talk backs” to news directors. The combination of virtually open access and limited oversight has turned these public squares into mosh pits, without the latter&#039;s youthful exuberance or bonhomie.</p>

<p>Trying to adhere to policies that work to keep rules in place without disrupting or silencing the passionate voices of their readers have challenged media operators. Yet, many news media have taken steps in striking a balance between quality and quantity.</div><br />

      <p>Of course it isn&#39;t Wednesday yet, but I&#39;ll be a day early.</p><p>One of the things I&#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&#39;t exist yet.&#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen.</p><p>Every so often people do edit this page - but often they don&#39;t.&#0160; </p><p>A reasonable goal is to try to minimize the number of times people get frustrated, so one way to track that is to look at the fraction of pages over time where people hit a blank page and try to minimize that.&#0160; Looking at it over the last 3 months it appears that 3.2% of page views go to a page that doesn&#39;t exist yet - if you do a &quot;Top Content&quot; report, and then filter for the string &quot;redlink&quot;, you&#39;ll get what you want.<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 5" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570540df2970c-800wi" title="Picture 5" /></a> </p><p>One way to do continuous improvement, then, is to run a simple report for the pages on any given day, and look through them for ones where people clicked and didn&#39;t find anything.&#0160; Go to those wanted pages and search until you can put in something at least minimal for them.</p><p>Today&#39;s crop of such pages includes the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann%20Arbor%20Wine%20Club">Ann Arbor Wine Club</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Edward%20Burger">Edward Burger</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michael%20R.%20Reid">Michael R.

                <div class="delicious-extended">For a lot of products, such as alarm clocks, you’re only going to write a review if you have a negative experience. How does Amazon get people to write reviews? Most people don’t leave reviews. About 0.7% of people who buy something leave a review. But because Amazon has such a huge amount of customers, that equates to quite a lot. So the next time someone says, &quot;we should have reviews; that works really well for Amazon,&quot; you can respond with &quot;sure, we should have customers too; that works really well for Amazon.&quot;</div>

The book describes the “sugaring off” parties in Vermont, where people hosted neighborhood celebrations as they finished off the annual tapping of sap from trees for maple syrup. It describes the making of persimmon beer among Mississippi African-Americans. In and around Darlington, South Carolina, people would host outdoor gatherings and serve “chicken bog,” a distinctive chicken-and-rice dish. Nebraskans loved buffalo barbeque and Wisconsin folks enjoyed sour-dough pancakes.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Also, although John spends more time and slightly more emphasis on comments directed towards ‘curmudgeons’, I would say that the abuse that he saw hurled toward Jessica da Silva by veteran journalists isn’t isolated to comments on blogs. The commenter Robert Knilands (aka Wenalway) may seem your run-of-the-mill troll, but he expresses a virulent form of prejudice too frequently directed towards online and young journalists by some - and I stress, only some - print journalists. Robert Knilands says:</p>

<p>    It can’t survive, though, as long as young journos are getting opportunities they are unqualified for and posting ignorant blog entries. All that does is destroy the present and the future.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.</p>

<p>It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all.</p>

<br />Saturday June 27, 2009: 10:00 am to 11:30 am -- <br />Downtown Library:
Multi-Purpose Room
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Bring your camera and explore Ann Arbor! Photowalk is a fun way to
capture photos of the beauty of Ann Arbor and then post them online
for all to see. Our first Photowalk is held in conjunction with the
Library’s summer reading program, Local Motion - which encourages the
use of local neighborhoods, gyms, recreational facilities and outdoor
areas to explore Ann Arbor and get fit. We will begin with
presentations by several local photography experts, including: Myra
Klarman, professional photographer specializing in studio and
lifestyle portraits, Michael C. Myers, local photographer and a
founding member of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and Leisa
Thompson, Ann Arbor News Staff Photographer. Following the lecture, at
11:30 am, we will go out in small groups to photograph Ann Arbor. The
results will be an online exhibit of your photos in the aadl.org
pictureAnnArbor collection.

            &lt;div class=&quot;delicious-extended&quot;&gt;Newspapers have more important things to do than worry about comments—like, say, report the stories that blogs so desperately need in their 24-7 quest for content! After all, blogs are often not equipped to regularly break the news, and we need content to chew on.
</code></pre>

<p>As Arthur Sulzberger&#039;s relation Benjamin Dolnick lamented in the comments section of Carr&#039;s NYT story (noticed by Choire Sicha at Radar): &quot;If you ever want to lose faith in humanity, read any comments section on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>P.S. Also, nobody wants to hear the tired old &quot;free speech&quot; argument as a defense of comments. We&#039;ve had free speech in this country for well over two hundred years, long before it was ever an option to comment on newspaper websites and blogs.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Brown agreed that reader comments are a &quot;really significant&quot; development in online journalism.</p>

<p>&quot;You could have a situation where you put up a story … and this amazing thing happens where people start taking your story apart, going through the facts — doing all sorts of background and fact-checking — better than any editor can do, because you&#039;ve got this crowd-source effort to go through every line of it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;At worst, it can be like YouTube&#039;s comment section where it&#039;s sort of like a bathroom in a subway station with all sorts of comments on the wall. Everybody&#039;s completely anonymous. No one has any sense of their reputation within that community, everyone&#039;s a troll.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Nowhere in the comments section, however, did readers hear anything from a staffer at the Tribune. No one with that authority stepped in to admonish the rude, correct those who posted wrong information, or to respond to those who had questions about the story. Without that leadership, the Tribune lost the opportunity to forge a community based on these readers&#039; common interest in this engaging story.

It also came to a head this week in Batavia, where the Daily News was hit by a particularly ugly comment thread in which a socket puppet attacked fellow elected officials, one politician is posing as a defender of said politician, and a community activist brought to light unfounded allegations against a city councilman (I won&#039;t dignify the charge by repeating it here, and because I know these people, it&#039;s pretty easy to figure out who&#039;s who).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">&quot;I&#039;ve also seen a noticeable change in tone in comments and other interactive forums, like Coveritlive.com. As soon as someone from the paper steps in and makes a comment, the whole tone changes. If you just give people a blank wall and a spray paint can, you get a predictable outcome. But as soon as anyone says we should stick to the topic or knock off the personal attacks, it has a noticeable effect.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s some reports from around the state of the strawberry crop.&#0160; (We&#39;re planning a trip to Rowe&#39;s in Rawsonville for Father&#39;s Day).</p><p><a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45468">From the Detroit Free Press via FreshPlaza:</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">At DeGroot&#39;s Strawberries in Gregory, 16 acres of lush plants are close to ripening.<br /><br />&quot;It&#39;s
not too hot and could be a little warmer,&quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who
with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &quot;But
the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket
for the plants.&quot;<br /><br />Pick-your-own strawberries will be $1.20 a
pound at DeGroot&#39;s this year. Whittaker&#39;s strawberries sell for $1.25 a
pound. And at Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Ypsilanti, the cost is $1.46 per
pound, up 3 cents from last year.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45470">From mlive.com again via FreshPlaza</a> on the season in mid-Michigan:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Geri R.

      </h3>
      <p>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.</p><p>The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.</p><p>UPDATE: Two Ann Arbor News stories by Judy McGovern:</p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/some_question_appropriateness.html">Some question appropriateness of mocking e-mail banter during Ann Arbor City Council meetings</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Sent from city e-mail accounts, the messages were released by the city
in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Great Lakes
Environmental Law Center.
</div><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The Detroit-based law center was seeking communication about the
city&#39;s planned underground parking structure on Fifth Avenue. What it
got, in addition, were a series of live e-mail exchanges among council
members during three meetings in February and March.</p>
<div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Some
of the messages discuss business on the council&#39;s agenda - such as
whether a vote will be postponed - but more often they spoofed the
proceedings.
<br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/not_all_ann_arbor_city_council.html">Not all Ann Arbor City Council meeting e-mails were horseplay</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition to quietly poking fun at individuals and groups before
them, some Ann Arbor City Council members apparently used their city
e-mail accounts during meetings to discreetly discuss city business.<br /></div><p>I don&#39;t know who all has sent in FOIA requests yet, or what will be printed - the best guess I have at this point is that something will show up in the Sunday paper.&#0160; I&#39;ve seen copies of what is evidently a very selectively edited set of messages from one meeting, in which one member of council sends email to most but not all members of council, awarding a &quot;golden vomit award&quot; to a council member not included on the email.&#0160; Is that teasing, ridicule, or an effort to influence future voting?&#0160; Hard to say.</p><p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act is not clear on the status of email communications as meetings.&#0160; An article in the <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/michigan/open-meetings-laws-michigan">Citizen Media Law Project</a> site says</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
Governmental bodies may hold meetings by by written, telephonic,
electronic, wireless, or other virtual means. However, an electronic
meeting is still subject to the notice requirements and must be held at
a designated place and time. While the law is not certain on this
point, it appears that email communications between members of a
governmental body may constitute a meeting if they involve deliberation
on public business.
</p><p>There&#39;s Open Meetings Act litigation underway in Texas, where the questions of balancing First Amendment rights to speech threaten to change laws across the country.&#0160; I don&#39;t understand all the repercussions, but here&#39;s the story from the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/05/17/0517speech.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> paper:</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">It started as a minor prosecution of two Alpine City Council members
accused of discussing city business in private e-mails and not, as
Texas law requires, in a public forum. </p> 
        

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, with a recent U.S. appeals court ruling, the 2004 incident is
mushrooming into a national issue — bringing denunciations from
open-government advocates who fear the decision will cripple laws that
ban elected officials from conducting public business behind closed
doors. </p> 
        

<p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">The controversy surrounds a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling
that the Texas Open Meetings Act compromised the Alpine council
members&#39; free speech rights and may have to be overturned or rewritten. </p><p><a href="http://www.bigbendsentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1714&amp;Itemid=1">The Big Bend Sentinel, the local paper for Alpine, TX, notes that this case may reach the Supreme Court</a> based on the intervention of attorney generals from multiple states.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">ALPINE – The recent federal appeals court ruling
in an Alpine Texas Open Meetings Act case that a public official’s
right to free speech is the same as a private citizens may eventually
find its way to the Supreme Court of the United States, an attorney in
the matter said this week.<br /><br />
“Nineteen states have weighed in saying it (the ruling) could change
their open meetings laws,” Alpine attorney Rod Ponton said. “That makes
it a national issue that would need to be decided by the Supreme Court.”<br /> <br />
On April 24, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, Louisiana, reversed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Rob Junell, who initially heard the civil lawsuit
brought by former Alpine City Council members Dr. Avinash Rangra and
Anna Monclova.</p><p>As I noted I expect more on this issue in the Sunday June 7 2009 news.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">These issues raise thorny problems for public-access advocates who say that at least some public officials are using electronic communication to evade the strictures of open-meetings laws. “It is a growing problem, and it is a problem which many states and municipalities are only beginning to think about in any systemic way,” says Charles N. Davis, executive director of the Freedom of Information Center at the University of Missouri.</p>

<p>“There are many instances out there where public officials are using personal e-mail for public business, mixing and mingling their e-mails with private and public business and using three-way and four-way e-mail conversations to hold quasi-public meetings,” Davis said.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">California has especially tough rules barring companies from restricting their employees&#039; job hunting. Many companies across the country require employees to sign so-called noncompete agreements, in which the worker agrees not to be hired by a competitor within a certain period of time. But California law generally regards such pacts as unenforceable, said Bob Taylor, a Palo Alto attorney who specializes in antitrust law, among other areas.</p>

<p>As a result, Taylor said, California &quot;is one of, if not the most, difficult states for employers to prevent employees from taking jobs with competitors.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a result, with the success of the Lille line, optical telegraph lines were built over the entirety of France over the next twenty years or so. Napoleon loved the system, having his own portable station built which he carried with him on campaign. He also poured money into building more of the network. It wasn&#039;t cheap, because each station had to be manned by a highly-trained person, who observed the signal from other towers and knew how to pass it on. But the French system of fast communication was one of the key ingredients in France&#039;s success during the Napoleonic War, and so they hung onto it as long as they could. Claude Chappe himself remained in his position as the head of the system for over 30 years, until there was an administration change.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">CLAUDE CHAPPE (1763-1805), French engineer, was born at Brulon (Sarthe) in 1763. He was the inventor of an optical telegraph which was widely used in France until it was superseded by the electric telegraph. His device consisted of an upright post, on the top of which was fastened a transverse bar, while at the ends of the latter two smaller arms moved on pivots. The position of these bars represented words or letters; and by means of machines placed at intervals such that each was distinctly visible from the next, messages could be conveyed through 50 leagues in a quarter of an hour. The machine was adopted by the Legislative Assembly in 1792, and in the following year Chappe was appointed ingenieur-telegraphe; but the originality of his invention was so much questioned that he was seized with melancholia and (it is said) committed suicide at Paris in 1805.

                <div class="delicious-extended">Buell&#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">The codes did not appear out of nowhere. Their immediate tributaries were nautical and coastal signal systems (typically involving flaghoist combinations), and visual telegraphs such as the Chappé optical telegraph system that operated across France from the mid-1790s well into the 1840s. With all of these systems, each sign or combination of signs represented a word or phrase in a code dictionary.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">It turned out that what I had instead was a commercial telegraphic code. From the 19th through the mid-20th centuries, telegrams were integral to business and personal communications. Telegraph codes proliferated as a way to correspond economically and privately. Readily available code books such as the ABC Universal Commercial Electric Telegraph Code, not to mention many others, were published, with many businesses creating in-house codes. According to telegraphy historian-enthusiast John McVey, “Thousands of codes were published or issued privately, but they are largely forgotten now. They present a finely-grained window into their respective domains and their time. And they provide instances of sometimes stunning visual, technical, lexicographic and unwitting poetic achievement.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Logan&#039;s alternative is nimbly and seductively argued. He shows a map in which the distribution of early settled societies throughout the temperate zone appears exactly to coincide with the geographical spread of the 400-odd species of oak. He cites many cultures - in north America, ancient Mesopotamia, the highlands of Mexico - where a style of living midway between nomadic gathering and rooted agriculture was evident long before the advent of cereal farming. You could, I suppose, call it fixed foraging, the communal exploitation of a long-lived local resource. The resource was the oak tree, always there in one form or another - just above the waterline, if you were fisher-people, just below the uplands if you were hunters. And its first and most fundamental gift was the acorn, prolific, nutritious (you just needed to leach out the tannin with water), storable, cookable.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">When all are done, get out your food grinder. Put a fine knife on the grinder and run the shelled acorns through it. This makes a coarse meal. Place this in a large crock or glass bowl. Then add boiling water to cover and let stand an hour. Drain and throw away the brownish, unappetizing water. Repeat. Then taste the meal. It should have a bit of a bitter tang, then taste sweet as you chew a piece. Continue leaching out the tannin as long as necessary.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">To get the tannic acid out of acorns, you need to leech them, that is stick them in boiling water for a few minutes, pour the water out, then repeat repeat repeat perhaps 25 times. Leeching is facilitated if you shell (obviously) the acorns and also chop them into fine pieces. Make sure to cut out any discolored or rotten portions of the nuts, and any grubs (unless you want to eat those too- I can vouch that they aren&#039;t poisonous but I don&#039;t know about the little cells that they build around themselves).</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">The reason I ask this: When I was a child, my grandfather had me pick up a small bucketful of acorns from under our pin oak tree. A day or two later, he asked me to come over to his house and he fed me acorns. The only problem I have is he never told anyone how in the world he prepared them.</p>

<p>Here is some information about eating acorns or rather acorn meal. The tannins have to be removed to avoid the bitterness. I don&#039;t know what your grandfather might have done to remove the tannins in whole acorns unless the type of acorn had less tannins to begin with and could have been removed by soaking the whole acorn.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">It’s a very complicated system. Oaks have “mast” cycles, which means that some years they produce tons of acorns and some years they produce few or none. Our oaks in Michigan do this as well. Mice eat acorns, and not surprisingly, in the New York study mouse numbers are linked to the mast cycles. More acorns, more white-footed mice.</div><br />

I’ve been excited to try them and found a recipe and changed it a little last night. The kids and I shaped the acorns, dipped the tops in chocolate, and then rolled them in ground walnuts. I added some finely ground coffee beans in with the walnuts for a coffee/walnut sort of flavor. The kids preferred their cookies just dipped in chocolate. If you have a nut allergy or just don’t like nuts you could try crushed cookies or something similar.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p><p>Kingsley Dennis and John Urry have a new book out, &ldquo;After The Car&rdquo;.&nbsp; I have a review copy on the way from the publisher; until it arrives, you can see the intro and the index from the Amazon link below.&nbsp; This is an oddly appropriate text to anticipate the week GM went bankrupt.</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Allow me for a brief moment to indulge. I would
like to inform you that my co-authored book titled &lsquo;After the Car&rsquo; has
now been published (finally!), and is currently sitting idly in Amazon.
See - <br>
<iframe marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=superpatron-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0745644228&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<br>Generally
the book is &lsquo;academic-ish&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m not expecting any of you to buy!
Although concerned with the car the book is also about the &lsquo;future&rsquo; and
addresses issues of a post peak-oil society. If you should feel so
inclined, or know of anyone who might be mildly interested, I would be
happy that you pass on the news. Below is the blurb:<br></div></p>

<p><br><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Product Description</strong><br> It is difficult to imagine a world
without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out
to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car
are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car
system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next
few decades. Specifically, the book examines how several major
processes are shaping the future of how we travel, including:<br>• Global warming and its many global consequences<br>• Peaking of oil supplies<br>• Increased digitisation of many aspects of economic and social life<br>• Massive global population increases<br></p>

<p>The
authors look at changes in technology, policy, economy and society, and
make a convincing argument for a future where, by necessity, the
present car system will be re–designed and re–engineered. Yet the
book also suggests that there are some hugely bleak dilemmas facing the
twenty first century. The authors lay out what they consider to be
possible ‘post–car’ future scenarios. These they describe as ‘local
sustainability’, ‘regional warlordism’ and ‘digital networks of
control’. <br><em>After The Car</em> will be of great interest to
planners, policy makers, social scientists, futurologists, those
working in industry, as well as general readers.<br>Some have
described the 20th Century as the century of the car. Now that century
has come to a close – and things are about to change. <br></div></p>

chronicles his experience with ALS (Lou Gehrig&#39;s Disease) and his
search for a treatment across six different countries. Winner of the
Jury Prize for Best Feature Documentary at the 2007 Cinequest Film
Festival, &quot;Indestructible&quot; provides an expansive portrait of the human
drama behind one of modern medicine’s greatest challenges. Following
the film, there will be a roundtable discussion on the state of
research on ALS with brief presentations by Eva Feldman, MD, Ph.D.,
Russell N. DeJong Professor of Neurology, Program for Neurology
Research &amp; Discovery, University of Michigan, and John McCarty,
Ph.D., Director, Therapeutic Investigations, ALS Therapy Development
Institute, with time for audience questions. &#0160;</span></font><br /><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12px;">

      </h3>
      <p>We haven&#39;t scheduled our visit yet to <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/">Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, MI</a>, but as a public service you should know that they are open.&#0160; From the mailing they sent out:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font color="#ff0000"><span class="il">STRAWBERRY</span> SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!!
</font></strong><br /><br />
The first day of the 2009 <span class="il">strawberry</span> season will be Wednesday June 3rd.
<br /><br />
As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&#0160;
ready to pick. If you are looking to pick massive amounts to freeze or
make jam it would be better to wait until they are more plentiful. With
the cool temperatures predicted the berries may not ripen that quickly.
It is advisable to call the farm before you come out to make sure we
are not closed to let them ripen up.
<br /><br />
The price of the berries is $1.46 per pound and we furnish the
containers for free.
<br /><br />
We are open 7 am to 8 pm daily (weather permitting).
<br /><br /></div><p>How did I find out about this, you ask?&#0160; &quot;The List&quot;</p><p class="UpickText blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We at Rowes have been compiling lists of customer
addresses over the years and been sending postcards to our customers
when the strawberry and raspberry seasons are at their peak. Our
strawberry list has over 12,000 addresses and the raspberry list has
over 4,500. Due to rising costs of printing and postage we are no
longer taking addresses for our lists. Instead we have started an email
list. You can sign up for &quot;The List&quot; by sending us an email via the <a href="http://rowesproducefarm.com/contact.html">Contact Us</a>
page. Once you send us an email the email address you send from will be
added to our new list. This way instead of getting one notice we are
able to send updated information on picking conditions more often,
better serving our customers. If you are on the &quot;old&quot; postcard list it
would be appreciated if you would sign up for the email list and tell
us your street address so we can remove it from the old list. </p><p>12000 strawberry pickers!&#0160; wow.&#0160; you should get on The List if you want more updates.&#0160; I didn&#39;t see any current info on their web site (other than &quot;get on The List&quot;).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.</p><p>Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in.&#0160; You are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat.&#0160; Each experience is essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less dingy, but it&#39;s all of a piece.</p><p>The result then is that I am transported into a new place with this effort, a place where I can write a postcard, read a long-forgotten book, or work within the confines&#0160;of my laptop without the infinite global distraction of the Internet.&#0160; Frankly, the infinite global distraction of the Internet is not conducive to reasonable thought - it demands attention, reply, responsiveness, and engagement, 24/7, whether you want it or not.</p><p>It&#39;s hard, but not impossible, to reconstruct airplane mode in the rest of the day.&#0160; The appropriate cafe can be a part of it, at least for the ritual coffee experience. It helps a lot to have a tool like Freedom (Mac OS X) that enforces a bit of network downtime for you by shutting down all Internet links for a period of time.&#0160; The telephone is&#0160;harder, but almost every call can be made to wait if you plan carefully enough to create a signal for what is actually urgent.</p><p>When I&#39;m offline, I write with different tools, and thus my thinking is different.&#0160; Entering text into &quot;vim&quot;, my old standby favorite text mode editor, triggers different brainwaves that does keying things carefully into a web form.&#0160; Not feeling like I have to hyperlink every third word frees up the brain for internal connections instead of external&#0160;connections.&#0160; There&#39;s rarely a need to hide from flashing distracting advertising or to spend time deleting spam.</p><p>Once upon a time, being online was the exception rather than the rule - some part of my far away brain remembers that and wants to get back to that earlier, simpler day.</p><p>--</p><p>notes afterwards.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/freedom-to-go-o.html">Freedom: previously described here.</a></p><p>a possible answer for using <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/06/use-notepad-vim-or-any-text-editor-with.html">vim as an alternative text editor in firefox</a></p><p>&quot;once upon a time&quot; is roughly the UUCP era, when there was email and netnews but no web and hardly ever any real time communications unless you were all logged into the same machine.</p>
