      <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5462">Robin Sloan on Snarkmarket</a> describing tools for large scale, real time collaboration, using Twitter, Google Forms, and Dropbox.  Jane McGonigal gets called out for noticing and naming three collaboration superpowers and the tools and attitudes and interpersonal skills that matter.  Note that these three are part of a list coming from a world of multiplayer gaming; if you were wondering why your CEO was spending time leveling up in some MMO, now you can see why:

<blockquote>
<strong>Mobbability</strong>: the ability to do real-time work in very large groups; a tal­ent for coordinating with many people simultaneously.
<strong>Cooperation radar</strong>: the ability to sense, almost intuitively, who would make the best collaborators on a particular task.
<strong>Ping quotient</strong>: measures your responsiveness to other people’s requests for engagement.
</blockquote>

      <p>is still worth fighting over, if you and your brother both want it.</p>

<p>What's the smallest piece of lego?</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35795&pid=625188&mode=threaded&start=">eurobricks forum</a> suggests it is a flower petal.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.</p><p>In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. &#0160;This blog has a &quot;garlic mustard&quot; tag, which signals that I should write about that at least once a year; without that reminder, somehow I might miss that opportunity to refresh that annual recipe opportunity. &#0160; The category list is long, but finite, and it&#39;s idiosyncratic to reflect some peculiar sense of evolved focus.</p><p>Tags are much harder, especially in a world of tags shared across a team. &#0160;There are enough variant spellings and punctuation in an 8000 unit tag cloud to make it tough to see which of those tags are most useful. &#0160;Perhaps I can carve out 20 or 30 to make my own, items to revisit repeatedly, but the system as a system does not constrain me as such.</p><p>It&#39;s very useful to have a bucket that can be usefully refilled periodically. &#0160;At the cycle of once per year, the cumulative knowledge of paczki rituals or cudighi recipes makes each successive year easier. &#0160;Monthly rituals leave room to breathe between attempts, and weekly cycles build up a substantial body of work in just a year. &#0160;</p><p>In many ways this is the mindless mindfulness approach to sustained productivity; don&#39;t decide what of 1000s of things you might do, simply have one picked for you and then go at it with a strict deadline to get you to where you need to go until the next time. &#0160;The effort can be impromptu and doesn&#39;t require much explicit preparation, since you&#39;ve primed the pump with previous work. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.</p>
<p>Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted.</p>
<p>Progress is a hard thing to measure with any degree of certainty. &#0160;&quot;Increase the n&quot; is one typical useful task, as though by heaping on one more of whatever it is that you are counting you can get one measure closer to ultimate success. &#0160;&quot;Decrease the n&quot; is the other task, which generally for me is the Sisyphian task of emptying the inbox or washing the dishes. &#0160;You&#39;re never really done, and the only progress you note is that something happened today.</p>
<p>The meaningless indicator of progress can simply be the recognition that you have hit some temporary and attainable local high point to the day, and that even if tomorrow brings you back to a spot where you need to do more, you at least did what you needed to do today. &#0160;Shining the sink is the domestic equivalent of inbox zero; yes, there still may be more to do tomorrow, but at least for today you&#39;re at the bottom of what needs to be done.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.</p>

<p>I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz. So off it goes, at least for now. Let Twitter be Twitter.</p>

<p>I suspect that blog-related stuff should land here, since there's at least some pretense that it should be longer. I almost wish there was a one-pass "post this to my blog too"; indeed, the first draft of this was written in Buzz, until I figured that it really should be posted to Vacuum and then pulled into Buzz through the feed. I guess. I hope that works.</p>

<p>It's always nice to try out some new communications system, especially one that makes you rethink your use of all of the old systems you had gotten out of the habit of using. I've also liked which random people from my address book that Google decided should be my first set of friends; they did a pretty good job.</p>

What swims before his prow, what swirls behind ---<br>
Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,<br>
Rains from the sky a meteoric shower<br>
Of facts . . . they lie unquestioned, uncombined.<br>
Wisdom enough to leech us of our ill<br>
Is daily spun; but there exists no loom<br>
To weave it into fabric; undefiled<br>
Proceeds pure Science, and has her say; but still<br>
Upon this world from the collective womb<br>
Is spewed all day the red triumphant child.<br>

<p></p><h4>THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO</h4><h5>How to Get Things Right</h5><p>Atul Gawande</p>

<p>Excerpt from Freakonomics review</p>
<blockquote>
Even more interesting are the stories about Walmart’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the real reason why David Lee Roth used to demand that there be a bowl of M&amp;M’s with all the brown ones removed in his dressing room backstage.</blockquote>

<p>Times Online <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article6995508.ece">review</a></p>

<blockquote>The surgeon-author was on the track of what might be described as a classic magic bullet — a low-tech way in a high-tech, expensive world in which lives might be saved and costs reduced. Gawande, using his own word, was searching for “eptitude” — the business of making sure that those with knowledge applied it effectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following checklist is designed to aid the checklist creation process and ensure that your checklist helps instead of hurts. &#0160;It was created by Dr. Atul Gawande, the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health Dissemination Team, and Dan Boorman of Boeing.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The nicest wiki implementation of checklists I&#39;ve seen is at Sunshine Review, using the MediaWiki dpl extension.</p>

<p>Another review, in <a href="https://www.indiacurrents.com/articles/2010/06/04/from-ignorance-to-ineptitude-to-eptitude">India Currents</a> 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But does novelty really matter when lives are at stake? In a
recent New York Times article about implementing checklists, Dr.
Peter Pronovost (whose contribution Gawande  acknowledges) exclaimed
that “You would have thought I started World War III.” He then
asserted that having nurses check to ensure that doctors washed
their hands has “gotten infection rates down to almost zero in the
ICU.” With success like that, patients are probably saying, “Thank
you very much, Dr. Gawande. Your manifesto may not be War and Peace,
but it has saved more lives than Tolstoy’s novel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pronovost is interviewed in a Wall Street Journal article,
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576131963185893084">The Secret to Fighting Infections</a>,
from 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pronovost&rsquo;s boyish appearance and enthusiastic manner belie a steely determination to challenge the status quo in medicine. He hasn&rsquo;t shied away from criticizing his peers for resisting safety and quality improvement efforts, a theme of his 2009 book &ldquo;Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals.&rdquo;</p>

      <p><span class="il">Networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span>: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, <strong>James Whitacre</strong> and <strong>Axel Bender</strong>, 2009/12/10, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1961">arXiv:0912.1961</a></p><blockquote><p>Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called <span class="il">networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span> hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.</p></blockquote><p>Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&#39;s my interpretation.&#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.</p><p>The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are <strong>flexible and reconfigurable</strong> (&quot;versatile&quot;).&#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.</p><p>The second note is the that the agents are <strong>diverse</strong> (oddly, in this language, &quot;degenerate&quot;) in their skills.&#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&#0160; </p><p>Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&#0160;&#0160; For any individual task, there&#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&#0160; </p><p>I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&#0160; I haven&#39;t even made sense yet of the &quot;network buffering&quot; piece.&#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.</p><p></p>

oil began to move and form thick ridges and thin troughs, a stage that
some recipes refer to as the oil “rippling.” As the temperature kept
climbing, the thin areas spread out and the ridges became fewer and
higher. The pattern reminded me of the long drops that run down the
inside of a glass of wine or spirits. Eventually the thin areas seemed
to run completely dry, and most of the oil had collected in a ring
around the pan edge. </p><p>With some research, I soon learned that I
had been observing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9nard_cells">Bénard-Marangoni convection</a>, which is related to
Marangoni convection in a wineglass. Uneven temperatures at the pan
surface cause regional differences in the oil’s surface tension, and
this causes the oil to get pulled toward the cooler areas.</p></blockquote>When the oil is at the right heat, pour in enough popping corn in the pan to make a layer of kernels a single kernel deep.&#0160;&#0160; Shake the pot around so that all of the kernels get a very thin coating of hot oil.&#0160; If there&#39;s any excess oil pooling around, you&#39;ve put<br />too much in.<br /><br />Put the pot back on the heat - again, it&#39;s 6/10 on our stove - and keep the lid in while it pops.&#0160; Shake the pan back and forth every so often.&#0160; When the popping stops, take the pan off the heat.<br /><br /><strong>Cinnamon Popcorn Cereal</strong><br /><br />a recipe from Jonathan<br /><br />Fresh popped popcorn<br />Cinnamon<br />Milk<br /><br />Pour fresh popped popcorn in a bowl.&#0160; Sprinkle cinnamon on top.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2009/2009-11-10-ypsilanti-michigan-to-adopt-more-stringent-open-meetings-act-rules/">Ypsilanti, Michigan to adopt more stringent Open Meetings Act rules</a>
      </h3>
      YPSILANTI - A very straightforward yet revolutionary approach to open meetings in Ypsilanti says that every subcommittee of City Council must abide by the Michigan Open Meetings Act - including providing advance notice of meetings - just in case enough council members show up to form a quorum.<p><a href="http://ypsiciti.com/section/News/Ypsi+broadens+scope+of+Open+Meetings+Act-article-1325.html">Ypsilanti Citizen story</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The OMA resolution, which was added to council’s agenda at 5 p.m. on
Oct. 20, was discussed in relation to the approval of the Ypsilanti
Downtown Development Authority bylaws - a separate agenda item at the
meeting. </p><p>Murdock said the resolution is simply about “having meetings where decisions are made open to the public.” </p><p>Although
he had previous discussions with City Manager Ed Koryzno during
Council’s goal-setting sessions in January, Murdock moved forward with
the resolution Oct. 20, when the DDA violated the Open Meetings Act
earlier in the month by having a quorum, or more than seven members of
the board, participate at a planning committee meeting. </p></blockquote><p>the <a href="http://advanceypsilanti.com/?p=655">Advance Ypsilanti PAC</a> notes that the resolution snuck in at the last possible minute</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sadly, the process by which this open meetings resolution
was enacted is exactly the opposite of an open process. This is not
just ironic, but suspect.</strong></p><p>For instance, consider that this resolution was sent to the city
clerk and posted to the council packets at 4:16 p.m. the day of the
city council meeting, <em><strong>less than 3 hours </strong></em>before
council was to convene. AY PAC asks ‘why’? There was no emergency, no
timeline that needed to be met on this issue. There was no pressing
need that forced this to be addressed and resolved THAT NIGHT.</p><p>If anyone can inform AY PAC as to why this was so urgent that it
needed to be addressed in a timeline that included NO opportunity for
public comment and little reflection by council, we welcome the
information.</p></blockquote><p>The back story is the Ypsi DDA meeting in October 2008 which was held in closed session, in evident violation of the Open Meetings Act.&#0160; <a href="http://ypsinews.com/index.php/200810-ypsilanti-dda-violates-open-meetings-act-twice-in-one-meeting/comment-page-1/">From YpsiNews (Steve Pierce) at the time:</a></p><blockquote><p>(October 7, 2008) During a meeting of the <a href="http://www.ypsilantidda.org/" target="_blank">Ypsilanti Downtown Development</a>, the DDA board violated not one, but two sections of the Open Meetings Act.</p><p>The Director of the Ypsilanti DDA, Brian Vosburg, called an
emergency closed session meeting to be held on Friday, October 3, 2008
at 12 noon. The purpose of the meeting was to meet with DDA attorney
Tammie Tischler. </p><p>The DDA Director said in the meeting notice the “Closed Session (is)
to consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure by state or
federal statute - (Open Meetings Act 15.268, Section 8(h))”</p><p>However, neither the DDA Director nor the DDA attorney would cite
which state or federal statute exempts the DDA from the Open Meetings
Act. Failing to publicly state the reason for a closed session is a
violation of the Open Meetings Act.</p></blockquote><p></p>

      </h3>
      There&#39;s a wide variety of quality in people&#39;s ability to express themselves in written form, and an &quot;email interview&quot; is one way of assessing this.&#0160; This generally takes the form of a set of questions provided to the interviewee to be answered by them using whatever means they have to prepare a suitable answer.&#0160; You will often find that it takes some time to get a response back, especially if there are a lot of questions or if the questions are hard.<br /><br />Frankly, I&#39;m disappointed that more people don&#39;t spend the time on getting better at both writing written questions and in responding to them.&#0160; A well-written set of questions, thought through in advance, can give a candidate or any other interview subject time to prepare and reflect on the tone they wish to project.&#0160; This can be very instructive when compared to the same person&#39;s behavior in an unreflective, spontaneous, unscripted moment.&#0160; In addition, email leaves a trail and a public record and you know how useful it is to have a public record to refer to from time to time rather than private, unreliable personal notes.<br /><br />I know that the stereotype is the ink-stained reporter clutching the steno pad grabbing a good phrase here and there.&#0160; But there needs to be more attention to how people present themselves in email, especially given how much municipal business is transacted through the email.&#0160; I am certain that a reporter is capable of being just as tough and as hard-nosed via written form to members of government and candidates for elected office - just as good elected officials are skilled in the art of writing pointed requests for information from agencies and departments in order to get at the details they want.

      <p>http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/decline.txt</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">In this book, Gregory Feist reviews and consolidates the scattered
literatures on the psychology of science, then calls for the
establishment of the field as a unique discipline. He offers the most
comprehensive perspective yet on how science came to be possible in our
species and on the important role of psychological forces in an
individual’s development of scientific interest, talent, and
creativity. Without a psychological perspective, Feist argues, we
cannot fully understand the development of scientific thinking or
scientific genius.</p><p>say something about Manfred Kochen and the slow accumulation of intellectual debts reflected in bibliographies</p>

Age 79, died September 23 2009. Born on July 10, 1930 in Detroit, MI
the only child of Albert Frank Aberdeen and Leona Winifred Cozzens
Aberdeen. In 1961, David married Virginia Ray Ackley of Oakdale
California. They were married 36 years when she predeceased him in
1997. Together they had two sons, David Hall and John Stuart. David
spent his first 8 years in Detroit before moving to Portage Lake, where
he graduated from Pinckney High School in 1948. He attended Albion
College in his freshman year before transferring to the University of
Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1952 and then
earned a Masters degree in education from the University of Michigan in
1954. He began his long public school career in Chicago, where he
taught elementary school for five years, as well as night classes in
English as a Second Language. He then returned to Ann Arbor where he
would spend the rest of his professional career working for the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann%20Arbor%20Public%20Schools">Ann
Arbor Public Schools</a>. He worked first as an elementary school teacher
and later as an administrator, at different times serving as Deputy
Superintendent and principal of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Thurston_Elementary_School">Thurston</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Burns_Park_Elementary_School">Burns Park</a> elementary
schools. An early advocate of equal opportunity for all students, he
spent a year with the Mott Foundation in Flint, after which he obtained
his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1969. After retiring from
Burns Park in 1988, he continued to work for the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Administrators_Association">Ann Arbor
Administrators Association</a> until earlier this year. He also served on
the board of the Pinckey Community Schools Alumni Association, chairing
the scholarship committee. He chose the perfect profession as it
allowed him to express his lifelong passion for teaching and learning.
In 1988 the Michigan State Senate passed a concurrent resolution (No.
672) offering tribute to honor David&#39;s contributions to public
education. Along with his family, his other great loves were music,
literature and the arts. Possessing an uncanny ability to remember the
lyrics to any song he was unbeatable at &quot;Name that Tune&quot;. His love of
words was reflected in his unique writings, his large collection of
books and his ability to quote from almost any poem, book or movie.
David was never a stranger in any group - if he met you, he was your
friend. He is survived by his two sons, David Hall Aberdeen of San
Francisco California, and John Stuart Aberdeen of Arlington
Massachusetts, and a host of friends, colleagues and former students. A
memorial will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday, October 3rd, in the Ballroom
of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_League">Michigan League</a>, 911 N. University Avenue in Ann Arbor. David
was a lifelong advocate of public education and to honor him donations
in his memory may be made to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/AAPSEF">Ann Arbor Public Schools Educational
Foundation</a> (<a href="http://aapsef.org/">http://aapsef.org/</a>)

      </h3>
      <p>The basic idea is from Martha Rose &quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&quot; 1986, p. 103.&#0160; It&#39;s very simple, as befits her normal cooking.&#0160; Cut the tops from peppers, clean them out, fill with a mix of leftover rice and beans and top with cheese.&#0160; Bake 30 to 40 minutes, as long as it takes for things to get as soft as you want.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll end up using black beans; there&#39;s rice from yesterday.&#0160; We have an abundance of tomatoes from market, since it&#39;s the season when you order a half a peck they are SO HAPPY that someone wants their roma tomatoes in quantity that you end up with an extra pint of cherry tomatoes just to taste.&#0160; The 4 y/o will want the beans plain.</p><p>Cook all the peppers in the fridge, there will be more on Saturday. The freeze watch line is as far south as Gaylord, so we should be good for a few more weeks.<br /><p class="asset asset-image"><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Frz_plt-Sep-28" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-800wi" title="Frz_plt-Sep-28" /></a>

We are proud to be starting our 14th year of SMP on October 3rd and are very grateful to our speakers and our audience for their time and enthusiasm, which has made SMP so successful.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; ">&#0160;</span></p><p><span style="color: black; ">The lectures are held in 170 Dennison on the U-M central campus (Ann Arbor) from 10:30 to 11:30 am on Saturday mornings and are preceded by refreshments and followed by question-and-answer sessions. Parking is available at the Church Street structure at a cost of $2.00 per vehicle.<br /><br /></span></p><p><span style="color: black; ">Since 1995, the easily understood, informal lectures of Saturday Morning Physics have provided their audiences with an enjoyable understanding of physics and a broad reach into recent discoveries in modern science. The lectures have been supported by the generous contributions of individual donors. The Fall series is sponsored by gifts made by friends of the program, and in part, through endowments made in honor of Dr. M. Lois Tiffany and Mrs. Hideko Tomozawa. In order to continue professional videotaping of the series, we depend on contributions from individuals. We invite each of you to become a sponsor of these lectures with a tax-deductible donation.<strong>Please make a contribution so that we can continue this great program.<br /><br /></strong></span></p><p><span style="color: black; ">We are continuing to provide an opportunity for you to contribute by reserving&#0160;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a pair</span></strong>&#0160;of seats of your choice; $350.00 will hold your chosen seats for the entire Fall series and $550.00 for both the Fall and Winter series. A donation of $2,900 underwrites the cost of producing an entire SMP lecture and will enable us to offer more talks each semester. For more information and to choose your seats or sponsor a lecture, please see a Physics staff member at the entrance to 170 Dennison before or after any of the lectures, or send us an e-mail at<a href="mailto:umsmp@umich.edu" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">umsmp@umich.edu</a>.</span></p><p><span style="color: black; ">&#0160;</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: black; ">DATES:</span></span><span style="color: black; ">&#0160;<span>&#0160;</span><strong>October 3, 10, 17, 24, 31; November 7, 14, 21</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">&#0160;</span></p><p style="background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: #bfbfbf; background-position: initial initial; "><a name="123e6f4333aae0b3_OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="123e6f4333aae0b3_OLE_LINK2"><strong><span style="color: #0070c0; ">October 3</span></strong><span style="color: red; "><br /></span><strong><span style="color: #333333; ">Professor Dante Amidei, U-M Physics</span></strong></a><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #333333; "><br /></span><strong><em>Mirrors, Anti-Matter, and the Left-Handed World</em></strong><span style="color: #333333; "></span></p><p style="background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: #bfbfbf; background-position: initial initial; ">Can you know whether you are looking at the world or its mirror reflection?

In the absence of Ro, <em>Prp</em><sup> </sup>is responsible for medium-<strong><font color="#cc0000" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: #cc0000; -moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-origin: padding; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">purple</font></strong> pod when homozygous and light-<strong><font color="#cc0000" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: #cc0000; -moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-origin: padding; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">purple</font></strong><sup> </sup>pods in combination with the other alleles. The alleles <em>prp<sup>sh2</sup></em><sup> </sup>and <em>prp<sup>sh</sup></em> give green pods shaded with <strong><font color="#cc0000" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: #cc0000; -moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-origin: padding; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">purple</font></strong> and are codominant<sup> </sup>with the <em>prp<sup>st</sup></em> allele, which causes green pods to be striped<sup> </sup>with <strong><font color="#cc0000" style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: #cc0000; -moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-origin: padding; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;">purple</font></strong>. These four alleles are dominant for pod color over<sup> </sup><em>prp</em>, an allele causing green pods when homozygous. The interaction<sup> </sup>of these alleles with the genes <em>Gri, V</em>, and <em>Ro</em>, which also affect<sup> </sup>anthocyanin pigmentation of corolla and pod, is described. No<sup> </sup>linkages among these four loci were observed.<br /><br /></div><p>That&#39;s from 1984; I don&#39;t know enough about bean genetics to go any further.</p><p>(Oh, and they are delicious.)<br /><nobr><br /></nobr><strong><nobr></nobr></strong></p>
