        <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of Global Tuners. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).
First, you'll need a Global Tuners account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-listening-to-baseball-online-with-global-tuners-radio/">&raquo;</a></p>

So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there.

        <p>I don't know what other people's experiences are, but increasingly I'm finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone's wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.
The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-08-using-my-phone-more-and-more-as-a-wireless-hotspot-in-cafes/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A note from Steve Pierce regarding a request for ideas and code to help people log into a free WiFi mesh network. Contact him for details at bottom.
 HDL.com and volunteers have deployed a free WiFi network in SE Michigan over the last 5 years. With over 1,000 access points deployed and 650,000 unique devices connected, Wireless Ypsi and companion networks such as Detroit Enabled are averaging over 2,500 users per day, making it one of the largest free WiFi networks in the country. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-26-need-a-login-and-registration-system-for-a-free-wifi-network-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm listening to the Tuolumne County Sheriff, Fire, and Police scanner feed via Broadcastify. The scanner chatter includes the usual traffic reports but also the distinctive cadence of firefighting operations - calls for "Charlies" (?), water tenders, and other fire equipment, and a fire coordinator asking a crew leader what additional resources they need.
This webcam photo from within Yosemite shows the intense smoke that characterizes this fire. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-25-listening-to-the-yosemite-rim-fire/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.
Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.
It's worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-25-winding-down-the-summer/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Two reports of a fire on the 900 block of Mary Street on Saturday at around 3:00 a.m. The sirens woke me up.
The AnnArbor.com story notes that a 3 car garage was destroyed and gives the "we don't know very much" report:
 The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.
 The Michigan Daily story gives more details, including a photo from neighbor Raymond Brokowski, and has this disturbing detail: it's being investigated as arson. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-25-arson-on-mary-street-the-michigan-daily-is-on-it-the-annarborcom-not-so-much/">&raquo;</a></p>

Prime Red is also known as Akane or Tokyo Rose. From Orange Pippin, an encyclopedia of apples:
 Akane was developed in Japan in the 1930s, and represents an unusual marriage of the classic English early variety, Worcester Pearmain, and the high quality American heritage apple variety, Jonathan - and it is a marriage that works very successfully. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-24-prime-red-apples-are-in-at-farmers-market-august-24-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn't have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.

        <p>I'm still reading the darned thing, and sometimes I click on the links. But for now, at least, I'm taking a vow of silence on Facebook. No poking people, no one-click birthday wishes, and no back-and-forth banter punctuated by screen refreshes hoping that there's something else of interest to look at.
I like you all out there in Facebook land, but something has to give, and I'd rather be an old-school blogger that still puts out a post or two a week than an ace Facebook user with little to show for it after years of work except calluses on my fingers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-21-taking-a-vow-of-silence-on-facebook/">&raquo;</a></p>
