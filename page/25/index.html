<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-03-a-localwiki-for-the-marquette-michigan-area/">A localwiki for the Marquette, Michigan area</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There's no better way to learn about your home town than by trying to start a wiki for it. In that regard, I'm happy to announce a new <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/">Localwiki installation for Marquette County, Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> crew has developed a new hosting platform for people who want to start a wiki for their area, but who don't have the resources or the time or the skills to launch their own server. It runs on <a href="http://localwiki.net">Localwiki.net</a>, and currently has about two dozen sites up and running. Your town or region could be next!</p>

<p>When I originally envisioned doing a wiki for Marquette, I was thinking ambitiously and thought "hey, I'll do the whole U.P." I'm glad I didn't, not at least yet. There's enough small amounts of nitty-gritty detail about local history, ghost towns, old mines, and bits of industrial archaeology that I have just enough knowledge to tackle for the Marquette area, but don't have any clue where I'd start for Houghton or Escanaba or the Soo. Someone else can tackle that.</p>

<p>Marquette County is the biggest county (by area) in Michigan, so there's plenty of geography to cover. It's also home to some political subdivisions like <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Humboldt_Township">Humboldt Township</a> that have less than 500 inhabitants, no post office of their own, and no chance ever that anyone there would start a wiki just for that place alone.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a>, which covers Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County, I see this as the very first step towards a project that could last a long time. At a few pages a day for a few years you could start to get to the point where you had enough material to be useful for a visitor, a local, or a historian, and where people who would never be notable enough for a first draft biography on Wikipedia might get properly noted or memorialized. I'm looking forward to learning more so that the next time I visit I'll be that much better informed.</p>

<p>I'm starting to use <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">MedHelper</a> for Android as a tool to keep track of my medicine. As you get older, it's more and more likely that you'll be on some medication, and since I've had side effects from previous meds I'm happy to find something that helps me track things.</p>

<p>It's a relatively complicated program compared to some simple pill reminder apps on the market, but my use is relatively simple. There's a reminder function to alert you when it's time to take your medicine, a log that tracks when you actually did take your meds, and a simple comment log that lets you add notes about how it's going or any side effects you noticed. If you're doing detailed logging of weight, blood pressure, or a number of other vital signs there's a place for that.</p>

<p>At the moment there's no web-based version of it, but the site hints at a "cloud" version, which I suppose I'd welcome.</p>

<p>The test of any software like this is twofold. First, does it help you actually follow your prescription better than a simple alarm or a pillbox. Second, does it help you when you are at the doctor's office talking about your health. I haven't tested either, but I'm looking forward to updating this review when I get a few months of actual use in place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Originally seen on <a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/">Deadline Detroit</a>, my go-to place for quick hits on Detroit news - the <a href="http://metrotimes.com/">Metro Times</a> is up for sale. If you ever wanted to be in journalism now's your chance.</p>

<p><a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/articles/6165/for_sale_the_metro_times">From the article</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company that owns the Metro Times told its Detroit staff this morning (August 26, 2013) the paper is for sale, throwing the future of the 33-year-old alternative weekly into doubt at a time of great uncertainty for print publications.</p>
  
  <p>Few details were available; employees were told not to speak to the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was noted (and I can't recall where, sorry) that there is no independent library that has a full run of the Metro Times archived, and there's a reasonable concern that if the Metro Times morgue is sold along with the paper that a big piece of Detroit music history could be lost.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A note from Steve Pierce regarding a request for ideas and code to help people log into a free WiFi mesh network. Contact him for details at bottom.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://hdl.com">HDL.com</a> and volunteers have deployed a free WiFi network in SE Michigan over the last 5 years. With over 1,000 access points deployed and 650,000 unique devices connected, <a href="http://wireless.ypsi.com">Wireless Ypsi</a> and companion networks such as <a href="http://detroitenabled.org/">Detroit Enabled</a> are averaging over 2,500 users per day, making it one of the largest free WiFi networks in the country.</p>

<p>The equipment and connections are paid for by local community groups like Focus Hope and Public Housing along with business owners and community champions. No money is charged to use the WiFi service, nor is there any advertising revenue. </p>

<p>The free network, called Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled is HDL.com’s way of giving back to the community. We help secure Internet bandwidth and donate time and equipment to support the free network.</p>

<p>The struggle we face is making sure we comply with Internet Service providers terms of service agreements. One recent requirement is to not have anonymous access to the network. While we would love to have open and free Internet for everyone, the reality is Internet service costs money and the major carriers like Comcast and AT&amp;T don’t provide the service for free. So while Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled offer free WiFi for residents, business and visitors, someone still needs to pay for the connections.</p>

<p>To continue to use these paid connections we need a system that will allow people to sign up for free accounts to use the service. We want something akin to Facebook or Twitter that will allow for instant sign up and use of the free WiFi network.</p>

<p>Users would provide their name, address, phone and email address and chose a secure password. They would immediately be granted access to the network for one day. A confirmation email link is sent to the email address and it must be confirmed to continue to use the service beyond the first day.</p>

<p>Authentication would use a RADIUS server or similar service which would need to be selected, as well. We must insure proper data security and programming techniques are used to protect the data.</p>

<p>Not having a login and registration system is the single largest barrier we face today to continued large scale deployments of free WiFi. We have proven with our 5 year success story that the network is reliable and sustainable. Yet not having a login and registration system has virtually stopped us from expanding services into new areas until we can address this need.</p>

<p>Much more information about the Rim Fire, including maps, is available through <a href="http://inciweb.org/incident/3660/">InciWeb</a> system. The August 25 update reads as follows:</p>

<p>&gt; The Rim Fire continues to burn on the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park, Bureau of Land Management and State responsibility land. The fire is exhibiting continued growth to the northeast and east. On the western side of the fire, crews successfully conducted firing operations to bring the fire line down to the Tuolumne River in efforts to keep the fire from spreading to the west toward the Highway 108 corridor. Aerial resources continue to be effective in reducing the spread of fire toward the Highway 108 corridor. Crews continue to construct line construction where accessibility and safety allows. In addition, structure defense and contingency planning continues in the Mather area.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 23, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18169">declared a state of emergency</a> for San Francisco, noting that the fire threatens both power and water resources for the city.</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the wildfires that started in Tuolumne County have caused damage to electrical infrastructure serving the City and County of San Francisco, and now threaten damage to property, equipment, and resources of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department; and</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been forced to shut down transmission lines with the result that the City and County is affected by the wildfires in the County of Tuolumne and is likely to be further affected should the fire cause additional damage to the City and County of San Francisco’s water and electrical assets in Tuolumne County, including the possible temporary interruption of electricity and/or water delivery;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.</p>

<p>Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.</p>

<p>It's worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time. Fortunately both boys are self-propelled on bicycles to get to school.</p>

<p>Apples are back in season, after a full year last year without them. The reports from market suggest that the crop is going to be a good one.</p>

<p>Football parking is back on the agenda - football itself, not so much, but the crowds that come with games can mean a juicy allowance for the intrepid soul who has a front yard and a driveway with extra spaces for cars.</p>

<p>There's a tally of the things that didn't get done this summer. Strawberry picking didn't happen (papa had a bad morning), and blueberry picking didn't work out that well (the youngest couldn't reach the high bush berries). I'm hoping that our Ypsilanti raspberry patch will be free from the fly infestation (spotted wing Drosophila) that has wiped out several other berrypicking locations nearby.</p>

<p>Farmers Market is always worth going to this time of year. Late summer suppers with green beans, tomatoes, and corn are a joy.</p>

      <p>Two reports of a fire on the 900 block of Mary Street on Saturday at around 3:00 a.m. The sirens woke me up.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/garage-fire-on-mary-street-threatens-nearby-homes/">AnnArbor.com story</a> notes that a 3 car garage was destroyed and gives the "we don't know very much" report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://michigandaily.com/blog/wire/police-investigating-fire-mary-street">Michigan Daily story</a> gives more details, including a photo from neighbor Raymond Brokowski, and has this disturbing detail: it's being investigated as arson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals were seen running from the scene. The <a href="http://police.umich.edu/?posting_id=299">crime alert</a> describes them as 5’11” to 6’0”, wearing dark hooded sweatshirts and blue jeans. No further description is given.</p>

<p>UPDATE Monday: The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/crime/2-men-suspected-of-lighting-fire-that-destroyed-ann-arbor-garage/">followup AnnArbor.com story</a> has more details, at least a little; it took them a full two and a half days from the time that the incident occurred until they ran the followup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ann Arbor police Lt. Renee Bush said police and fire personnel were sent at 3:20 a.m. Saturday to an alley behind the 600 block of Packard Street for a report of a fire. Bush said the resident of a home in the 900 block of Mary Street, who reported the incident, saw a fire in a recycling container full of cardboard.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It wasn't completely internet-free, because there was wifi at my Mom's place and wifi at McDonald's for the occasional stops and wifi at the very nice Dead River Cafe in Marquette. But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn't have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places I would have liked to have captured in the moment while I was there with a camera and with Twitter to share them. For example, there's the cutest little gazebo-like structure on the Iron Ore Heritage Trail underneath the LS&amp;I railroad trestle. It's cute until you realize that it's there to deflect the ore pellets off the trail and off of the heads of passing bicyclists as they go under an active set of tracks.</p>

<p>I also missed there being a local wiki to look things up in (and to add my own commentary to) for the Upper Peninsula, along the lines of Ann Arbor's Arborwiki. There's a lot of history in the area that's still relatively unwritten, and it would have been fantastic to have a place to store bits of commentary and observations without necessarily broadcasting a stream of social media to my long-suffering friends.</p>

<p>I'm back, not having missed Facebook much at all, and not having been tethered to a Twitter update stream, and only 100 messages behind in my inbox.</p>

  <p>The 4,000 job cuts that Cisco Systems announced Wednesday are the latest in several major staff reductions by the San Jose networking company. Others include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>July 2012: 1,300 jobs, about 2 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>July 2011: 6,500 jobs, 4,400 through layoffs and 2,100 through early retirement packages, representing 9 percent of its global workforce</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Ten years ago, the power went out.</p>

<p>It's not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it's just you or if it's happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called <a href="http://forkestra.com/">Dave Langhorst</a>, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/power_outage.html">2003 blackout</a> here on Vacuum, and the day after, I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/network_down_re.html">asked if people had good fiction</a> to share about end-of-the-world scenarios that involved not fire or ice but network downtime. E. M. Forster's <a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a> was the universal recommendation; I recommend it to you as well as a short story from more than 100 years ago about the death of the net as we know it.</p>

      <p>I have a feeling that I'm going to be doing a lot more writing using the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown
is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/using_markdown.html">supported by Typepad</a>, <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">supported by Octopress</a> (with a bunch of enhancements), <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">supported by Github</a> (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), <a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">supported by Vim</a> (with colorizing of text),
and <a href="https://leanpub.com/help/manual">supported by Leanpub</a> (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files). That's five
for five for the environments I'm working in the most, which suggests that it's
worthwhile to learn all that I can.</p>

<p>Markdown is a fairly simple language, and it's relatively old in net terms (2004)
so it's had time to mature. Maturing means both that there are well-documented
core features that are invariant among all Markdown interpreters, as well as 
sometimes incompatible details that show up when people extend the system.</p>

      <p>Setting up <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has given me a chance to look through some of
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti">my old Github repositories</a> and re-assess what's there and how to 
improve on them. </p>

<p>This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it
reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a
github account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/aadl-amazon-linky">aadl-amazon-linky</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">superpatron</a>. Both of these are interfaces
to the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> catalog, which has a very accessible
programming interface with things like RSS feeds for catalog searches.
I'd like to go back and revisit two parts of this. One was a Greasemonkey
plugin to put library results in Amazon; that should be a Chrome plugin.
The second was a "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/79567788/">wall of books</a>" report displaying an RSS query as a
page full of book cover images. Of the two, the second looks easiest to
recreate; I just checked in some new code, <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/superpatron/blob/master/tools/wall-by-keyword.sh">wall by keyword</a>, which does
the trick.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools">vielmetti-shelltools</a>. This is a small collection of shell scripts
that I carry around with me and put on whatever system I happen to be
working on. It would be worthwhile to go back through and compare
what I used then with what I use now and refresh the collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">postcard</a>. This was a hopeful project to use various web-to-postcard
APIs to generate custom postcards on the fly from the command line. Alas,
several of those APIs have disappeared. The real action in this market is
sending a real postcard from your iPhone or Android phone, with products
like <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a> leading the way. The other neat feature is to go to a drugstore
and make an instant print, then stick a stamp on the back and mail it.
(<a href="http://communitynetworking2008.wordpress.com/">Steve Cisler</a> taught me that trick.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter-mutual-friends</a>. Once upon a time, the Twitter API was so
simple that you could write a useful application in four lines of shell
script. Now the API has improved itself, and it's gotten a lot more 
complicated. Look at simple apps like <a href="https://github.com/gianu/latest_tweets">latest_tweets</a> by gianu to
get an idea of what you're up against now.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">mobile</a>. Again, once upon a time, I had a Blackberry phone which
had the world's worst usable web browser. Fortunately there were enough
web sites that had a minimalist presentation that I was able to put
together a directory of workable sites, which I used for quite a while.
Now I have an Android phone that runs Chrome as well as apps and I don't
need the list of sites quite so much; still, it's worthwhile to have
a place to collect them when I find them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So when it's time to write some code here are some ideas for where
to start again!</p>

A third pedestrian, wearing a pink t-shirt, helped get our bike off of us and handed me my partners glasses. I&#39;m sure he also witnessed the incident, and saw the vehicle leave the scene. </p>
<p>If you, or anyone you&#39;ve spoke to had told you about this accident, or have pics/video if the incident, please contact me through this post. It can be done anonymously, we are looking for the driver of the vehicle who left the scene. Also, I&#39;d like to thank the pedestrians, Ypsi firefighters, the fine paramedics of HVA, and Officer Thompson of Ypsi PD for all your help.

      </h3>
      <p>I am using Octopress to build a new web site at <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io">http://vielmetti.github.io</a>. This looks like it will be a good place as any to write about code and any github projects I am working on. I will keep writing about everything else here.</p>

<p>To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown. Then you use a command line tool called 'rake', the Ruby version of 'make', to do the publishing. Files that have changed get checked in to github. Then the whole site is put into static files, so that it all loads fast.</p>

<p>Amazing how much more time you have for hacking when you are not on Facebook.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Several reasons why I am removing the Facebook from my phone.</p>

<p>Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</p>

<p>Facebook's ads are increasingly intrusive. It is easier to cope with the ads on Twitter.</p>

<p>It is easy to switch identity on the Twitter client so if I temporarily need to take the voice of Arborwiki or of Heikki Lunta it is easy. With Facebook I am expected to be me all the time.</p>

<p>The mobile Android Facebook client is bad at reminders of birthdays, so to do that I need to go to the desktop client anyways.</p>

<p>Time on Facebook generally is time away from blogging. True, the blog has fewer readers and less comments then an equal post on Facebook, but I am not writing this strictly to chase feedback.</p>

<p>It is always worthwhile to experiment with change, especially since it would be easy to change back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997">from the Ann Arbor District Library.</a></p>

<p>Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</p>

<p>Grant likes givers, but recognizes that sometimes people give too much and never manage to get things in return. These selfless people tend to burn out when too many things go opposite to their interests. He opens up the opportunity to recognize a newly coined word "otherish" - an opposite of selfish where you consider both your interests and the others interests simultaneously. "Otherish" people are looking for win-win situations, as opposed to selfless people who end up in win-lose setups.</p>

<p>"Givers are overrepresented at the top, as well as at the bottom, of most success measures." </p>

<p>An <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/printer_friendly.cfm?articleid=3224">interview with Adam Grant</a> about the book is a 25 minute version which touches on several more high points of the book.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. That candidate who will go unnamed was said to have been very upset about losing, and their supporters were said to have been rude to the press and to other politicos present. I wasn't there to witness it myself.</p>

<p>Remind me never to run for public office.</p>
