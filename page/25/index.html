<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.</p>
<p>Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home. Some stayed in Marquette, or came back after college, or moved to even smaller towns nearby.</p>
<p>Ask about their family, and you will find that some of your classmates are grandparents.</p>
<p>Ask about what they are doing. &#0160;I was surprised to find some of my classmates having had 25 or even 30 years of continuous career in the same field or even with the same employer.</p>
<p>I found myself mostly talking to people who I talked to in high school - as my friend Tim put it we found the &quot;geek table&quot; and occupied that. Some things never change, and all we would have needed was a Rubik&#39;s Cube and we could pick up where we left off.</p>
<p>People do change a lot in 30 years. A small handful of folks look remarkably like what they looked like 30 years ago, plus or minus an 80s hairdo. Others changed a lot, not always in a direction I would have expected.</p>
<p>There was a small shrine to the classmates who had died, and it was sad and surprising to see young faces and realize that you wouldn&#39;t be seeing them again, not here and not anywhere.</p>
<p>All in all, it was one of those parties that reminded me of the very few high school parties I went to - lots of people standing around drinking beer, a few people dancing, and the DJ playing the B-52s. I&#39;m looking forward to the next event some 5 or 10 years from now to see how we&#39;re still all holding up.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-08-how-did-i-meet-you-how-do-i-know-you/">How did I meet you? How do I know you?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.</p>
<p>The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. If I can hit each of those three perspectives on a relationship, chances are that it&#39;s easy to start up a new conversation and easy to call someone to mind when it&#39;s time to make a new introduction.</p>
<p>Alas, most personal address book software does a lousy job of keeping tabs on any of this. You can add a &quot;related to&quot; field in some systems, but that&#39;s not something that I&#39;ve seen pulled out and turned into a full featured exploring tool. If you&#39;re lucky you get to enter some free text in some notes field, but even then you might not get the ability to search it on the fly. And heaven help you if you want to tag or group or categorize or classify people (for your own memory purposes) without fighting a system that generally is indifferent to the idea that people might belong to more than one group.</p>
<p>If I can dream, I&#39;d like the simple app - perhaps just a thin front end to my address book - that flashes names in front of me and helps me quickly remember who&#39;s who and how I might know them. This is multiply true right now because I have a lot of dormant connections to people that I&#39;d like to refresh. A smart address book, or a routine way of collecting that information in a dumb address book, should be able to help that process out.</p>
<p>UPDATE: It turns out that one of the recent updates to LinkedIn adds a &quot;how did I meet you&quot; question, with the ability to link to a person as the introducer. It&#39;s a good start.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-04-some-notes-from-a-lunchtime-talk-on-social-media/">Some notes from a lunchtime talk on social media</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A few highlights, not the whole talk.</p>
<p>My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.</p>
<p>For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;followers&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</p>
<p>Regarding frequency, the notion is that communications media have a natural rhythm, and that you need to be aware of how often you post or comment so that you don&#39;t either overrun the medium or be so quiet as to be unnoticed.</p>
<p>Finally mobility is the observation that more and more people are coming to the net primarily through mobile devices and if you want to serve them you need to have a solution for your web and net presence that looks good on the small screen.</p>
<p>I was greeted with a fair degree of skepticism about the value of social media for business, especially from someone who cancelled his Facebook account and never has been on Twitter. There was good discussion of how hard it is to simultaneously be brand-conscious and be aware of a professional persona vs. sharing details of a personal life. I think it&#39;s harder for people in an agency role whose job it is to make the client look good but who don&#39;t have to have a personal public identity in order to do their work.</p>
<p>Some day when I retire I&#39;ll give up on social media entirely and just send postcards to people - they are novel compared to the communciations that people mostly get, they&#39;re quite portable and mobile, no one expects a frequency of a postcard more than once in a long while, and if you send postcards you&#39;re likely to get postcards in return.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.</p>
<p>I'm going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me.</p>
<p>1. Gmail is getting a new user interface, one that adds tabs and more integration with Google+. (<a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">Gmail Blog</a>) "I know we feel the need to comment on everything right away these days, but honestly there isn't much to say about this feature until we've actually used it." (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787063">223 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. "The Drupal.org Security Team and Infrastructure Team has discovered unauthorized access to account information on Drupal.org and groups.drupal.org." Users are advised to change their password, not to reuse passwords between sites, and to turn on two-factor authentication. 
(<a href="https://drupal.org/news/130529SecurityUpdate">drupal.org</a>) 
"Malicious files were placed on association.drupal.org servers via a third-party application used by that site." - and commenters are wondering which third-party app was involved. 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788909">7 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. For $100/node/month, Linode announces a managed IT infrastructure. 
(<a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/05/29/introducing-linode-managed/">Linode</a>) 
"If the remote hands are awesome, this is well worth $100 per node. If they are anything but awesome, this wouldn't be worth it for any amount of money." 
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788576">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>4. "The Magazine" has been sold by founder Marco Arment to editor Glenn Fleishman.
(<a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/05/29/sold-the-magazine">Marco Arment</a>)
Instapaper. Tumblr. and now The Magazine. Sounds like Marco is clearing house a bit.
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787079">57 comments</a>)</p>
<p>5. How to negotiate a job offer. "If you’re not currently working, and you don’t have competing offers, you’re pretty much out of luck."
(<a href="http://blog.upstart.com/2013/05/how-to-negotiate-job-offer.html">Upstart</a>)
"The "Pre-Reqs" piece is not right. You really don't need to have another job offer or a current job to negotiate. "
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5787759">44 comments</a>)</p>
<p>6. Bill Gates is going to India because it has the grand challenge of extreme poverty and also the resources to attack that problem. He's also going to pick up some dance moves from a Bollywood star.
(<a href="http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Topics/Development/Why-Im-Going-to-India">The Gates Notes</a>)
"Have you seen real poverty? Just take a trip to Mumbai and visit the slums there."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5788874">25 comments</a>)</p>
<p>7. Amazon announces "Login with Amazon" as a single sign-on function for web sites.
(<a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1824961&highlight=">Amazon PR</a>)
"I think this is a great idea. I don't love the Facebook OAuth flow and the amount of access most apps ask for."
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5786554">69 comments</a>)</p>
<p>8. Mary Meeker's Internet Trends.

      <p><p>A late evening version of Hacker News for Tuesday 28 May 2013. I&#39;ve added links to the comments for each entry, and try to pull out a useful quote from the comments if there are any that are easy to find. Of interest: Pixar raytracing, Liberty Reserve money laundering, and Harvard email snooping.</p>
<p>1. A breakdown of github pull requests by acceptance rate, for a variety of languages and projects. If you want to get your pull request accepted, don&#39;t write C++, write Scala; and contribute to projects like Akka&#0160;and&#0160;backbone-fundamentals that take 80+% of pull requests. (<a href="http://paulmillr.com/posts/github-pull-request-stats/" target="_self">Paul Miller</a>)&#0160;&quot;<span style="color: #000000;">I&#39;m surprised the acceptance rate is so high.&quot;</span> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5783616" target="_self">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>2. &quot;Pixar&#39;s lighting/rendering systems were completely redone for their new film&#0160;<em>Monsters University.&quot; </em>Correspondence with Chris Horne, who worked on MU. &quot;So our Director of Photography went to a studio that is so clearly raytracing averse and essentially said &quot;We&#39;re raytracing everything.&quot; (<a href="http://thisanimatedlife.blogspot.com/2013/05/pixars-chris-horne-sheds-new-light-on.html?m=1" target="_self">Mason Smith</a>) (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5781904" target="_self">92 comments</a>)</p>
<p>3. &quot;Liberty Reserve, which was incorporated in 2006, was a &quot;bank of choice for the criminal underworld,&quot; according to the indictment, which said the operation allegedly laundered the money through 55 million transactions before it was shut down earlier this month.&quot; $6 billion was allegedly laundered. (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323855804578511121238052256.html" target="_self">Wall Street Journal</a>) The comments note the precarious legal position of various Bitcoin exchanges. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5783261" target="_self">50 comments</a>)</p>
<p>4. Topcoat is &quot;CSS for clean and fast web apps&quot;.&#0160;<a href="https://github.com/topcoat/topcoat/archive/0.3.0.zip" id="download-btn">Download version 0.3</a>&#0160;(Github). The comments compare it to Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5781369" target="_self">78 comments</a>)</p>
<p>5. Thomas Friedman writes about HireArt, which has HR software to better match candidates with job openings by tailoring tests and quizzes to the qualifications for the job.

<p>6. Evelynn Hammonds will step down as Harvard College dean, in the wake of a scandal involving searches of Harvard faculty and staff email accounts. She will return to teaching&#0160;and research in the History of Science and African and African American Studies departments.

<p>7. A Facebook engineer waxes poetical about his four years with the company and the engineering challenges he has faced.

<div>8. You have 13 days to buy the Humble Indie Bundle 8 with 7 games for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Pay what you want. (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_self">Humble Bundle</a>) The comments have game reviews, many of which are favorable. (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5781632" target="_self">53 comments</a>)
<p>9. Build startups and systems to help the &quot;unexotic underclass&quot;, which lives in small town America and includes single moms, returning veterans, and others who live outside of the startup-fueled glitz of Silicon Valley (<a href="https://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/" target="_self">C.Z. Nnaemeka</a>) &quot;Condense the article down and you&#39;re left with this nugget of advice: You&#39;ll have a better chance of success if you target unsaturated, boring markets.&quot; (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5782704" target="_self">28 comments</a>)</p>
<p>10. Pure is &quot;a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project&quot; brought to you by Yahoo! The library is tiny and works well with mobile applications.

      <p>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini. This comes together in a hurry - you can cook the whole thing up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Two or three cloves of garlic</li>
<li>Asparagus, about a pound</li>
<li>Button mushrooms, about a pound</li>
<li>Basil, dried or fresh</li>
<li>White wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<p>Boil water for pasta. When it&#39;s hot, cook the pasta. There should be time to drain it after you&#39;ve done the cooking of the asparagus.</p>
<p>Wash the asparagus, snap the tough ends, and slice on the bias into 1.5&quot; pieces. Clean the mushrooms and cut each one in half.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large frying pan on high. Fry the garlic until it&#39;s light brown and smells great.</p>
<p>Add the asparagus to the frying pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the asparagus is bright green. Add the mushrooms and keep stirring. When the mushrooms are hot, add the white wine, stir, and cover.</p>
<p>The recipe called for basil, but I didn&#39;t put it in because I was hurrying to get everything together.</p>
<p>The wine will deglaze the pan and make a nice sauce. Serve with pasta and white wine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>oil for frying</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>1 bag kale</li>
<li>corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better</li>
<li>green onions - chopped</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Wash and spin-dry the kale, being careful to get dirt out of the center rib. We had a very nice bag of small kale from market that didn&#39;t require much more than this, but if you have older, tougher kales, trim them of their tough bits and cut them into pieces.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large pot on medium high to high. Chop some garlic into big pieces. Fry the garlic until light brown and it smells good.</p>
<p>Add the kale and cook, stirring frequently, until the kale has cooked down to a fraction of its original size. Add some corn and the chopped green onions; stir. Cook until the corn is warmed through, then add some soy sauce and cover and turn down the heat to low.</p>
<p>One bag of kale served the family, with one person not eating it; there were a few leftovers. This recipe would multiply quite nicely.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">Yesterbox: answer yesterday&#39;s email, today</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://yesterbox.com" target="_self">Yesterbox</a> is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. In contrast, &quot;yesterbox&quot; gives you a finite number of messages to work through from yesterday, and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. There&#39;s no need to feel guilty, no need to feel like you&#39;re procrastinating, and no need to obsessively check today&#39;s messages. They can all be dealt with tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hseih estimates that it takes him three hours to plow through a day&#39;s messages, and he puts that time on his calendar in the morning to handle the previous day&#39;s correspondence. That&#39;s the world of a busy and successful CEO - you might well have a different time chunk that you&#39;d need to commit to, probably a lot less.</p>
<p>Emptying the inbox is a Sisyphean task. Yesterbox tries to make it a finite problem to handle. As a bonus, every conversation becomes a slow conversation, and there&#39;s a lot of routine unimportant detail in everyone&#39;s inbox that can be ignored once a day has gone past.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-on-summarization/">On summarization</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.</p>
<p>Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough. You might have to stitch together bits of several sentences to get one that describes the whole thing.</p>
<p>Summarization is active reading, and it improves recall. There&#39;s nothing quite like looking through a piece of text for its inner core to give you a real sense for what it&#39;s all about, and if you have to synthesize something new you recall that better than if you just hit the &quot;like&quot; button.&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;m skeptical of automated summarization, mostly because there seem to be enough people in the world interested in doing it by hand to make machine-aided cognition superfluous at least for popular articles. Machine reading works I suppose if you have so few eyes on the text that you have to crunch on it to make sense of it, but if there&#39;s an internet crowd to do that work the machine can simply tally human efforts instead of doing complicated automated text processing.</p>
<p>Hacker News is a challenging news stream to summarize because it turns over so quickly. In 12 hours or less, the top of the front page is fully new, and it&#39;s time to summarize again. I&#39;ve been doing it daily rather than 2x daily because the yield of interestingness just isn&#39;t there to call for more. There are other tech newsfeeds and newswires that are worth digesting, but not all of them are sufficiently different from Hacker News to provide a divergent task. For example, the top &quot;popular&quot; links on Pinboard overlap substantially with Hacker News, as does the front page of TechMeme.</p>
<p>Pinboard looks like it has the right kind of infrastructure to support summarization as a part of a workflow. The path would be to identify an interesting article, clip the good bit, hit &quot;pin&quot;, paste in the good bit, add a few tags, and save. To extract the useful stuff out you&#39;d run a report on the tag that you used that was unique to the category you were summarizing.</p>
<p>Summarization lends itself to pointless numbered bullshit (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2009/07/seven-things-i-want-to-remember-to-tell-you-about-blogging.html" target="_self">cf. #4 on this list</a>). Lots of articles are written with teaser headlines (5 best ways to do x) and can be unpacked by undoing the tease (The 5 best ways to do x are a, b, c, d, and e). You might take as your goal producing a summary that either dispenses with the need to read the original or that points the reader towards the best of what you have gone through and digested for them.</p>

      <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.</p>
<p>I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. A useful bit of code would monitor the site, send off a batch of 10 articles to be summarized, and then wait checking periodically until those 10 have all fallen from favor to send out a new batch of 10.</p>

      <p><p>Compiled hastily, here&#39;s a summary of today&#39;s Hacker News top 10. Based solely on the top 10, it&#39;s a slow news day.</p>
<p>1. &quot;If you try to get several regular polygons to meet snugly at a point in the plane, what’s the most sides any of the polygons can have?

While training in 1917 to join the infantry and fight in&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>&#0160;he meets and promptly falls in love with the beautiful Daisy, who represents everything he is not: she is rich, from a patrician East Coast family and born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth. After the war, from which he emerged as a hero for his participation in the bloody battles of&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Marne" title="Battle of the Marne">Marne</a>&#0160;and&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Argonne" title="Battle of Argonne">Argonne</a>, he attends&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford" title="Trinity College, Oxford">Trinity College</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>. While there he receives a letter from Daisy telling him she has married the equally aristocratic Tom Buchanan. Rather than admit defeat, he commits his life to becoming a man of the sort of wealth and stature he imagines could win her love.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gatz returned home to an America transformed by&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">prohibition</a>&#0160;in 1919, a period in American history in which gangsters earned the sort of vast wealth previously the domain of the connected upper classes, an era in which &quot;all the old boundaries that separated the classes were being broken, and a new wave of instant millionaires, like Gatsby himself&hellip; mingled with the polo-players who inhabited the stiff enclaves of the established rich of Long Island&#39;s gold coast.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&#0160;This era later came to be known as the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age" title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</a>, after Fitzgerald&#39;s own coinage.</p>
<p>Gatz, who renamed himself Jay Gatsby, made a fortune in bootlegging thanks to his association with gangsters like Meyer Wolfsheim (patterned after real-life American gangster&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rothstein" title="Arnold Rothstein">Arnold Rothstein</a>) and sets himself up in a mansion in the fictional West Egg, Long Island, a haunt of the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveaux_riche" title="Nouveaux riche">nouveaux riche</a>&#0160;and across from the old-line money East Egg, where Tom and Daisy Buchanan live. Gatsby hosts wild parties, open to all comers, there every weekend, in the hopes that Daisy will attend and he can win her heart. He eventually catches up with Daisy, but fails to convince her to leave Tom. After his failure to change Daisy&#39;s mind is clear to all but him, Daisy drives Gatsby&#39;s car with Gatsby in the passenger seat and she accidentally strikes and kills Myrtle, the lover of her husband Tom, in a hit-and-run accident. Myrtle&#39;s jealous husband George tracks the car back to the Buchanan home, where Tom lies and tells him that Gatsby was the driver of the car that killed his wife. George goes to Gatsby&#39;s house, finds him floating in his lavish pool, and murders him before taking his own life. Almost none of Gatsby&#39;s high society friends attend his funeral and in the meantime Gatsby&#39;s underworld connections begin picking through his belongings in his mansion.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Gatsby as a reference point</h2>
<p>The figure of Jay Gatsby became a cultural touchstone in 20th century America.&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mathews" title="Chris Mathews">Chris Mathews</a>&#0160;in his book&#0160;<em>American</em>&#0160;even forgives Gatsby his serial lies. When the poor native son Gatsby tells Nick Carraway, his only true friend and a relative of Daisy&#39;s, he was brought up wealthy and that he attended Oxford because &quot;all my ancestors have been educated there&quot; Mathews sees him as the eternal American striver. &quot;Gatsby needed more than money: he needed to be someone who had&#0160;<em>always</em>&#0160;had it&hellip; this blind faith that he can retrofit his very existence to Daisy&#39;s specifications is the heart and soul of the&#0160;<em>The Great Gatsby</em>. It&#39;s the classic story of the fresh start, the second chance.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>&quot;Jay Gatsby&hellip; appears to be the quintessential American male hero. He is a powerful businessman with shady connections, drives a glamorous car&hellip; and pursues the beautiful, privileged Daisy,&quot; Michael Kimmel and Amy Aronson write.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;In the Handbook of American Folklore, Richard Dorson sees Gatsby as a new American archetype who made a decision to transform himself after his first chance encounter with his mentor Dan Cody, who opens the door to riches in boot-legging. &quot;The ragged youth who some months later (after Gatsby drops out of St. Olaf) introduces himself to a degenerate yachtsman as Jay Gatsby has explicitly rejected the Protestant ethic&hellip; in favor of a much more extravagant form of ambition.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Referring to real life figures as&#0160;<em>Gatsby</em>&#0160;has been common in the United States, usually in reference to rich men whose rise to prominence involved an element of deception. In a story on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Foster_Winans" title="R. Foster Winans">R. Foster Winans</a>, a reporter for the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>&#39;s&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column who was fired after it was discovered he was giving advance knowledge of the columns&#39; contents to Peter Brant, the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post_Intelligencer" title="Seattle Post Intelligencer">Seattle Post Intelligencer</a>&#0160;described Brant as &quot;Winan&#39;s Gatsby.&quot; The article noted that Brant had changed his name from Bornstein and said he was &quot;a man who turned his back on his heritage and his family because he felt that being recognized as Jewish would be a detriment to his career.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>&#0160;The&#0160;<em>Heard on the Street</em>&#0160;column often effects the prices of the stocks it mentions.</p>
<p>The character is often used as a symbol of great wealth. Reporting in 2009 on the collapse of home prices and tourist spending in the exclusive&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamptons" title="Hamptons">Hamptons</a>&#0160;on Long Island, not far from the fictional setting of Gatsby&#39;s home, the Wall Street Journal quoted a struggling hotelier as saying &quot;Jay Gatsby is dead.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Gatsby&amp;oldid=321578117#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>

      </h3>
      <p>An attempt to catch the top news of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_self">Hacker News</a> on a Friday evening and summarize the top 10 stories; I won&#39;t make any decisions about what should be in the top 10, just note them here with a summary. It took me about 30 minutes to summarize 10 stories, without being selective about which ones were important.</p>
<p>1. Ben Howdle is &quot;Too scared to write a line of code&quot; (<a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/eef96ea6f4cb?imm_mid=0a9102&amp;cmp=em-velocity-newsletters-vl-save20-20130523-direct" target="_self">Medium</a>). This reminds me of the Donald Knuth quote, &quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;.</p>
<p>2. Yahoo has &quot;submitted a bid for the video site&quot; Hulu (<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130524/yet-another-hulu-bidder-yahoo-is-in-too/" target="_self">All Things D</a>). They&#39;re not the only ones bidding, with Directv, Time Warner Cable, and several others in the running.&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Benjamin BenBen lets you visualize &quot;how CSS rules are applied to a page&quot; (<a href="http://css.benjaminbenben.com/" target="_self">css.benjaminbenben.com</a>). If it&#39;s hanging, give Chrome a try.</p>
<p>4. B is &quot;fast on the road and agile in the air&quot; (<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2017062404/b-go-beyond" target="_self">Kickstarter</a>). It&#39;s a four-wheeled remote control vehicle that doubles as a quadcopter when the going gets rough.</p>
<p>5. &quot;If you already have a strong passphrase on your SSH private key, then converting it from the traditional private key format to PKCS#8 is roughly comparable to adding two extra keystrokes to your passphrase, for free.&quot; (<a href="http://martin.kleppmann.com/2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html" target="_self">Martin Kleppmann</a>) Bonus: it&#39;s only four lines of shell to do this and verify that it works.</p>
<p>6. Plan 9 has some very tightly written, very strange C code; &quot;it’s not every day that you come across code that makes you feel funny because of its unusual syntactic structure&quot; (<a href="http://computationallyendowed.com/blog/2012/12/03/ifs-and-ands-and-plan-9s-source-code.html" rel="author" target="_self">Spiros Eliopoulos</a>). In this case it&#39;s nested if() clauses without indents that replace a more traditional use of &amp;&amp;.</p>

(<a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2013/05/24/jquery-1-10-0-and-2-0-1-released/" target="_self">jQuery</a>) What&#39;s new: &quot;Our main goal with these two releases is to synchronize the features and behavior of the 1.x and 2.x lines, as we pledged a year ago when jQuery 2.0 was announced.&quot;</p>

      <p>This is breaking news, and this blog post will be out of date.</p>
<p>The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River has collapsed near Mount Vernon, Washington. A map shows where the incident happened, about half way between Seattle and the Canadian border.</p>

<p>The I-5 Skagit River Bridge is a through-truss bridge that was built in 1955, according to the website Bridgehunter.com. It is the same basic type of design of the Interstate 5 Bridge over the Columbia River in Vancouver, according to the site.</p>
