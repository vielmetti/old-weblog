      <p>Do you ever get into a groove where everything is easy and you can just work on things because the next thing in front of you is the next thing you need to do?</p>
<p>I love it when that happens.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.</a></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;<a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Smart grid">smart grid</a>&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online.</p>
<p>To support a continuing interest in this field, I&#39;m looking at starting up a new blog to capture news articles, collect new maps and applications as they appear, and generally keep up with the world of smart grid mapping efforts. Look for this on a new <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/outage" target="_self">Power Outage Mapping</a> weblog.</p>

      <p>I used the Automark machine to vote today, as I did in 2010 (<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/voting-machine-links-automark/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story</a>) and in 2008 (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html" target="_self">Vacuum post</a>).</p>

<p>This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.</p>
<p>For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. Since I can see just fine, I wasn&#39;t able to tell if the audio instructions were perfect, but they seemed pretty good and straightforward.</p>
<p>After my encounter with the poll worker, I went to city hall to give the election officials a report on what had happened. The person I talked to at city hall pulled out a guide to poll workers (from 2008) and did not immediately find specific instructions one way or the other about using the Automark, but we didn&#39;t read every page.</p>

      <p>Tonight&#39;s Ann Arbor City Council meeting <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2012/05/07/city-council-oks-justice-center-art/" target="_self">discussed at great length the expenditure of some sizable sum of money for art</a> that would be installed in the secured lobby of the Justice Center part of City Hall, where would you have to go through a security check to visit it.</p>
<p>What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it.</p>
<p>A proposal was put forth to not spend the money on art and to renovate some bathrooms in the building instead. This left a missed opportunity to instead ready-made art as part of that installation. (photo: wikimedia commons, from the original photo by Alfred Stieglitz).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar characteristics of writing for yourself and not just creating copy is that you end up finding things from your past that you still own enough to re-edit and rework as needed. A recent discussion on Twitter about paw paws helped me unearth <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/papaws-the-mich.html" target="_self">a 2008 collection of scrapbook entries about the fruit, its names, and how it tastes.</a>&nbsp;If I had produced this content for an employer (or an ex-employer), it would be long since frozen and old; but because it's just my writing, I can go back and make it better four years later.</p>
<p>I've been happy with Typepad for a long time. Recently, some of the management changes at the organization that runs it have led to some changes in the marketing around the service, so that the relatively few old-school bloggers like me still on the system seem less and less to be the target audience, in favor of professional media people who have a certain number of words of content that they are obligated to produce before they move to the next task. I guess I can only be hopeful that the sorts of tools that are needed to crank out content on the job can also be used for old fashioned blogging where the deadlines are less definite and the goals more ambiguous.</p>

The paw paw discussion came and went on Twitter, as twitter things tend to do, without leaving too much of an obvious trace; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MickiMaynard/status/196658685341220864" target="_self">Micki Maynard</a> and Dave Askins were at the center of it.

<p>In 2011, the number of workers belonging to a union in Michigan was 671,000, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported [on&#0160;Monday, April 9, 2012]. Regional Commissioner Charlene Peiffer noted that union members accounted for 17.5 percent of wage and salary workers in Michigan in 2011 compared to 16.5 percent a year earlier. At its peak in 1989, the first year state data were available, Michigan’s union membership rate was 26.0 percent.

<p>David Erdody, a digital curator at the Bentley Historical Library, discovered a series of 20 photo negatives in early January that feature King giving a speech and hosting a discussion at the University.

<p>In our new building, paint is going onto the walls. The reading nooks looking out onto the courtyard are warm with color. The sun comes in through the huge windows and skylights, and every way you look there are views to the trees outside. The flexible learning spaces - the common areas, breakout spaces, front porches for the classrooms, the open library space - are everything I hoped they would be. The music and drama studio, the science lab, the art room, the classrooms; they are all spacious, bright, gorgeous places. Soon they will be alive with children and the hum of projects and great ideas.&#0160;<br /><br /></p>

<p>Disclaimer: my son goes to Summers-Knoll School, and he&#39;s looking forward to having more kids in his age range, so I&#39;m particularly eager to recruit 7th and 8th graders.</p>

<p>DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.</p>
<p>Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Busch&#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky.</p>
<p>Second Street was worst hit in the old part of Dexter village. Every second house on the downhill side of Second had a blue tarp on part of a roof, but the uphill side had no roof damage. Several businesses on Second were damaged, including a laudromat that was completely demolished.</p>
<p>The tornado crossed the Norfolk Southern tracks right by the Dexter Mill. Several homes on Huron Street had blue tarps as well. The Dexter cider mill looked OK, but it was closed for the season. Damage at the Dexter Mill included large sheets of metal that had been twisted around like crumpled paper.</p>
<p>Downtown was completely normal with no visible damage. The Dexter Bakery smelled like a bakery that my great aunt might have taken me to 30 years ago. The Dairy Queen was serving up standard issue cones, with a long line in the unseasonably warm March summer.</p>
<p>Many trucks went past as I enjoyed my cone with trailers or truckbeds full of full-grown trees, cut into short logs or big chunks. Signs were up everywhere for home repair and remodeling, and a number of insurance companies had trucks or vans parked to take claims.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable storm, in part because of the damage, and in part because there was no loss of life. It could have been much, much worse. I am sure that residents of Dexter will be glad for construction to rebuild homes and put people&#39;s lives back towards normal.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-02-18-ann-arbor-municipal-irritant/">City of Ann Arbor turns down request for meeting minutes, again</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff.</p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups. For instance:</p>
<p>The Local Development Finance Authority is the city body that allocates economic development funds from tax capture to development organizations, primarily Ann Arbor SPARK. As of the latest board packet, there is no treasurer to this organization, as none of the existing board members were willing to serve in that role. There is one open position on that board as of this writing.</p>
<p>The Sign Board of Appeals meets only when citizens or businesses have an appeal to decisions made under the city&#39;s Sign Ordinance. This body only has 4 members seated, with 3 vacancies. As a result, that board did not elect officers and did not approve the most recent minutes of a previous meeting. The Sign Ordinance is said to be up for review, according to the draft minutes that I looked at, but the Sign Board had not seen that draft.</p>
<p>The Zoning Board of Appeals meetings to hear appeals to the city&#39;s zoning laws. Here was the most unusual result that I had from a series of Freedom of Information Act requests: the draft minutes of the last meeting, in December, were not available when I asked for them, and the city turned down a FOIA request for those minutes. Under the Michigan Open Meetings Act, draft minutes are to be made available within 8 days of a public meeting being held. I appealed that decision - and it&#39;s appalling that I should have to go through the FOIA appeals process just to read meeting minutes - and was given the minutes the day after my appeal. This <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/12/07/zba-turns-down-city-place-appeal/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle civic news ticker</a> has the results of that meeting, which was controversial and resulted in the rejection of neighborhood appeals to the City Place development decision.</p>
<p>Is it unusual for a public body to turn down requests for meeting minutes? It&#39;s happened to me before, when I had to go through <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/on-asking-for-something-you-know-doesnt-exist/" target="_self">a protacted series of requests to get minutes from the Historic District Commission.</a>&#0160;The first time you do this, it&#39;s an exciting process of delving into the fine points of carefully worded language to appeal a city decision. The second time, it&#39;s just tedious and frustrating to have to go all the way to the city administrator just to get minutes to read. I suppose I&#39;ll keep earning my title of &quot;municipal irritant&quot; one way or another, even without attending the meetings.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Penn State football coach Joe Paterno died January 22, 2012, of complications from lung cancer treatment. He was 85. Hours before, his death was prematurely announced by multiple news services, prompting retractions and apologies from those organizations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/16960572" target="_self">CBSSports.com extends apology to Paterno family:<br /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier Saturday night, CBSSports.com published an unsubstantiated report that former Penn State coach Joe Paterno had died. That mistake was the result of a failure to verify the original report. CBSSports.com holds itself to high journalistic standards, and in this circumstance tonight, we fell well short of those expectations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The twitter account that first reported former Penn State coach Joe Paterno died just posted an update linking to a letter of resignation from its managing editor, Devon Edwards.</p>
<p>Once the normally reputable national CBS Sports outlet picked up the student news source’s story, the now-retracted report of Paterno’s death went national.</p>

The CBS Sports headline and story was based, seemingly, on erroneous reporting by the Penn State student publication ‘<a href="http://www.onwardstate.com/" target="_blank">Onward State</a>.’ The original CBS Sports obituary didn’t directly attribute the student paper.&#0160; The Huffington Post followed with a&#0160;<a href="http://twitpic.com/8a4wyv" target="_blank">story</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable.</p>

<p>Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don't always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it's possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care. Arborwiki fits the bill for this for me; I've made a lot<br />
of edits there, but the most popular pages have the most diverse edit base.</p>

<p>Team wikis appear in this decade to be embedded in some other bigger system that needs a shared editable place but that also has some other explicitly transactional work going on. Wiki nature does not include the verbs "assign", "delegate", "report on", or even really "decide", and if you are doing any kind of process work you often land on something beyond a<br />
simple "edit this page". <br />

      </h3>
      <p>A proposal to reform the calendar system, circa 1935, would have simplified the seasons by making every single year have the same calendar, every single quarter have 91 days and 13 Sundays, and every January 1 always fall on a Sunday. Leap years are accomodated with a mid-year extra Saturday, and the end of the year is celebrated as Year End Day, also as an extra Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0168e50bb871970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0168e50bb871970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0168e50bb871970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 1" /></a><br />This image is from&#0160;<a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/003525873" target="_self">Why reform the calendar? : A symposium of opinion prepared for the Special Committee on Calendar Reform of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York</a>, as found on HathiTrust.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the <a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org" target="_self">World Calendar Association</a> is still going strong. A word from their web site on the origin of this proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ASSETS/AchelisPronunciation.swf" target="_blank"><strong>Elisabeth Achelis</strong></a>&#0160;spread the New York Times out on her desk, momentarily blanketing the plaque dear to her that bore this quote of&#0160;unknown Persian origin. On that Sunday,&#0160;<strong>September 8, 1929</strong>&#0160;(a date&#0160;she never forgot and one she revisited fondly in her 1961 autobiography,<em>&#0160;<strong>Be Not Silent</strong></em>), Elisabeth found a&#0160;<a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org/8September1929-NYT.htm" target="_blank"><strong>letter to the editor of the New York Times</strong></a>&#0160;by Lewis E. Ashbaugh of Denver, Colorado. In a brief, almost casual tone, Ashbaugh suggested that the then-unofficial National Committee on Calendar Simplification should consider the adoption of a twelve-month, equal-quarter calendar (perhaps suggested as early as 1745 and published by Abbe´ Mastrofini in 1834) over that of the thirteen-month one that was rapidly gaining popular favor. Elisabeth saw much in this simply revised calendar plan, and instantaneously knew that her five-year search for something to help the world in which she lived had come to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose that calendar reform is no less exotic than speling reform, and that a 12 month rearranged calendar is less exotic than a 13 month calendar where every month has a Friday the 13th.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-28-5-popular-maps/">5 most popular maps of 2011 for this blog</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Here's the 5 most popular mapping pages on Vacuum over the past 12 months - these are all in the top 10 most popular pages on this blog overall in that time span.</p>

<p>1.  <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html">Power outage maps for 50 states</a>. I only really have about 44 states with maps, but the collection is otherwise excellent, and it gets lots of search traffic when there are big storms. Peak storm action of Hurricane Irene and of the Halloween snowstorm that hit the Northeast both saw 3000+ visits per day of people looking for outage maps for their area.</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/01/australia-flood-map-january-10-2011.html">Australia flood maps for January, 2011.</a> Brisbane got socked with floods in January, and the maps capture the weather at the time plus links of the day and some astounding flood footage.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/2011-vermont-flood-maps-irene.html">Vermont flood maps for Hurricane Irene.</a> When Irene hit Vermont, roads were washed out, travel was disrupted, and towns were cut off from the world. A number of organizations put together rapid response flooding maps, and some of these are saved here.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/tsunami-maps-for-march-2011-honshu-earthquake.html">Tsunami maps</a> and maps of Fukushima after the nuclear disaster in Japan. It was easy to be glued to the net for news in March about the Honshu earthquake and its impact on Japan; this post was put together the day of the quake as news slowly emerged about tsunami risks.</p>

<p>5. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/central-texas-fires.html">Central Texas fire maps.</a> Put together for friends and family near Austin, Texas, this collection of maps includes the Weather Underground fire layer map, one of the best near real time fire watching tools out there, as seen for the Bastrop County, Texas fires in September.</p>

<p>What do I conclude about this? </p>

<p>If all I wanted to do was maximize the number of page views that I got, I would be consistently pulling together maps about every modern day meteorological disaster. Fire, flood, power outage, tsunami, hurricane, snowstorm, have at it - every single one of them has a map to go with the story, and every time there's a story someone looks for the map to go with it.</p>

<p>Most news reporting doesn't pull in anywhere near the richness and detail that a good set of map searches will do, and most map sites that display real time data don't save every possible newsworthy map event. Combine these two, and you can be certain that the maps you collect will tell a story that's otherwise hard to illustrate.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If I read Facebook for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;like&quot; things, and generally let people know that I exist.</p>
<p>If I read Twitter for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;favorite&quot; things, and generally let people know that they exist.</p>
<p>When I sit in front of Typepad ready to type, it&#39;s not always for the short post, and often it&#39;s not even for an audience. My working assumption is that unless I&#39;m writing about something that the world cares about, only a handful of people will see it. The other working assumption is that I really don&#39;t know before I write it how it will be received, so it better be good enough for me to want to refer to again just for myself.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve referred to Vacuum as an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s also a place to capture &quot;interior stories&quot;, internal monologue that makes sense about how you do things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.getstoried.com/2010/05/19/interview-christina-baldwin/" target="_self">(Christina) Baldwin</a> says that if people aren’t attached to their interior stories, they get <span style="background-color: #80ffff;">addicted to feedback</span>. Although I would have considered myself attached to my interior story, I also recognize a social-media feedback addiction in myself. I’m always curious about what kinds of comments that my, for example, Facebook status updates, have generated. (from <a href="http://astoriedcareer.com/2010/06/those-unattached-to-their-inte.html" target="_self">A Storied Career</a>, &#0160;a blog by&#0160;Kathy Hansen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you write to inform yourself, and the goal isn&#39;t to create or please your followers, or to get new ones, or to up your page view count or close a new lead. It&#39;s just to write, and to capture what&#39;s going by in your head to the level that you can recreate it later.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog has always been for me an exercise in locating other people&#39;s words to help illustrate my point. That gives it some measure of similarity to a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2010/12/its-worth-writing-it-down-even-if-you-dont-know-who-the-audience-is-yet.html" target="_self">commonplace book</a>, a traditional way to copy out bits of prose that you wish to make your own into a kind of clippings book or scrapbook of words.</p>
<p>I&#39;m content, really, to be &quot;addicted to feedback&quot;, but I reserve the right to look for the right kind of feedback to tune into. The feedback of blogging is the long, low rumble of old notebooks that have just the right relevant bits to tune into, and not just the shrill, high ping of social media contacts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://bjfogg.com" target="_self">BJ Fogg</a> is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce <a href="http://bit.ly/3tinyhabits" target="_self">three tiny habits</a> that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a perfect example of a tiny habit, since cleaning the kitchen can take a while.</p>
<p>The practice of tiny habits is radically different from the typical New Year&#39;s Resolution which is grandiose, sweeping, and hard to fulfill. &quot;Be a better person&quot; is really different from &quot;brush your teeth after you floss them&quot; or &quot;go to bed after the computer goes to sleep&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out the tiny habit that will get me writing regularly. Ideally, in some perfect world, I&#39;d write more regularly. I don&#39;t want a &quot;write a page every day&quot; goal, because that&#39;s largely unmanagable - when would I do it? But perhaps I can set myself a tiny goal, that&#39;s more like &quot;when I sit down at the computer after the kitchen is clean, open it up to my blog and start writing until I stop.&quot;</p>
<p>At the very least, that will ensure that the kitchen will be clean before bedtime.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-17-associative-memory-and-the-mental-rolodex/">The mental rolodex</a>
      </h3>
      <p>There&#39;s a great use of the term in an LA Magazine review of &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.</blockquote>
<p>Credits: the &quot;mental rolodex&quot; term is one I heard first from&#0160;<a href="http://trybean.com">Terry Bean</a>, who used it at an LA2M presentation. It&#39;s also from&#0160;<a href="http://rebekahburgess.blogspot.com/">Rebekah Burgess&#39;s weblog of the same name</a>, where she is doing a daily photograph and filing that away for reference.&#0160;</p>
<p>And kids, if you don&#39;t know what a rolodex is, it&#39;s from the days when people had land lines phones only and their phones were so dumb that they didn&#39;t have an address book built into them. Instead, they wrote down phone numbers on little pieces of specially shaped paper, and those pieces of paper fit into a clever device that could be flipped through or (in ultra cool setup) spun like a Ferris wheel.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Typepad has a very convenient &quot;drafts&quot; folder into which you can write things that aren&#39;t ready for publication yet. My drafts folder is overflowing. I suppose that means that the editor in me is looking forward to reviewing them and sending them back for revisions.</p>
<p>If you wait long enough between the time you write something and the time you publish it, it&#39;s possible that you can make your writing enough better to be worth the wait. Generally, though, the work that I like the most has been edited in public. If my writing doesn&#39;t escape the draft folder quickly, chances are pretty good that it isn&#39;t ever worth publishing, even in an open notebook.</p>

Digitization is seen variously as a boon and scourge, depending on the viewer, the issue at hand, and sometimes even the time of day. As with many polarizing phenomena, there is merit on both sides. If we look carefully at the functions that we want libraries to perform, we see that although most (but not all) are made technically easier with digitization, many are made organizationally more difficult, both within libraries and within the institutions that support them and use them. Preservation, which I will argue is an essential function of academic libraries, is the most straightforward example of something that is much more difficult to organize with digital media than it was with print. Scholarly publishing, without which libraries would have little to do, is stuck with a set of institutions and practices that are ill-suited to take advantage of digital technologies. And then there is copyright. Taking as given that we now live in a world where it extremely inexpensive to copy, distribute, search, mix, and remix, it is still not entirely clear how best to respond to what should be good news. The answers depend on what we want and how willing we are to collaborate in the interest of achieving it. As in many cases, successful exploitation of changes in technology requires changes in the way activities are organized.<br />

<p>Love me some sammiches, and I'm sure there's at least one Ann Arbor area sandwich worth mentioning in A Sandwich A Day. (I'll bet you could eat a different sandwich every day without leaving downtown Ann Arbor.)</p>

      </h3>
      <blockquote>[New] technologies are currently being viewed as either substitutes for, or possible augmentations of, human faculties. I argue that the proffered scenarios of computerized ‘help’ for human activities evident in the ubiquitous computing world tends to focus on augmentation of human remembering, with sensors and computer networks archiving vast amounts of data, but neglects to consider what augmentation might mean when it comes to that other human activity, namely, forgetting. (5)</blockquote>
<p><small>via <a href="http://www.contemplativecomputing.org/2011/12/forgetting-as-a-feature-not-a-bug.html">www.contemplativecomputing.org</a></small></p>
<p>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is reading an article by <a href="http://www.idc.ul.ie/people/liam-bannon" target="_self">Liam Bannon</a>, director of the Interaction Design Centre at the University of Limerick, on forgetting as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>I started down the path of thinking about how computers currently handle the process of forgetting, and as part of that better understand what kind of metaphors are missing for the task of augmenting forgetting.</p>
<p>There&#39;s the notion of &quot;garbage collection&quot;, when unwanted memory is reclaimed. That process relies on a way of marking unwanted (computer) memory as forgettable. Every so often the garbage collection process runs, slowing down the system as it does, and cleaning up the mess left behind.</p>
<p>Computers also have the notion and defect of a &quot;memory leak&quot;, where unwanted memory accumulates in a state where it&#39;s taking up space but not really doing anything. A slow memory leak in a long running process will eventually bring a system down as more and more system resources are absorbed and never freed.</p>
<p>When memory does go bad in a computer world, it&#39;s &quot;bitrot&quot; - think about old tapes that have glitch errors, or more importantly old computer programs that have a hard time digesting new formats of data. This often happens when a new and improved technology foregoes compatibility with old formats, with the clean slate being easier to build from rather than re-encrufting some old system.</p>
<p>Cloud computing has its own feature of forgetting, in the &quot;sunset&quot; phase of an online service where unpopular, unprofitable, or unendearing features or services get deliberately turned off. If you had relied on that system for your external memory you are in for a rude surprise.</p>
<p>The worrisome aspect of computer memory is its binary nature, where a single transient glitch can render mass storage unreadable, and so rather than the healthy forgetting of the human brain you get sudden unrecoverable failure. Your carefully pickled up thoughts or rolodex full of context vanishes, and suddenly you have to rely on your mental rolodex rather than the paper or electronic one to recall details.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It almost didn't happen, however. After finishing the regular season 10-2, the Wolverines needed help from other teams around the country on Saturday and from the pollsters on Sunday morning in order to be in this position -- and they received it. </p>

<p>On Virginia Tech, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/virginia-tech-hokies-a-surprise-pick-for-sugar-bowl/2011/12/04/gIQAghsCUO_story.html">Washington Post writes</a> "one of the most surprising Bowl Championship Series at-large picks ever". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virginia Tech’s BCS at-large hopes appeared to evaporate after its 38-10 loss to Clemson in the ACC championship game Saturday. While the Hokies have been ranked all season, they have not defeated a team currently in the Associated Press top 25 poll.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game is in New Orleans, and Michigan's ever-efficient alumni association has an <a href="http://alumni.umich.edu/sports/athletic-tours-and-travel-packages/official-bowl-tours">official bowl tour package</a> complete with chartered flights. </p>

<p>New Orleans is a great place to eat a sandwich. <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/686440">Chowhound has a best sandwiches</a> thread that's got a lot of great suggestions; I'd pick a banh mi (in its role as a Vietnamese po'boy). In Ann Arbor the blog "Meg Goes Nom Nom" has a <a href="http://meggoesnomnom.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/meggoesnomnoms-one-year-birthday-banh-mi/">glowing review of the banh mi from Zingerman's</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And a few months after this occurred, I discovered that the featured sandwich at local favorite Zingerman’s Delicatessen was the Banh Mi. It was time! And not only get to try the sandwich, I got to meet the talented creator of this legit sandwich while I was there. Awesome! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Zing sandwich was done by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanstreetfood">San Street</a>, a food cart which alas I have not checked out myself yet.</p>

<p>The Viet World Kitchen blog has a <a href="http://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/06/banh-mi-sandwich-recipe.html">master banh mi recipe</a> which pretty much sums up what you'd need to put together your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is essentially one sandwich in Vietnamese cooking and it is quite a tour de force. It started out very simply, with baguette smeared with liver pate and that was it. That's how my mom knew it in the 1940s when she was growing up in Northern Vietnam. What we know today as banh mi is a light, crispy small baguette that is split and hollowed before it is invariably filled with homemade mayonnaise or butter (which I don't like), sliced chili pepper, cilantro leaves, cucumber, a tangy-sweet daikon and carrot pickle (do chua), and a drizzle of soy sauce. The variation comes in when you choose what protein component(s) will be center stage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More recipe action gets you a <a href="http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2010/08/13/do-chua-vietnamese-carrot-and-daikon-pickle/">do chua recipe from the blog Sticky Gooey Creamy Chewy</a>, which sounds easy enough to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do chua is so incredibly easy to make. Since it is a “fresh” pickle, there is no boiling or cooking involved. All you do is julienne the carrots and daikon, and soak them in a brine made with white vinegar, rice wine vinegar, a little water, sugar and a pinch of salt. That’s it!  Plus, the pickles only need to marinate in their brine for about an hour before they’re ready to devour.</p>

<p>Now, you are ready for some football.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The technical description is from <a href="http://drought.unl.edu/MonitoringTools/NASAGRACEDataAssimilation.aspx">Groundwater and Soil Moisture Conditions from GRACE Data Assimilation</a>, one of the sets of maps available at the <a href="http://drought.unl.edu/">National Drought Mitigation Center</a> at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2002, NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites are unique in their ability to measure variations in water stored at all levels above and within the land surface (terrestrial water storage). However, the spatial (>150,000 km2) and temporal (monthly with a significant time lag) resolutions of the GRACE fields limit their direct applicability for drought assessment. In order to increase the resolution, eliminate the time lag, and isolate groundwater and other components from total terrestrial water storage, scientists at NASA/GSFC integrate the GRACE data with other ground- and space-based meteorological observations (precipitation, solar radiation, etc.) within the Catchment Land Surface Model, using Ensemble Kalman smoother type data assimilation (Zaitchik et al., 2008). The resulting fields of soil moisture and groundwater storage variations are then used to generate drought indicators based on the cumulative distribution function of wetness conditions during 1948-2009 simulated by the Catchment model. Houborg et al. (2011) provide complete details on GRACE-based drought indicator product generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got it? This map shows groundwater storage estimated with this model, showing the extensive drought conditions in Texas as well as the wet northeast.</p>
