<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Some maps of South Sudan, which is in the news today because of an emerging civil war.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unocha.org/south-sudan/">UNOCHA South Sudan</a> describes the displaced persons in South Sudan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting.</p>

<p>The UNOCHA briefing map detail shows the detail of cities. Juba is in the province of Central Equatoria.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.</p>

<p>Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers.</p>

<p>A useful mechanism of self-guidance for me is to ensure that every post fits into at least one existing category. It doesn't help that I have to date created <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/archives.html">two hundred and thirty eight categories</a> into which something might fit. That at least is honest; this weblog doesn't have one narrow focus, and it's been running for ten years, so some divergence of interests is not just anticipated but expected.</p>

<p>For an illustration of the simplicity of this approach, see Dan Cooney's painting "The Simplicity of the Semantic Web". (All rights reserved, used with permission.)</p>

      <p>Toronto, Ontario is coated in ice tonight. A severe winter ice storm slowing the city to a slippery crawl, with widespread power outages. It's a city in crisis.</p>

<p>Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it's a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A tale of two different worlds: One a joke and the other reality: <a href="https://twitter.com/TOMayorFord">@TOMayorFord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TOMayorFrod">@TOMayorFrod</a> The later proving the difference. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23topoli&amp;src=hash">#topoli</a></p>&mdash; The Mason (@Mason5280) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mason5280/statuses/414942641441087490">December 23, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>So, given the need for crisis communications, who do you turn to in a pinch? Hopefully it would be the Mayor, but in the absence of a functioning Mayor, you turn to the Twitter account that pokes fun at the Mayor. @<a href="http://twitter.com/ToMayorFrod">MayorRobFrod</a> has been tweeting out news of power outages, transit service updates, warming centres, flight delays, and other emergency management info. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" title="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The map shows intensity of the ice storm on a scale from 0 (little impact) to 5 (catastrophic damage). The index incorporates measures of rainfall (as ice), wind, and temperatures to come up with an aggregate measure. Washtenaw County's forecast is a 0, but to the north (Livingston) and west (Jackson) counties there are chances for more severe icing. The forecast gives the worst hit to upstate New York along Lake Ontario; alas this map does not show Canadian forecasts, but <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/21/severe-weather-warnings-sweep-across-all-of-central-and-eastern-canada-travel-threatened/">news accounts</a> predict severe weather in Toronto as well.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.</p>

<p>For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. That's why when a proper obituary is written I like to cut and paste it out of wherever it has been and post it here. It seems that unless you do that the words so carefully and lovingly written disappear, either into the unsearchable maw of Facebook or into the tattered yellow clippings of a typical newspaper obituary site. You'll see a few of them in the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/obituaries">obituaries</a> category here.</p>

<p>I've written previously about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/07/facebook-and-obituaries.html">Facebook and obituaries</a>, so this is more a reminder and a capture of a few thoughts than something earth-shakingly new. I have to wonder how the net will evolve over time and whether some hip new service of the moment will transform into something that people use to share their time of grief.</p>

      <p>I use <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> (see: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html">previously</a>) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the projects pile up, and I forget what I was doing but still don't know what to focus on. The mindfulness project then is to go methodically through each of the tabs, dealing with whatever is on that page and then closing the tab instead of saving it. This has been a good way to feel like I don't have an infinite set of half-done efforts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I chose to look at the first 100 images that appeared in a Google image search for “map of Detroit” and overlay the results. Many corporations based in Southfield, Warren, or Dearborn choose to say they are based in “Detroit,” Likewise, most regional organizations (Detroit Chamber, Detroit Water &amp; Sewage, SEMCOG, etc.) represent Detroit with boundaries that extend into surrounding municipalities, most commonly the tri-counties (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb). A number of the 100 maps show urban sprawl to varying degrees while some maps categorize municipalities around the city as “Detroit.” Some maps even included parts of Windsor, Ontario in the “metro Detroit” area. The larger boundaries match the Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as outlined by the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which represent “Detroit” as either a 6 county area (MSA) or a 9 county area (CSA).</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4693">Talking to Vula</a> is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa. The account (which was pointed out to me by Finn Brunton) talks of an inventive use of encrypted text transmitted via analog modem tones recorded to cassette tape and then played back via untraceable pay phones. It's a remarkable tale of late 80s underground crypto, leading up to the release of Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>

<p>From the text, to give you a flavor of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To test this hypothesis I wrote a little program to send some computer output to the modem. Sure enough the sounds came out of the modem`s speaker. These I recorded and played back into the microphone end of the modem while running a communications program on the computer. Eureka! The characters appeared on the screen. I had done with a modem what we were attempting to do with our tone machine.</p>
  
  <p>This seemed to be the real breakthrough. I adapted our encryption program to work with the acoustic modem and recorded the output on a tape recorder. This I took to a public telephone booth and played back to my answering machine. Then I played the answering machine <code>message</code> back into the modem and the computer deciphered it successfully. As the plaintext message appeared on the screen I realised that we had finally discovered an absolutely safe method of communicating with the underground using computers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work originally appeared in a series of six articles in the ANC`s monthly journal Mayibuye from May 1995 to October 1995. </p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/">Mack Collier</a> has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (<a href="http://www.mackcollier.com/how-to-write-awesome-blog-posts/">Here, go read it.</a>) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does.</p>

<p>Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!"  These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. They are not, however, how I write my weblog - and not a style for you, unless you are in a weird job where counting pageviews drives your wages.</p>

<p>The net has enough of the hyperkinetic blog fodder to go around. What it doesn't have, and needs, is bloggers who take an old-school approach to blog writing and who are careful and respectful of their audiences.</p>

<p>Blogging is about writing to pick up an audience, one that would read everything you had to say and comment on it. That means not only writing about what people might click on because their eye got caught by a headline, but also writing the day-in, day-out thematic and topical materials that someone who cares more than a little bit will follow along for detail.</p>

<p>Blogging is figuring out what sorts of regular obscure parts of the world that you cover and being a go-to resource for that issue when it comes up in the world. To illustrate, I bring you Dave Petley's <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog/">Landslide Blog</a>. You won't find awesome stock photography, but you will find a whole series of carefully selected photos that illustrate the stories he writes about landslides and their origin and effect. Or see the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/">Backyard Arthropod Project</a>, which is a lovingly illustrated guide to the bugs of Atlantic Mine, MI with great macrophotography of bugs, beetles, insects, spiders, slugs, and more. There are dozens more like this, people who toil away in relative obscurity writing carefully about their craft, and I love them. It's a style that lends itself to slowly but surely being a recognized expert in your field. </p>

<p>I love weblogs that take a narrow view on some interesting part of the world and are thorough in how they document it. They don't need weird tricks or compelling lists or catchy copy to make their mark on the world. Rather, they illustrate and tell a whole series of stories that might never have been told before, told by someone who is expert in their corner of the world. Even though they might only get a few followers compared to Buzzfeed, they add a lot more to our understanding of the world.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. Each of the pieces that you are writing will need to contemplate a part of the net that might lead to its own distractions.</p>

<p>I am always impressed by people who have the ability to sit down and crank out clean copy that is ready for publication. It's not by any means easy to do this, and certainly every written work can be improved by judicious editing. I'm thinking more of the remarkable skill where you can type as fast as you can for a short burst and have the resulting words make sense, flow nicely, and be worth posting to the world.</p>

<p>The practice I get doing this has a lot to do with blogging, where I want to capture the moment and some momentarily interesting topic and put my mark on it. This is not writing a novel, and not writing a little piece of a 20-page or 400-page non-fiction work; rather, it's somewhere between journalism and blogging. The work you are composing is temporarily interesting to a number of people in part because it has a good headline for Twitter and a body full of words that search engines like. You've written news, but it's within the context of a blog, and because of that it's perfectly acceptable to leave questions unanswered and stories unresolved. It's what musician Michelle Shocked called the "incomplete image", and perhaps you are waiting for someone with a longer deadline to write up the full story.</p>

<p>I know from experience that I can put together 500 words in a sitting on one topic without taking a break and without needing to consult an outline. The much more challenging part is making a long, coherent single narrative out of these intermediate pieces parts. The skill of impromptu essay writing is by no means the same as the skill of book writing, and the task of challenging yourself to come up with a story that moves the current understanding a bit forward is a challenge. </p>

<p>To some degree, I'm willing to pad out those words with ample quotations from other sources, a sort of journalistic cut-and-paste that sifts through less well known sources to string together a story. (Of course the excerpts are carefully hyperlinked to avoid any suggestion of use without attribution.) Careful reuse of existing copy is one of the qualities that blogging can take advantage of that isn't generally OK in journalism circles. </p>

<p>If all you wrote were impromptu essays for the net, you'd quickly find out what was a keeper by the traffic you were able to draw in. On a good day, I'm happy to write three or four blog posts that either satisfy my own interest in preserving a bit of news or that advance some larger story or that answer a question that's on more than one person's mind right now. That would translate into 2000 words on a good day, and that doesn't sound like a lot. I think you'd have to work hard to keep the hopper full of article ideas and to keep up the research that fed a constant stream of ideas to work from, and to work doubly hard to collect the sort of essay-sized chunks that would eventually tell a story that's longer and more carefully planned.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">small wins and writing productivity</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small win is a concrete, complete outcome of moderate importance. By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of small wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to subsequent proposals. A series of small wins is also more structurally sound than a large win because small wins are stable building blocks. Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible results. Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. When a solution is put into place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible. Additional resources flow toward winners, which means that slightly larger wins can be attempted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, rather than think about how hard it would be to produce a book of 80,000 words all in one sitting, it gets a lot easier to think how easy it would be to produce 400 words per day (on a topic of your choice naturally) for 200 days over the course of a year. I can bat out 100 words without thinking about it to answer an email message a dozen times a day. So capturing 80,000 words is simply a matter of doing that in some sensible order and not getting sidetracked by the need for everything to make 100% sense at the very beginning.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A magnitude 4.5 earthquake hit near Edmond, Oklahoma (just north of Oklahoma City) at 12:10 p.m. local time on 7 December 2013. The "did you feel it" map is from the USGS:</p>

<p>In addition, on 8 December 2013 there were several aftershocks, including a <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/us/b000ldn6/us/index.html">magnitude 3.1 quake</a> just after midnight local time.</p>

<p>Reuters has a good overview of the Oklahoma earthquake situation in a November 11, 2013 article by Carey Gillam. Quakes are up sharply in recent years, and the ongoing concern is that they are related to the fracking (hydraulic fracturing) techniques used in the oil and gas industry. From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/19/us-usa-earthquakes-fracking-oklahoma-idUSBRE9AI12W20131119">Reuters</a>: "In Oklahoma, water, fracking - and a swarm of quakes"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seismologist Austin Holland wants to start an earthquake.</p>
  
  <p>From his office a few feet below the earth's surface - a basement at the University of Oklahoma in Norman - Holland, who tracks quakes for the Oklahoma Geological Survey, is digging into a complex riddle: Is a dramatic rise in the size and number of quakes in his state related to oil and gas production activity? And, if so, what can be done to stop it?</p>
  
  <p>As part of his wide-ranging research, Holland is proposing to inject pressurized water into porous rock in an area already known to be earthquake-prone, to see whether injections of oil industry wastewater are contributing to a "swarm" of earthquakes rocking the state.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is a quote from (of all places) the National Plant Diagnostic Network's <a href="http://www.npdn.org/infosec_confidentiality_privacy">handbook on email security</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Information leaks are also a problem with email. Emails are often forwarded beyond the original list of recipients — have you ever received an email from a friend with a confidentiality or copyright notice at the bottom? This is an attempt by your friend’s employer to make sure that confidential information does not get forwarded on to someone who is not supposed to see it. Unfortunately, it is so easy to send email that information spreads beyond what you intend, especially if the information is confidential, classified or newsworthy. Sending out confidential information of any kind in an email can be especially dangerous and costly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a rule, people do send out private and confidential information via email all the time. It's one of the risks we take when engaging in public discourse on a not-too-public mailing list, and it's one of the challenges of balancing convenience with safety. If you had to arrange a dead drop in person to convey information to everyone in your extended circle of friends it would get very tedious very fast.</p>

<p>The problem is particularly challenging when the information is not just confidential but also newsworthy. News tends to leak out (cf. Snowden) in ways that aren't always comfortable to those who have had their confidences betrayed. Even people who should know better - those public officials whose correspondence on official matters is subject to FOIA - protest vigorously when their email is made a matter of public record. Yet we continue on, using open wires and easy-to-forward messages to do our daily business.</p>

      <p>Saturday, 7 December 2013 - ANN ARBOR - It looks like the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">a2gov.org</a> web site is not functioning correctly.</p>

<p>The error behavior is strange, in that every valid page fetched yields a blank page, but if you go to a page that's not valid on the site you get a 404 error (and another blank page).</p>

<p>I don't know if a2gov.org email is also affected. </p>

<p>UPDATE: All systems appear to be functioning correctly again at 3:10p Saturday.</p>

<p>No idea if it will come back.</p>

<p>At the moment, all www.annarbor.com URLs redirect to the MLive Ann Arbor home page.</p>
