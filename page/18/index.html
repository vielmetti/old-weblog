<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>A letter from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Yousef_Rabhi">Yousef Rabhi</a> regarding the homeless, and the response to the storm by Washtenaw County; reproduced with permission. All hyperlinks go to <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> pages, which should have more detail and explanations.</p>

<p><br/> </p>

<p>FYI: I discussed this issue with the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Snow_emergency">Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council</a> and options were discussed. County government has been mobilized to do our part to ensure that members of our community that are homeless are able to keep warm over the next few days.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> is working with <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Delonis_Center">Delonis</a> to ensure that we find space for additional individuals. From my understanding, additional capacity was made available today. Another concern that has been raised is that some members of the homeless community are not able to pass a breathalyzer test and so will not be admitted to the Delonis Warming Shelter. Due to the severity of the predicted cold, it appears that Delonis will be more lenient with this policy.  </p>

<p>The County's <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">Project Outreach Team</a> has been delivering sleeping bags, and other warming materials to individuals that are camping outside tonight. Through site visits and other methods, they have established an accounting of individuals that are sleeping outside and their needs. For those that do not have access to warming at the Delonis Center, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a> has offered accommodations to house those individuals and keep them warm.</p>

<p>Public Health is also working with their Emergency Officer to respond to public health concerns as they arise. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Washtenaw_County_Public_Health">Public Health</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/PORT">PORT</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/CSTS">Community Support and Treatment Services</a> and The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development">Office of Community and Economic Development</a> have been working around the clock to ensure that folks stay warm tonight. With the cold setting in, we must remain vigilant to ensure that no one falls though the cracks. If anyone hears of any issues of people being turned away from the warming center, please contact me. We will ensure that resources are available to help those that need warmth. </p>

<p>Thank you all for your concern on this matter. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>From email sent by Ann Arbor City Council member <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Christopher_Taylor">Christopher Taylor</a> (D-3d Ward).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>Here is a quick update for you about the snow and the City’s response.</p>

<p>As of 9:00 pm, we have had 11+ inches of snow. We have not declared a formal snow emergency and street parking is unrestricted. </p>

<p>All City facilities will be open Monday and trash collection will run on its ordinary schedule. </p>

<p>Road crews are out working 12 – 14 hour shifts. The day shift had 14 trucks assigned to Major roadways until noon, then dropped down to 12 trucks to accommodate schedule changes necessary to bolster the night shift.  Our night shift began at 6pm with a regular staff of 14 trucks assigned to Majors. The Major road staff will start using sand/salt mix around midnight. Additional staff will be assigned to work on locals during the night.  Local plowing will begin with Monday and Tuesday trash collection routes, and then continue throughout the City.  </p>

<p>The Snow Desk (994-SNOW) will be staffed 7am - 11pm thru Wednesday to answer resident questions and to report concerns.</p>

<p>As ever, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Stay warm and if you must travel, drive carefully.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Christopher Taylor</p>

      <p>This is current as of January 4, 2014. Check on the <a href="http://library.municode.com/HTML/11782/level3/TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC.html#TITXTR_CH126TR_ARTXIAC_10_143SNEM">Municode</a> web site for the absolute latest information, though it's unlikely that the ordinance will change.</p>

<p>Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a "Snow Condition Yellow". From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheCityOfAnnArbor">City of Ann Arbor Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets. Moving your car will also keep it from being plowed in with snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A snow emergency declared on Dec. 25-26, 2002, but City Council voted in Jan. 6, 2003 to waive or reduce fines from tickets issued during that event; this <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/03/02/monthly-milestone-institutional-memory/">according to the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>.</p>

<p>10:143. Snow emergencies.</p>

<p>(1)
Prohibited parking for snow removal.</p>

<p>(a)
Whenever the City Administrator finds, on the basis of snow, sleet, freezing rain, or on the basis of a weather forecast, that weather conditions make it necessary to restrict parking to allow removal of existing or forecasted snow, the Administrator may declare a snow emergency and put in effect an odd/even parking prohibition on some or all city streets by providing notice of the prohibition in the manner prescribed by this section.</p>

<p>(b)
When an odd/even parking prohibition is in effect, no person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle owned by him or her to remain parked on the following described portions of any street; provided, however, that the parking prohibition of this subsection does not apply during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that vehicles can be positioned to comply with the next day's prohibition.</p>

<p>(i)
On days having uneven dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having even street addresses.</p>

<p>(ii)
On days having even dates, vehicles are prohibited from parking on the side of the street having uneven street addresses.</p>

<p>(2)
Notice.</p>

<p>(a)
The prohibitions provided in this section shall take effect when the Administrator causes notice of such prohibitions to be publicly announced by radio stations, Community Television Network and any other suitable media outlet with normal operating ranges covering the city. The prohibitions shall then take effect at the time provided in the announcement. The Administrator may also cause notice of the parking prohibition to be published in newspapers of general circulation when feasible.</p>

<p>(b)
The parking prohibitions provided by this section shall remain in effect until the Administrator makes a public announcement of the termination of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>(3)
Nothing contained in this section permits parking at times or places where it is otherwise prohibited by this Code.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 48-01, § 3, 11-19-01; Ord. No. 38-02, § 1, 10-21-02; Ord. No. 2-03, § 1, 2-18-03)</p>

<p>For January 2-3 2014 we are looking at a wind chill advisory for the Ann Arbor area with wind chills going all the way past 15 below F. From the <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=dtx&amp;storyid=99316&amp;source=0">NWS Detroit</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cold overnight temperatures in the single digits below zero will combine with 10 to 15 mph winds to cause dangerous Wind Chill Values of -17 to -23 across all of southeast Michigan.  A Wind Chill Advisory has been issued for all of southeast Michigan Tonight through Friday Morning.</p>

<p>On the Ann Arbor Public Schools site, there's a <a href="http://www.a2schools.org/aaps/schools/school_safety">wind chill chart</a> that shows you the combination of wind and cold that sets school policy for indoor recess and for canceling school. Mind you that school doesn't start until Monday January 6 2014.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On days when the temperature and/or wind chill are below 0ºF:</p>
  
  <p>Students will not have recess outside</p>
  
  <p>On days when the temperature and/or wind chill are below -20ºF (20 below zero):</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This simple dish of beans and greens comes from Mary Ann Esposito's <a href="http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2221/broccoli-rabe-with-white-beans">Ciao Italia</a>. It's similar in many ways to the traditional "Hoppin' John" served for good luck for the new year.</p>

<h2>Hoppin' Giovanni</h2>

<p>Wash and chop a bunch of rapini (broccoli rabe). If you can't find rapini, some other mild green like turnip greens (or even kale) would work nicely.</p>

<p>Mince a shallot fine and saute in a large pan in olive oil until fragrant. Add a few generous pinches of red pepper flakes. Put the chopped rapini into the pan and cook until the greens are cooked through.</p>

<p>Drain and rinse a can of white beans (cannellini). When the greens are cooked through, add the beans and stir. You can add a little more olive oil to the pan at this point if you want to. Stir and then bring back up to heat.</p>

<p>Serve hot. This would go good with pasta.</p>

      <p>I'm thinning out my todo list for the new year to delete some of the oldest items, the ones that aren't particularly hard but they also haven't been done this past year.</p>

<p>I figure that if I need to do them, the opportunity will arise again, and it might be easier to get them done if they show up fresh at the top of the list rather than buried at the bottom.</p>

<p>What's humorous (or sad) is the items marked "urgent" that are more than a week old; clearly, simply marking something as urgent does not stand in for actually doing the work.</p>

<p>Ah, new year's productivity !</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yup, thinning out the list is now a perpetual activity; I'm trying to keep work in progress under about 30 tasks. There may be more to do in the world, you think? I can only keep track of so much of it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Kai Petainen writes that the downtown "Library Lot" parking structure so full on New Years Eve that when everyone went to leave it at once, the lines were so long that people's paid tickets ran out of time. This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay.</p>

<p>I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events. I look forward to a postmortem on this at the next <a href="http://www.a2dda.org">Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority</a> board meeting, January 8, 2014 at noon.</p>

The toxic plume of smoke from the fire has led to evacuations of the city, which is 25 miles west of Fargo.

      </h3>
      <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy
of something I've already written and published somewhere else.
That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by
googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into
the ether too quickly (including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ourfounder/posts/10152097845036826">this thread</a> which will die quietly
when we are all done with it).</p>

<p>Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really
provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic
discussion. Rather, they bias towards the moderator's interests,
because only the posts from the moderator are visible for long
enough to get any traffic.</p>

<p>The problem of how to build forum software is old and solved. The
MTS Confer system and others that followed it like Picospan and <a href="http://www.caucus.com">Caucus</a>
lived in a world where you could create a long-running discussion
that focused on one topic and where you could keep that topic mostly
on-topic over an extended period of time. Facebook, in contrast, 
feels more like a big chat room, where yesterday's posts scroll off
into nothingness and where you can't get back to any discussion you
once had - no matter how good it was.</p>

<p>Twitter doesn't give you the paragraph-sized chunks of discussion that
you need to actually have an intelligent conversation, but it does 
have long-lived hashtags that enable a community of interest to form
and (with scheduled chats) thrive. It's possible to find people who
you don't know who share an interest and to communicate with them in
such a way that a simple enough search brings back something useful.
Nothing on Facebook behaves that way.</p>

and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting
outages as well as citizens would have them do. </p>

<p>The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL,
the <a href="http://www.lbwl.com/">Lansing Board of Water and Light</a>. Even though the surrounding
area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly
encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing,
LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively 
unusual in this day and age.</p>

<p>The map below is a crowd-sourced tracking of outages and
restorations in the Lansing area. It's been put together
under the lead of @<a href="http://twitter.com/jsiarto">jsiarto</a> (Jeff Siarto) with the help of
other Lansing area residents and with data pulled in part from
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LansingBWL">LBWL Facebook page</a>.</p>

  <p>Unlike Consumers Energy and DTE, Lansing Board of Water and Light doesn't have a real time outage map for customers, but it's something the company is currently developing, according to company spokesperson Steve Serkaian.</p>
  
  <p>"We're working on a "smart grid" system that's similar to what other utilities offer, but it's something that costs a significant amount of money to implement," he said. "But we have heard our customers loud and clear and we're committed to working on communicating with them better."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(BWL General Manager J. Peter Lark) said BWL is running at “optimum” staffing levels. On Friday, he said, 30 crews were on the ground, a figure that includes 12 line crews and five tree-trimming crews. Crews are made up of two or three people, with most line crews using three.
  The utility to date has brought in outside help from five other municipally owned utilities, but Lark said Friday he doesn’t plan to bring in more — at least one BWL employee would have to ride with the outside crew, and that would reduce the number of BWL crews in operation.</p>

  <p>Most of those still without power are customers of Lansing’s public utility. Angry customers showed up at a company press conference yesterday to complain about the slow repairs. The number of Lansing Board of Water and Light customers without power actually increased yesterday as melting ice from tree limbs damaged more power lines.</p>

When will the community return to normal? When will the powers-that-be get their act together so people can make wise choices? Temperatures are expected to plunge into single digits tonight. What should people whose power is out do now? Move their families, especially the elderly and infirm, to other locations? Can people with pets still take them to the Ingham County Animal Shelter? When will those who should have the answers start communicating effectively?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This delicious lentil, feta, and olive pasta salad is adapted from the cookbook <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/best-125-meatless-pasta-dishes/oclc/24375167">The Best 125 Meatless Pasta Dishes</a> by <a href="http://mindycooks.blogspot.com/">Mindy Toomay</a> and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/author/geiskopfhadlersusann">Susann Geiskopf-Hadler</a>, published by <a href="http://www.bookbusinessmag.com/article/setting-the-pace-prima-publishing-12266/1">Prima Publishing</a> in 1992.</p>

<p>Add 3 cups of water to 1.5 cups of lentils in a saucepan on the stove. Add 2 bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then cook 25-35 minutes until the lentils are done. Rinse under cold water and drain. Note: you'll want lentils that hold their shape in cooking; look for French lentils or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/855532">lentils du Puy</a> in the bulk section of your favorite grocer.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, chop vegetables. Note that all vegetables are to be chopped small, so that they are not that much bigger than the lentils. For the vegetables:</p>

<ul>
<li>one bell pepper, green or red</li>
<li>1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted of course</li>
</ul>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, wash a bunch of parsley, and run it through the food processor until it is chopped very fine.</p>

<p>While the lentils are cooking, make a salad dressing, which is a nice garlicky vinaigrette.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
<li>2 medium cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced fine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Near the end of the lentil cooking time, put on pasta to cook. </p>

<p>Just before serving, dice or crumble some feta and put it into a separate bowl, in the case that you have dinner guests who don't care for feta.</p>

<p>Get a large bowl, and mix the lentils, vegetables, parsley, and dressing together in it.</p>

<p>Very delicious. Serve at room temperature.</p>

<p>Prep time - 45 to 60 minutes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.</p>

<p>In the winter months it's harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it's warm. That all said, there's no less need to be mindful of how much exercise you are getting when it's cold out.</p>

<p>In days past, I was able to predict my mood rather accurately by checking how many steps I got on my pedometer. If the number was below 5000 you could count on me to be grouchy, and those rare days when the count exceeded 20000 were days when I couldn't concentrate on much of anything except moving. There's a seasonally adjusted optimum of approximately 10000 steps - minus a few in winter, plus a few in summer - that I think of as a target that if I happen to move that much in a day that everything else works out OK.</p>

<p>I've used <a href="http://www.walkertracker.com">Walker Tracker</a> on and off since 2006, or so the stats tell me, and in that time I've logged over 7 million steps. Though the site interface has changed a little bit and my old crowd of fellow pedestrians has mostly moved on from the site, there are still a few familiar faces of people more industrious than I am in logging their activity. I'm looking forward to revisiting it and being a bit more diligent about getting out and about in the winter time.</p>

<p>Note to self: buy new mittens, ideally ones that let me have at least one index finger free to work my phone.</p>

<p>Note to self 2: the battery is said to last 6 months, whether you use the system or not, so be prepared to change it on the summer solstice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite".</p>

<p>The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. Because the Twitter writing environment is so spare, it's relatively easy to produce something or react to something in a way that doesn't require a fully formed idea or any of the other agonies that accompany longer format writing.</p>

<p>Here is a recipe for writing more in this blog. Don't worry about how much you tweet, because you are treating those tweets as the short form of your work. When the muse is silent, go back to your own tweets and see which ones of them deserve to be longer. Even the stereotypical "eating a sandwich" tweet can be stretched into 200 words if you want, by turning that throwaway observation into a recipe. Almost anything worth visiting in 140 characters is worth revisiting in longer form; take advantage of the short form as a stockpile of ideas to pull from when it's time to write longer.</p>

<p>Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It's distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!</p>

<p>Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated. Case in point, a <a href="http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html">hack of Dogewallet</a> caused several people's stash of Dogecoins to vanish into the hands of an as of yet unknown person who managed to get to the file system of the Dogewallet "secure" system and change the destination address for Dogecoin transfers. About 30 million coins were stolen.</p>

<ul>
<li>2 lbs sweet potatoes, boiled 7 minutes, peeled, cut into 1" chunks</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 lime</li>
<li>juice of 1/2 orange</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>2 tsp chipotle chili powder</li>
<li>2 cans (15 oz each) of black beans, rinsed well and drained</li>
<li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
<li>1 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a dressing of the olive oil, lime juice, orange juice, cumin, chipotle powder; mix well.</p>

<p>Combine the ingredients in a large bowl. I put half the sweet potatoes at the bottom, then one can of beans, then more sweet potatoes, then more beans, with green onions and cilantro at the top. Pour the dressing over and mix.</p>

<p>This works well the next day as leftovers, if you have any!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unocha.org/south-sudan/">UNOCHA South Sudan</a> describes the displaced persons in South Sudan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.</p>

<p>Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers.</p>

<p>A useful mechanism of self-guidance for me is to ensure that every post fits into at least one existing category. It doesn't help that I have to date created <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/archives.html">two hundred and thirty eight categories</a> into which something might fit. That at least is honest; this weblog doesn't have one narrow focus, and it's been running for ten years, so some divergence of interests is not just anticipated but expected.</p>

<p>For an illustration of the simplicity of this approach, see Dan Cooney's painting "The Simplicity of the Semantic Web". (All rights reserved, used with permission.)</p>

      <p>Toronto, Ontario is coated in ice tonight. A severe winter ice storm slowing the city to a slippery crawl, with widespread power outages. It's a city in crisis.</p>

<p>Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it's a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A tale of two different worlds: One a joke and the other reality: <a href="https://twitter.com/TOMayorFord">@TOMayorFord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TOMayorFrod">@TOMayorFrod</a> The later proving the difference. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23topoli&amp;src=hash">#topoli</a></p>&mdash; The Mason (@Mason5280) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mason5280/statuses/414942641441087490">December 23, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>So, given the need for crisis communications, who do you turn to in a pinch? Hopefully it would be the Mayor, but in the absence of a functioning Mayor, you turn to the Twitter account that pokes fun at the Mayor. @<a href="http://twitter.com/ToMayorFrod">MayorRobFrod</a> has been tweeting out news of power outages, transit service updates, warming centres, flight delays, and other emergency management info. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" title="Spia-index-2013-12-21-22-wfoNE_USSPIAMax" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b036cc601970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>The map shows intensity of the ice storm on a scale from 0 (little impact) to 5 (catastrophic damage). The index incorporates measures of rainfall (as ice), wind, and temperatures to come up with an aggregate measure. Washtenaw County's forecast is a 0, but to the north (Livingston) and west (Jackson) counties there are chances for more severe icing. The forecast gives the worst hit to upstate New York along Lake Ontario; alas this map does not show Canadian forecasts, but <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/21/severe-weather-warnings-sweep-across-all-of-central-and-eastern-canada-travel-threatened/">news accounts</a> predict severe weather in Toronto as well.</p>
