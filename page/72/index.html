<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Webshots contributor "candistackable" has a <a href="http://travel.webshots.com/album/171362932DUOqVQ">photo album of Michigan wild blueberry picking</a> from 2004.  </p>

<blockquote>
In our part of Michigan (Topinabee) the woods are thick with wild blueberries toward the end of July and the beginning of August. I hope you enjoy my images.
</blockquote>

<p>There's lots of pictures, and lots of comments on the pictures, including this one from "jrgoflo":</p>

<blockquote>
I loved these pictures. There's really nothing better than Wild Michigan blueberries. My favorite place to pick them is at the Shelldrake Dam State Forest Campground NW of Paradise in the U.P. or the Betsy Lake area of Tahquamenon Falls State Park. I've just planted 10 lowbush blueberry shrubs at my house. Can't wait!!

      <p><a href="http://www.crosscut.com/lifestyle-leisure/16081/">Geri Larkin writes in Crosscut Seattle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The book <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/2908575">Plenty</a> is about a young Vancouver couple, Alisa Smith and J.B. Mackinnon. The two decide to live on locally grown foods for a year. I've just read to the section on blueberries where they find a patch of beautiful, fat juicy ones only to discover that they are being grown for a local Buddhist temple and are not for sale. I don't know, yet, if they talk their way into a sale. Given how personable the couple is, my guess is probably. Putting the book down to attend to chores, I've realized that Smith and Mackinnon have convinced me to seriously consider following their eat-local example.
</blockquote>

<p>I'll note that the LibraryThing tag cloud for this book includes the tag "read and returned" (!)</p>

<p>Here's a recipe from that article:</p>

<h3>Buddha's Blueberry Bread Pudding</h3>

<p>4 cups of just about any kind (maybe not dark rye) of bread chunks, an inch or two in size, mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter or canola oil</p>

<p>2-3 cups of blueberries (You can decide how much you can bear to cook as opposed to eat raw.)</p>

<p>3 eggs</p>

<p>2 tsp. of ground cinnamon</p>

<p>1 1/2 cups of almost hot water</p>

<p>1 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk (The condensed part matters.)</p>

<p>1/4 cup of melted butter or oil</p>

<p>3 teaspoons of vanilla</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the bread chunks into a greased, 9-inch baking pan. Square works best, but whatever you have will probably work. Sometimes I use two bread baking pans. Sprinkle the berries over the bread.</p>

<p>In a big bowl, stir up the eggs, then add all the other remaining ingredients. Stir for a minute or two and then pour the mixture over the bread and blueberries. Bake about 45 minutes or until a knife stuck into the center comes out clean or mostly clean.</p>

<p>Try not to eat the pudding straight out of the oven because it will burn the top of your mouth. If you do anyway, your mouth will feel much better by tomorrow.</p>

      <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS</p>

<p>By John Clark</p>

<p>My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I raked blueberries for several years, never getting particularly skillful at it, but earning enough to buy my school clothes and supplies every fall. Along the way, I discovered the itchy and painful bite of brown field spiders and that not all hornets nest in trees. I even watched, bemused as a dozen teenagers ran whooping and hollering after a curious bear that had followed our truck down a woods road from a remote blueberry field.</p>

      <p>At one point I had <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/telegraph">a whole blog devoted to collecting information about the telegraph</a>; it's still there, but dormant.  Ah, passing interests.</p>

<p>Along the way, I got this suggestion, which I share:<br />
<blockquote><br />
"If you're looking for "telegraph literature" (i.e. stories involving telegraphs) then you should certainly read "<a href="http://www.jimandellen.org/trollope/telegraphgirl.html">The Telegraph Girl</a>" by Anthony Trollope and an accompanying article "<a href="http://www.jimandellen.org/trollope/nonfiction.TelegraphGirls.html">The Young Women at the London Telegraph Office</a>" and then Kipling's story "<a href="http://www.benlo.com/ham/wireless.html">Wireless</a>."  "<br />

<p>There is certainly more, which I may add to here from time to time, suggestions welcomed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From time to time people ask questions about Ann Arbor, and from time to time there are what appear to be encyclopedic responses to them.  Part of the reason for this is <a href="http://Arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a>, a wiki that covers information about Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Washtenaw County and the rest of the area.</p>

<p><a href="http://matth.org/">Matt Hampel</a> runs this with an ad hoc collective doing editorial direction and the Ann Arbor District Library providing hosting. It's not advertising driven, and while is has a lot of information about businesses any obviously marketing copy gets edited out pretty quickly.  I use it to do everything from keeping track of where black raspberries are available for picking in parks to noting <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Birthday_Deals">which Ann Arbor restaurants give great deals on your birthday (</a>the most popular page on the site).</p>

<p>Matt recently sent out a call for contributions for the site for one infrastructure expense not otherwise covered, domain registration.  I'm happy to say that within a few days he raised enough to renew arborwiki.org for 10 years, and to leave a little bit left over for printing stickers.  (because, as you well know, any real project generates stickers.)  </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/">making fruit liqueurs, (or) how to prepare for the holidays well in advance</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's fruit season (or nearly so) and so it's time to start thinking about what we're going to do for making holiday gifts.  One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy.</p>

<p>We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it.</p>

<p>Some minimal collection of things to help for this year, one fruit at a time; not exhaustive, but maybe it will help jump start next year.  Ordered in rough order of appearance of the fruit here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strawberry liqueur.  <a href="http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=750">Irene's Strawberry liqueur</a> from The Cottage Smallholder; noting that "There’s nothing like the distraction of homemade grog when times are getting tough."
<li>Juneberry liqueur.  <a href="http://forums.farm-garden.com/viewtopic.php?id=1056">Saskatoons go with gin</a>, says contributor "prairiemaid" from Manitoba.
<li>Gooseberry liqueur.  In the 1930s, <a href="http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/GuidesToCollections/MeltisofBedford.aspx">Meltis of Bedford</a> introduced a gooseberry liqueur sweet to the UK market which was a big success, so they say.    Read Anton Chekov's <a href="http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html">Gooseberries</a>.  I don't have a recipe.
<li>Currants.  Make cassis; here's a <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/labruscagrape/2005-June/000296.html">cassis recipe</a>, from " The Cook and the Gardener" by Amanda Hesser, A Year of Recipes and Writings from the French Countryside.
<li>Blueberries.  Freeze the berries first, then make <a href="http://www.guntheranderson.com/liqueurs/blueber0.htm">blueberry liqueur.</a>.  Ex-Michigander <a href="http://culinariaeugenius.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/my-staples-summer-blueberry-liqueur/">Culinaria Eugenius</a> has a photo of the red-purple liquid that results.  
</ul>

<p>Enough for now.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-one-web-day-is/">One Web Day is September 22</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://onewebday.org/">One Web Day is September 22</a>; University of Michigan Law professor <a href="http://scrawford.net/blog/">Susan Crawford</a> is organizing it, with events and participation from around the world.  It's "Earth Day for the Internet".</p>

<blockquote>
Around the world, we're focusing attention on the importance of the internet to political participation -
that's this year's theme.  We're also encouraging people to talk about (and do something about) internet issues they're worried about - censorship, the digital divide, inadequate connectivity generally.  The idea behind OneWebDay is to create a platform for a global constituency that cares about the future of the internet. 
</blockquote>

<p>The piece of this that I have an abiding interest in is access to the Internet in public places; the development of business practices, community efforts, and municipal and library systems that provide some level of public computing and communications infrastructure that is not tied to a monthly fee from an Internet service provider.</p>

<p>There's a large number of businesses, usually cafes and restaurants but also laundromats, supermarkets, and ice cream shops, where the proprietors can see a narrow self-interest in providing free network access to anyone who brings a computer and buys their daily aliquot of caffeine or sugar.   This is an essential part of civic information infrastructure, because rather than being planned centrally by some committee, it just happens.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, the free access comes with strings, most notably in my experience the existence of badly designed or configured firewalls that block access to perfectly reasonable web sites or tools.  This failure is a market failure if there are enough alternatives - you walk down the street to the next cafe if it bugs you enough - but you can only route around censorship if you have an alternative.   If the web access is really bad, I just don't go back.</p>

<p>Centrally planned civic internets have been a failure around Ann Arbor; the much-ballyhooed Wireless Washtenaw has never developed either enough critical mass or enough ubiquity of coverage to justify its fees for service.  Despite an advisory board that included every township supervisor who wanted to be part of it, it's not part of the answer to universal free web access.  In contrast, the privately funded Wireless Ypsi, which uses Meraki hardware in a mesh configuration, has hit enough of the business districts of Ypsilanti to make internet ubiquitous there, without the need for anything more than some effort and coordinating about how it's done.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>If you have enough density of people online, networks start to get used for political participation and political action.  Ann Arbor has been online in one form or another since Bob Parnes's CONFER and Marcus Watts's Picospan of the 1970s, so we have some experience with this, and elected officials who have been on the net as long as there has been a net to be on.</p>

<p>If all politics is local, then there is nothing more political than the local neighborhood mailing list, the group of 15-50 individuals in close proximity who all hear the same loud construction noise or see the same contractor getting hassled by the city and can mobilize in a density and coordination of action that gets attention and results.  Here the universal access level that gets things done depends on older, lower tech, pre web coordination tools - the individual who has that email list and who can write the call to action to get attention or get things done.  In all cases I've seen that work people reuse and repurpose existing free or ad-supported tools to manage these.</p>

<p>Every so often, issues leave the neighborhood level and appear in public.  If you are lucky, you have a great newspaper, but great newspapers are hard to come by.  Even without a great print newspaper, it's entirely possible to have a really good civic news site, one which is resourceful enough to post city council meeting agendas and to get city council members to post under their own names, or one that sustains a distinctive perspective on town long enough to generate meetings which are offline and not just online.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>With this context in place, I see the digital divide as an opportunity.</p>

<p>Calling it a digital divide simply emphasizes that there is a divide - that the neighborhood of West Willow is different from the village of Manchester, and that there may not be much reason for those two groups of people to work together for collective action without some external impetus that seeks to weave them together.</p>

<p>In every community and economy there are holes, opportunities unrealized because people just don't know that what they are looking for is there.  The analog divide is even larger than the digital divide, and maybe (just maybe) when we realize that we can start to build practices that address that.</p>

<p>It's just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.</p>

<p>There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor.  The <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm.  <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/07/dexter-blueberr.html">Last year they charged $1.35 per pound for U-Pick</a>, and it was easy to fill a five pound bucket in a single session.</p>

<p>Note that the Main Street Bridge through Dexter is closed to eastbound traffic, so if you are heading back to Ann Arbor you'll go around downtown Dexter.  See the <a href="http://www.villageofdexter.org/">Village of Dexter web site</a> for details and a construction webcam.</p>

<p>Slightly farther away is <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/The_Blueberry_Patch">The Blueberry Patch</a> in Grass Lake, just east of Jackson.  The berries are organic, and they use nets to keep away the birds.</p>

<p>The other part of the state where I know a bit of detail is in the southwestern corner (known as Michiana) near New Buffalo, MI, Michigan City IN and the surrounding area.  I scanned in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/1225078024/">list of Michiana blueberry picking farms</a> when we were there last year, and that info should still be good.  It's the closest Michigan berrypicking you'll get if you're coming from Chicagoland.</p>

<p>Leduc Blueberries near Kalamazoo has <a href="http://www.leducblueberries.com/extra.iml">a collection of eight years worth of annual blueberry recipes</a> (PDF), which include the usual bakes, crumbles, pies and the like plus a series of dinner salads like a <a href="http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&controller=article&category_id=157&article=18460">blueberry lemon chicken salad</a>.</p>

<p>Other blueberry crop news:</p>

<p>A report from Hammonton, New Jersey predicts an <a href="http://www.thehammontonnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/LIFESTYLE/806250307/1024/NEWS17">average New Jersey blueberry crop for 2008</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
"The hot weather that we've been having has had some effects on the ripening and harvesting of our products, though the cooler-than-normal ground temperatures and, until recently, cool overnight temperatures have helped to somewhat mitigate the day heat," said William Walker of the New Jersey Department Agriculture's Jersey Fresh program. "The season was slow to begin, but we're now on a normal production schedule."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>DeGrandchamp Farms predicts a good 2008 season:<br />
<blockquote><br />
As I write this article, the 2008 blueberry crop looks like it has the potential to be an excellent one. I believe a lot has to do with the excellent growing season last summer which produced good growth and bud set. </p>

<p>Wholesale prices for the fresh market were strong last year and should continue for the 2008 season. Demand for blueberries is strong for the processing market as more manufacturers are using blueberries in their product lines. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CropValuSu/CropValuSu-02-14-2008.txt">USDA crop price report</a> for the last three years for blueberries:<br/>
2005: $1.44/lb<br />
2006: $1.76/lb        <br />
2007: $1.83/lb </p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/ready-to-pick-michigan-blueberries/">Absolute Michigan has a Ready To Pick feature on blueberries</a> with recipes and crop and grower info.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for in comments:</p>

<p>Have you gone blueberry picking recently, and how was it?<br />
Where do you go wild (not cultivated) berry picking - if not precisely where, then at least the township?<br />
What do you know about mechanical blueberry harvesters?<br />
Have you ever used a blueberry rake, and is it easy to make one out of ordinary materials by hand?<br />
What are your favorite blueberry recipes?<br />
How do you preserve blueberries for February in Michigan when it's gray all the time?<br />
What varieties of blueberry are good for growing in your yard, and what soil do you need?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every once in a long while, you run across something so wonderful you have to share.</p>

<p>I have been tracking hits to the Google search <a href="http://google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders">Michigan spiders</a>, ever since an odd combination of page text about automated web browsing tools unearthed a bunch of folks trying to identify the spiders crawling across their day lilies.</p>

<p>Today's search logs turned up this amazing resource, the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com">The Backyard Arthropod Project<br />
A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI</a>.  The author writes:<br />
<blockquote><br />
This started out as a typical ranting blog over on Livejournal, but it turns out that, overall, I’m a happy sort of guy and don’t really have that many things to rant about. As of February 2007, it has instead turned into a project to document every arthropod that I can find on our property (about 9 acres on the north slope of Old Mill Hill in the Keeweenaw Peninsula of Upper Michigan). This includes insects, spiders, other arachnids, crustaceans, and pretty much anything I find with an exoskeleton. There should be at least one new arthropod every week, for as long as the variety holds out (which could be years). I’ll also randomly inject whatever thoughts happen to occur to me at the time, although I’ll try to stick with at least some connection to the topic at hand. When I run out of arthropods, maybe I’ll start in on the plants.</p>

<p>While I have always been interested in insects and other arthropods, I unfortunately have zero formal training in entomology (I am an extractive metallurgist by profession), so I’m basically trying to learn arthropod taxonomy as I go. I will doubtless make many mistakes, please don’t hesitate to correct me when I am wrong.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Go, look.  There are pictures, there are bugs - arachnids, isopods, diptera, cutworm moths, crickets, katydids.  There are tags: <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-house/">found in house</a> and <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/tag/found-in-yard/">found in yard</a> stand in equal prominence.  9 acres in the UP yields plenty of bugs, in season, and season is year-round, as the presence of the <a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/2008/01/19/snow-fly/">snow fly - Chionea valga</a> will attest.</p>

<p>This is why people live in the UP!  Bugs, all with Latin names!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-26-kilowatts-per-t/">kilowatts per terabyte, or terabytes per kilowatt: a measure of storage energy efficiency</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A measure of the efficiency of data storage; the equivalent would be W/GB (watts per gigabyte).</p>

<p>The range measured below is 0.4 TB/KW (RAM) to 500 TB/KW (Blu-ray disks), with a corresponding range in access speed and update times.</p>

<p>Some estimates or measures:</p>

<p>If you are using solid state memory (no disk; just memory, configured as disk) from <a href="http://www.superssd.com/products/tera-ramsan/">Texas Memory Systems</a>, expect to have 2.5 KW/TB, or 0.4 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The Tera-RamSan incorporates specially designed 4-Gbit Fibre Channel or 4x InfiniBand interfaces that include performance-enhancing hardware to reduce I/O latency to under 14 microseconds. With I/O requests being served so quickly, an order-of-magnitude more requests per second are executed by a single Tera-RamSan interface as compared to other Fibre Channel interfaces. By scaling SSD modules up to 8 units (8 Fibre Channel links per unit or 4 InfiniBand links per unit), the Tera-RamSan is the ultimate storage solution for high-performance applications in total IOPS and total bandwidth. Also, because the Tera-RamSan is DDRRAM based, there is NO penalty for RANDOM accesses. Data requests need not be tuned for performance. User access time is not compromised, even if tens of thousands of users access the system simultaneously. Extreme performance is the key feature of the Tera-RamSan.  <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html">From 2005, Pierre Devries: including cooling</a> about 1 KW/TB, or 1 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Working off Barroso, Dean and Hölzle’s paper on the Google cluster architecture, I infer that the energy consumption for storage is approximately 1W/GB: a dual 1.4-GHz Intel Pentium III server with a two 80GB drives draws 120W per server. Adding Google’s estimate of about 40% for cooling, gives 165 W per 160 GB, or 1 W/GB (watt/gigabyte). <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>in the <a href="http://deepfreeze9.blogspot.com/2005/06/tonne-per-terabyte.html?showComment=1120610880000#c112061093215420698">comments to that post</a>, using the archive.org architecture: 50W/TB, or 20 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Capricorn tech clains that their Petabox storage, which they built for archive.org, runs as little as 50W/TB. I don't think that number includes the power consumption of the required air conditioning.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>updating <a href="http://www.capricorn-tech.com/products.php">Capricorn's Petabox to the current (2008) web site</a>, we see 27W/TB, or 37 TB/KW:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The PetaBox is completely scalable, from individual terabyte nodes to petabyte clusters. A single 19-inch rack can support up to 120TB of raw disk space. This density is achieved through an economy of design that consumes as little as 27 watts per terabyte.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/03/23/222467/solving-storage-power-and-cooling-concerns.htm">Computer Weekly in 2007</a> talks about metrics but doesn't actually measure:<br />
<blockquote><br />
An individual drive uses 5W to 15W of power depending on its capacity, rotation speed, form factor and operating state, but "you can't just multiply the number of drives in an array by some average power rating to get a total," says Mark Greenlaw, senior director with storage marketing at EMC. The power consumption of the array is more than the sum of the power used by the individual drives. Controllers and other components consume power. Copan Systems proposes two metrics for archival data storage: storage density measured in terabytes per square foot and terabytes per kilowatt.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.copansystems.com/news/press_releases.php?press_id=64">A COPAN Systems press release from 2007</a>; naturally, take press releases for what they are worth.  The range from 4 TB/KW (Fibre Channel), 17 TB/KW (SATA), and 100 TB/KW (COPAN's sooper stuffs):<br />
<blockquote><br />
COPAN Systems has taken a "revolutionary" approach in how it has engineered its products over the past 4 years to deal with power and cooling issues in the data center. The low power requirements of COPAN's enhanced MAID architecture integrated with the extremely large storage density delivers in excess of an impressive 100 terabyte (TB) per kilowatt, the highest in the industry. This compares to an average power density for Fibre Channel disk products of approximately 4 TB per kilowatt and an average rate for standard SATA disk products of 17 TB per kilowatt. The savings are significant with estimates for power and cooling savings between $5.7 million and $7.8 million over a four year time period.<br />
</blockquote><br />
MAID, or "massive array of idle disks", if you don't know it, is an architecture where the drives are usually powered down; you wouldn't use it for active hot storage, but for mostly offline stuff it's a possible solution.</p>

<p>For the weird, here's a read-mostly solution: a <a href="http://powerfile.com/">Powerfile</a> array of Blu-ray optical drives, at 500 TB/KW.<br />

      <p>via the <a href="http://www.sovlit.com/bios/mayakovsky.html">V. V. Mayakovsky bio in the Encyclopedia of Soviet Authors</a>:</p>

<p>In 1925 Mayakovsky also made one of his few forays into the sphere of utopian science fiction with his poem Letaiushchi Proletarii ("The Flying Proletarian"). As described by Victor Tarras in his biography of Mayakovsky, The Flying Proletarian was:</p>

<blockquote>...set in the year 2125 and features a giant air battle, with death rays and such, between the Soviet proletarian and the American bourgeois air forces. The latter prevails until an uprising of New York workers against their government turns the tide. Mayakovsky's communist future is all comfort and electric ease: electric razors, electric toothbrushes, everybody with his own private airplane (Moscow no longer has any streets, just airports). Labor is wholly mechanized, so that a worker merely operates a keyboard. Altogether, Mayakovsky's utopia is written from the viewpoint of a laborer who is tired of backbreaking, dirty work. . . . There are no kitchens, no housework. People eat in aerocafeterias and amuse themselves with cosmic cinemas, cosmic dances, and such--all nonalcoholic (alcohol is served by prescription only). The sport of the future is avio-polo--football has long since been abandoned as crude and boring.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-24-mechanical-blue/">mechanical blueberry harvesters</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If you're serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation.  Here's an example of a <a href="http://www.dbe.ca/blueberryharvester.htm">blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia</a></p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels. This rotation is at a speed in ratio to the forward motion of the tractor. As the comb type-picking bars rake the blueberries from the plants they are carried around the reel and deposited in a conveyor. This conveyor delivers them to another longer conveyor, which carries them to the rear three-point-hitch mounted loading platform. As the berries fall from the conveyor a blower cleans them.
</blockquote>

<p>The harvester was invented by <a href="http://www.nsac.ns.ca/halloffame/citations/bragg_douglas.htm">R. Douglas Bragg</a> (1930-1996):</p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg always maintained a strong interest in the blueberry industry. Not only was he a manufacturer of the patented wild blueberry harvester and a blueberry producer himself, but he was an active member of the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia. From 1979 to 1981 he served as a Director and was an active member of the Research Committee from the time of its inception until the fall of 1996. He was a Founding Director of the Nova Scotia Blueberry Institute and was instrumental in the early days of its development and building of the research field station at Debert. In 1995 Doug received the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia Award of Recognition.
</blockquote>

<p>There's a set of patents on blueberry harvesters.  Here's what US Patent <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5375403/description.html">5365403, Lowbush berry harvester</a> has to say about the Bragg patented harvester:</p>

<blockquote>
A later development is reported in Canadian Pat. No. 1,249,727 of Bragg Lumber Company. According to the patent, this harvester mounts a picking head, almost identical to the Chisholm-Ryder head, on the side of a farm tractor, but in such a manner that the picking head is "towed " by the tractor. The arrangement ostensibly accommodates variations in the ground by allowing for pitch and roll of the head during operation. As with the Chisholm-Ryder head, the tines of the Bragg harvester are controlled by a cam and cam follower arrangement. In the Bragg harvester, as the tines approach top dead centre of the reel they are caused to flap rapidly to dislodge the berries carried thereby for easy deposit on the internal conveyor.
</blockquote>

<p>On my favorite blueberry-picking grounds, there's way too many ferns, jack pines, jack pine cones, bits of lichen and moss to ever make it suited for mechanical harvesting; just as well.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Whenever I come across some topic related to both blueberries and the title of this blog (vacuum), I am compelled to post it.  In this case, we have "vacuum microwave drying" or VMD, a food preservation technique using a vacuum chamber and a microwave energy source instead of a typical hot air or freeze drying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engineer.msu.ac.th/CD_Conference/conference/CD-Conferance/IDS2000/home/pdf/318.pdf">QUALITY OF THE VACUUM MICROWAVE DRIED BLUEBERRIES IN TERMS <br />

Ziba Vaghri, Christine H. Scaman, David D. Kitts, Timothy D. Durance, and David A.J. <br />
McArthur</a></p>

<blockquote>
Vacuum microwave drying has great potential to produce high quality food products with greater retention of heat and oxygen sensitive bioactive components. Blueberries have recently been noted for their high antioxidant activity.  The components that are likely to be responsible for this activity are the phenolic compounds and vitamin C content.  This study compared the effects of vacuum microwave, air, freeze, and a combination of air/vacuum microwave drying on vitamin C, anthocyanin, phenolic, and antioxidant activity of two blueberry cultivars.  In addition the color characteristics of the berries were assessed. Vacuum microwave dried berries retained higher amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanin, and phenolics than air-dried berries. All blueberry extracts exhibited antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to anthocyanin, total phenolic and vitamin C content. There was no significant difference between the antioxidant activities of vacuum microwave dried and freeze-dried blueberries.

Where the white man gazed with awe<br />
At a paradise divided<br />
By the straits of Mackinac</p>

<p>Men are dredging, drilling, blasting,<br />
Battling tides around the clock,<br />
Through the depths of icy water,<br />
Driving caissons down to rock.</p>

<p>Fleets of freighters bring their cargoes<br />
From the forges and the kilns;<br />
Stones and steel - ten thousand barge-loads -<br />
From the quarries, mines, and mills.</p>

<p>Now the towers, mounting skyward,<br />
Reach the heights of airy space.<br />
Hear the rivet-hammers ringing,<br />
Joining steel in strength and grace.</p>

<p>High above the swirling currents,<br />
Parabolic strands are strung;<br />
From the cables, packed with power,<br />
Wonder-spans of steel are hung.</p>

<p>Generations dreamed the crossing;<br />
Doubters shook their heads in scorn.<br />
Brave men vowed that they would build it -<br />
From their faith a bridge was born.</p>

<p>There it spans the miles of water,<br />
Speeding millions on their way - <br />
Bridge of vision, hope and courage,<br />
Portal to a brighter day.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>     <br />
Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br />
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.<br />
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br />
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br />
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br />
Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br />
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br />
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br />
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br />
Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br />
Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br />
We trekked and picked until the cans were full,<br />
Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br />
With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br />
Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br />
With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.</p>

<p>We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br />
But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br />
A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br />
The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br />
The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br />
I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br />
That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br />
Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not. </p>

      <p><a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">What is Discardia?</a></p>

<blockquote>
Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas you no longer need. It's about letting go, abdicating from obligation and guilt, being true to the self you are now. Discardia is the time to get rid of things that no longer add value to your life, shed bad habits, let go of emotional baggage and generally lighten your load. - Dinah Sanders
</blockquote>

<p>Discardia was the theme of today's <a href="http://twitter.com/a2b3">a2b3</a> Thursday lunch.</p>

<p>We talked of family emptying years of accumulation as their inheritances, including removing acres of scrap metal from a farm, organizing two day long estate sales, auctioning old books off by the case, and dealing with the environmental impact of 200 old tires.  Some of that meant quite a bit of money and some family bonding time; others of it was stories of incredible hassles.</p>

<p>Balancing that, of course, was the urge to collect, whether it be <a href="http://potifos.com/fraud/">Nigerian fraud email</a>, <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/349434750/in/pool-fairydoors">fairy door drawing from your kids</a>, <a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/superpatron">books you've read or would like to read</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/vielmetti/annarbor">web pages about Ann Arbor</a>, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/05/my_quadrille_no.html">handwritten notebooks</a>, <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/">online notebooks</a>, or any of the things in the physical world.  Physical world stuff - tools, two-by-four remnants, scrap metal, pig-themed trinkets, fish-themed trinkets, books, books, more books, paper (sorted or unsorted) take up a lot more space, but the online things occupy your brain too.</p>

<p>What are you doing for discardia?  We've been emptying kitchen cupboards of unused pans - one piece that's on its way out is a broiling pan (Not Much Use In A Vegetarian Household).</p>

<p>3:15.  Lawn extension and city street right-of-way.</p>

<p>The owner of every parcel of land is responsible for grading, planting, mowing and raking the extension or city street right-of-way so that it is covered with turf grass with an average height not in excess of 12 inches or other ground cover vegetation with an average height not in excess of 36 inches above the adjacent road surface unless it presents a view hazard based on the criteria in the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials) Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 5th Edition (2005), or as subsequently amended. The city shall not be liable for damage to any vegetation planted, or to any property or fixtures placed, in or upon the lawn extension or the city right-of-way that results from work performed by the city in the lawn extension or right-of-way.</p>

<p>(Ord. No. 43-04, § 17, 1-3-05; Ord. No. 19-05, § 4, 5-16-05)</p>

<p>A friend got a ticket for having an unmaintained extension, which she thinks is because her day lilies were too high (never mind that day lilies are a native plant and are beautiful this time of year).</p>

<p>More on day lilies from the <a href="http://www.daylilyclub.net/">Southern Michigan Daylily Society</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote>
Some Daylilies are dormant with their foliage dying back completely,
others are evergreens, there is also a wide range in between referred
to as semi-evergreen.   They have tuberous, somewhat fleshy roots
and strap or grass-like leaves that arch gracefully making clumps
attractive even when not in bloom.</p>

<p>Clusters of blooms appear at the top of a mostly leafless stem, known <br />
as a scape, which grows above the foliage. Sometimes there is <br />
branching on the scape allowing for multiple blooms each day. The <br />
Daylily bloom itself is only open for one day hence the name <br />
Hemerocallis, “beautiful for a day”.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>Since 1994, Cosma Shalizi has been keeping track of what he is reading and what he is interested in in his <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/">notebooks</a> online.</p>

<pre>
Burned all my notebooks 
What good are notebooks 
If they won't help me survive?
</pre>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notebooks/faq.html#colophon">colophon</a> is worth quoting in full, though you'll need to go to the original to get all of the hyperlinks.</p>

<p><blockquote>
These notebooks began in September 1994 as a set of key-words for Usenet filtering; I don&rsquo;t remember why I started to elaborate them, but I did, and put them online on 3 October 1994. They quickly became a single huge useless file, which a few people, moved by boredom, misplaced pity or Teutonic thoroughness, were kind enough to read. At their urging, on 13 March 1995 I split it into many more or less conveniently sized files, one per subject, ordered by date. (Those still dated 1994 haven&rsquo;t been significantly changed since before then, or if they have, I&rsquo;ve been too lazy to update their date.) That was the last change in format until March 2004, when I moved them into Blosxom, so they could have an RSS feed and a basic search facility (since I&rsquo;m clearly never going to get around to creating, much less maintaining, a genuine index).</p>

<p>The notebooks have been written in Emacs on, successively, 1992-vintage NeXT workstations, a succession of Sun workstations, a second-hand Powerbook Duo named sloth, a much-missed Powerbook G4 named gluttony and, currently, a new Powerbook named wrath. (Note to hardware manufacturers: those could be the names of your products instead, if you give them to me!) Each notebook is a simple HTML file. (The ones containing mathematical symbols are produced using HTMX.) For the first ten years, that was it. Since I started using Blosxom, it's dynamically generated the displayed pages, so that the pages you read are filtered, prettified versions of the ones I write. Index pages are statically generated (using cron every half hour), so they get served faster, and some fiddling with Apache's URL re-writing engine keeps you from seeing the seams. The complete installation uses the following Blosxom plugins: entries_template, file, find, flavourdir, foreshortened, interpolate_conditional, meta, metadate, SmartyPants, storytitle. Danny Yee kindly provided me with a cascading style sheet, and explained how to use it.<br />

      <p>A place to collect fruit crop damage reports for 2008.  Today is the 53rd Annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association, will be June 18, at 2 p.m. at the Amway Grand Hotel, in Grand Rapids; when those reports come in for real I'll post them.</p>

Poor Weather Has Cut Size of Most U.S. Fruit Crops</p>

<p>June 19, 2008 - By Dick Lehnert <br />
Managing Editor</p>

<p>Crummy spring weather coast to coast has reduced the production for most fruit crops. The word “record” was used only once – for blueberries – during the 53rd annual Fruit Crop Guesstimate. </p>

<p>The Guesstimate, sponsored by the Michigan Frozen Food Packers Association and attended by more than 150 people from across North America, was held June 18 in Grand Rapids, Mich. </p>

<p>Many of the presenters adjusted their PowerPoint presentations as they were making them, reflecting continuing poor weather. New York has hit by a hail storm of “epic proportions” on June 16, and the June drop, delayed and prolonged by cool weather that slowed crop development, was still taking apples and peaches from trees across the northern states. <br />

<p>June 18: <a href="http://www.record-eagle.com/local/local_story_170094110.html">Traverse City cherry crop damage</a></p>

<p><blockquote>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just completely trashed,&rdquo; Williams said of the small tract of cherry trees along Bright Road south of Maple City. &ldquo;You can see how it took the leaves down and everything &hellip; it stripped (the cherries) right off the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hail that pelted Williams' fruit trees marked the latest episode in a series of nature-related setbacks blamed for damaging the region's cherry crop. This year's harvest is shaping up as the worst since the nearly cherry-less summer of 2002, experts said.<br />

<p><blockquote>
Orchards were damaged last week when temperatures dropped as low as the mid-20s, but farms in the northern half of the county – above the 45th Parallel – weren’t hit quite so hard, said Nikki Rothwell, director of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Resource Station.</p>

<p>“I think there is significant damage out there. We can’t put a number on it but we’ve got poor pollination on top of a freeze event,” she said.</p>

<p>Apples were hit hardest by early morning cold May 28, followed by sweet cherries and then tarts and other crops growing in moderate to poor sites, or in a valley or pocket more susceptible to cold weather, she said.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>via <a href="http://ubois.com">archivist Jeff Ubois</a>, this account of using needle sorting cards for human intelligence gathering:</p>

<blockquote>
Alfred De Grazia, with Floyd Hunter and Paul Deutschmann, wrote a training manual in 1954 for the State Dept., "DISCOVERING NATIONAL ELITES   A Manual of Methods for Discovering the Leadership of a Society and Its Vulnerabilities to Propaganda" that includes an approach to social network analysis for "propaganda-target analysis" based on punch cards. It's now been declassified:

</ul>

<p>The rest of De Grazia's site is out there (though one might have said the same thing in 1954 if presented with a scheme for punch card analysis of social networks.)<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>If you look closely at this personnel record, it's eerily reminscent of the data structure of a LinkedIn record.  Note that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/18/digitalmedia.mediabusiness2">LinkedIn just sold off a 5% slice for $53 million</a>, giving them a nominal valuation of $1 billion; with 23 million membership records, that's about $40 per punchcard.</p>

<p>Kevin Kelly (re)discovered these cards recently and has a nice set with photos in his piece <a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/one_dead_media.php">One Dead Media</a>, noticing that nothing of this description was anything he could find anywhere:</p>

<blockquote>
But prescient as it was, and as cool as these cards were, I searched the Net today for any sign of InDecks and was surprised to find no sellers on eBay, no fan sites, no collector sites, no historical web pages, and no evidence that anyone is still using them.  They are gone. Blasted out by the first computers. Bruce Sterling lists them in his Dead Media file, a catalog of defunct media devices and platforms.  They seem to be verifiably extinct.
</blockquote>

<p>Believing that nothing really goes extinct, I challenge you to reinvent these in some useful, usable way.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two versions of this map, one showing survey details, the other aggregating by county.</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://popvssoda.com:2998/"><img alt="Picture_2" title="Picture_2" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/18/picture_2.png" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a><br />

<p><br/></p>

<p>The great pop vs. soda controversy is a project that Alan McConchie did to survey regional use of generic names for soft drinks.  You'll see here clearly that Michigan is a "pop" state; the sharp Wisconsin vs. Upper Peninsula divide of soda vs. pop is notable.  You have to do pretty far south into Indiana to see "coke" as the generic.</p>

<p>Matthew Campbell from East Central University (Oklahoma) took this data set and organized it on county boundaries.  Again Wisconsin vs. UP is clear on the soda/pop scale.  I'll attribute that to a difference in state law: it's "pop" if you have to pay a 10 cent deposit on the can, and "soda" if you don't.</p>
