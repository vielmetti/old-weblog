        <p>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota. From a profile of Jim Johnson by writer Cheryl Reitan in the mnartists.org site: JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-03-jim-johnson-poe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In the manage by numbers world... One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress. At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work. If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">&raquo;</a></p>

As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily.

        <p>I've typed some things about bug camp, but haven't blogged about it. The name of the place is not really bug camp; it's the Page Center in Little Lake, MI: Our peaceful, natural setting on Little Lake is the perfect place for your next retreat, reunion, wedding, reception or workshop. Located 3 miles East of M-35/553, approximately 24 miles south of Marquette. It's a nice spot, a former church camp, with a lovely main house, a dining hall and kitchen, and eight bunk cabins. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-29-2008-summer-bug/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a bit of science fiction I'd like to read - The time is the future, but the near future, within reach - perhaps 2012. The hero has some kind of cognitive deficit that's progressive, so that they are slowly losing their ability to reason. (Think Flowers for Algernon, for instance.) The twist is that the nature of the loss of thinking is that they are fine in person and in everything they normally do, but that they are unable to effectively use search engines any more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-25-noe-web-disease/">&raquo;</a></p>

Another wild blueberries on the bush photo from istockphoto is 10 credits (quatloos? rubles? I don't know the exchange rate).

        <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS By John Clark My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-blueberry-summe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At one point I had a whole blog devoted to collecting information about the telegraph; it's still there, but dormant. Ah, passing interests. Along the way, I got this suggestion, which I share: "If you're looking for "telegraph literature" (i.e. stories involving telegraphs) then you should certainly read "The Telegraph Girl" by Anthony Trollope and an accompanying article "The Young Women at the London Telegraph Office" and then Kipling's story "Wireless." <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-the-telegraph-i/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From time to time people ask questions about Ann Arbor, and from time to time there are what appear to be encyclopedic responses to them. Part of the reason for this is Arborwiki, a wiki that covers information about Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Washtenaw County and the rest of the area. Matt Hampel runs this with an ad hoc collective doing editorial direction and the Ann Arbor District Library providing hosting. It's not advertising driven, and while is has a lot of information about businesses any obviously marketing copy gets edited out pretty quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-thank-you-for-s/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It's fruit season (or nearly so) and so it's time to start thinking about what we're going to do for making holiday gifts. One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy. We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/">&raquo;</a></p>
