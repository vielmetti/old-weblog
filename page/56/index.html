<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>day 8 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>Almost every week for the last 4 years I&#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers.&#0160; Repetition makes it a bit easier.</p><p>Most weeks I try, or at least intend to try, to put together some notes about lunch.&#0160; Now that I&#39;m no longer just an experienced blogger but also a fledgling analog journalist, I took some notes; these are incomplete, but they are more complete than I normally do.&#0160; I&#39;m hoping to get better at note-taking as time goes on.&#0160; </p><p>People go around the table and introduce themselves; I asked people to say a few words about what&#39;s going on for them.&#0160; This list below links in most cases to people&#39;s or organizations Arborwiki pages, since that lets me edit and fill in some of the blanks later or to have some of the blanks already filled in.</p><p>In order of how I wrote them down, with a simple question: what did you notice this week?&#0160; Apologies if I got anything wrong or incomplete, and I know there are incomplete bits here.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Patricia_Anderson">Patricia Anderson</a> - U of Michigan emerging technologies librarian - talked about some meetings she was at with folks at the U looking at getting UM communications people engaged in social media; the good story was about introducing people for the first time to SlideShare.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Linda_Diane_Feldt">Linda Diane Feldt</a> - holistic health practitioner - spoke about foraging, and teaching people about where to find black raspberries and wondering why more people weren&#39;t out picking them.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/David_C._Bloom">David C.

                <div class="delicious-extended">Not hilarious. It makes sense. Over 90% of Politico’s revenue comes from its print edition, even though it’s only distributed in D.C. The truth is, as the CFOs of both the NYTimes and WSJ will tell you, print advertising, on a CPM basis, generates 75x more revenue than Web ads.

                <div class="delicious-extended">In the past several weeks, I’ve been playing with a new format that my friends at TopTenSources developed. We’ve seen the Citizen Journalist; this idea is the Citizen Editor. Several of us have been using a new bookmarklet-style tool that makes it very easy to tag a story when you’re reading it, provide a bit of analysis, and have it posted to a dedicated website on the topic. It’s in many ways what lots of bloggers do anyway. I remember Dave Winer showing me an aspect of Manila that renders a river of news and then lets you check off stories that you want to appear somewhere — dead simple and fun; this idea is in the same vein, only using different tools and with a different output.</div>

<p>Today, the Internet has brought countless communities of interest together. Some of them blog and some of them chat among themselves. They can connect with each other — and with us — using only a few keystrokes and the “send” button.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">United has demonstrated they know how to keep their airline in the forefront of their customer’s minds and I wanted this project to expand upon that satirically. I’ve been done “being angry” for quite some time and, if anything, I should thank United. They’ve given me a creative outlet that has brought people together from around the world. We had a pile of laughs making the recording and the video while the images are spinning on how to make “United: Song 2” even better than the first. So, thanks United! If my guitar had to be smashed due to extreme negligence I’m glad it was you that did it. Now sit back and enjoy the show.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">The kind of people who are affected by The Ann Arbor News becoming annarbor.com are generally less hardcore about their sports coverage.</p>

<p>But with the transition to the web, they are promising to link out a lot, so having more of a two-way relationship with the local news sites would help, probably just in terms of Google ranking and maybe some traffic. Right now I link to them and The Free Press fairly often, and I don’t think I’ve ever received a link from any of those sources. That seems a little unbalanced.</div><br />

      <p>day 7 of a continuing series documenting my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>There&#39;s a wonderful weekly program on KCRW in Santa Monica called <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/gf">Good Food</a>.&#0160; Host Evan Kleiman does a roundup of reporting from the restaurants and farmers markets around Los Angeles, with interviews with restaurant owners, talks with farmers at markets about the produce they are bringing to market this week, and feature stories about restaurant excursions into the many cuisines that make up LA.&#0160; It&#39;s a very fun show, and especially when it&#39;s the middle of an Ann Arbor winter there&#39;s something sunny and cheery about hearing that something is in season somewhere. </p><p>I went to the Wednesday market at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Farmers_Market">Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a> today.&#0160; It&#39;s about six blocks from the office, and for a number of years I&#39;ve been a regular there, either at the Wednesday or the Saturday market.&#0160; I came with pencil and pad of paper in hand and no shopping basket and walked around looking at what was there, and what caught my eye was berries - lots of berries - really, the high season of the berry season.&#0160; So to provide a proper catalog, here&#39;s what&#39;s in season at market this week:</p><ul>
<li>Strawberries.&#0160; Nearing the end of the season.</li>
<li>Blueberries.&#0160; Just starting the season.</li>
<li>Gooseberries, red and green.&#0160; One vendor, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem%27s">Wasem&#39;s</a>.</li>
<li>Currants, red and black, also both at Wasem&#39;s.</li>
<li>Blackberries.</li>
<li>Mulberries.&#0160; I was surprised to see them, because I think of them as street tree food, but they were there.</li>
<li>Red Raspberries, both conventional and organic.</li>
<li>Cherries, sweet, sour, and Queen Anne.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken a taste to the sour cherries - more flavor and less sweet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might have missed black raspberries; they are ripe in bushes around town, including at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wheeler_Park">Wheeler Park</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wurster_Park">Wurster Park</a>.&#0160; The juneberry / serviceberry season is either over or just about over depending on the tree you go to.&#0160;&#0160; <a href="http://arborwiki/city/Molly_Notarianni">Molly Notarianni</a>, the market manager, says she saw wild gooseberries along a path around <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Pickerel_Lake">Pickerel Lake</a>, near the stone fireplaces.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>day six of notes about my new position at annarbor.com</p><p>It&#39;s about a mile and a half as the crow flies from my office at annarbor.com to my home.&#0160;&#0160; If I&#39;m willing to detour a bit out of the way along the way, I can make a reasonable direct path by bus, bicycle, or walking that takes me through a big part of central campus, the athletic campus, a few neighborhoods, about 20 coffee and ice cream shops, and dozens of bulletin boards where events and notices are posted.</p><p>Tuesday&#39;s trek home I did on foot with my cell phone open to Twitter and with my eyes open for what was going on on central campus.&#0160;&#0160; I got a chance to see new businesses and closing businesses on Liberty St and State St, the relative quiet of the Diag in the summer time, picture-perfect Law Quad greenery, and giant touch-screen displays inside the business school.&#0160;&#0160; Interestingly enough, the twitter stream I sent out got enough comments that I felt like I had people double checking the observations I had along the way (and I have half a dozen followups to understand more).</p><p>I&#39;ve commuted home from downtown before, but almost all of the time it was of the variety of commute where every single day I caught the exact same bus at the exact last minute and saw the same thing every day.&#0160; I&#39;m sure there will still be some of that, but a reasonable goal is to walk down a new street every day and just notice what is going on there.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Trying to keep the chronology going - this is back to Monday of this week.</p><p>I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> .&#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wrestling with this, in part because I&#39;ve been blogging so long (since 1999) that there has been a big shift in what the popular press has characterized and categorized bloggers as.&#0160; When I started, the blogger was either the extremely widely read Internet explorer who kept a log of the many interesting things that came across their path, or it was the expert in some field (at times a very narrow field) who used a less formal sequential writing tool to capture details and query others in their niche interest about what was going on and relevant.</p><p>It&#39;s only much later that in some people&#39;s minds that blogger turned into the text equivalent of political talk radio show host as seen in text.&#0160; There it&#39;s been obvious that whatever standards of practice there are are much less interested in pursuit of Truth or of careful observation and much more about propoganda in one form or another.&#0160; Not that the press and the media and public relations hasn&#39;t done propoganda for many years - it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not the norm for old school blogging.</p><p>I&#39;m hopeful as I suppose I have to be that AnnArbor.com&#39;s experiment with giving voice to readers as contributors makes for something that adds to the whole operation.&#0160; I&#39;ve talked to any number of people for whom when I describe what I&#39;m looking for as &quot;experts who can write but who are not professional writers&quot;, rather than &quot;bloggers with free reign to spew unsourced and unedited opinion&quot;, that some of the concerns ease.&#0160; But I suspect it will take a whole year of refining what the Ann Arbor School of Blogging has as a style and attitude that sets it apart from the rest of the world that will make the difference.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">I learned to mistrust the US popular press several years ago. A friend of mine is positioned high enough in the military to have a sense of the big picture and low enough to have a sense of what is going on in the lives of the “grunts”. It is an interesting point of view, and I have found little tidbits that cropped up in conversation to sometimes be wildly different from what was reported by our media. I learned to use the online resources and search engines available to access news media reports from around the world, and have also found that the richest information often comes not from the big name feeds but from the small town local press where the events unfolded. It is a natural extension of this to take a serious look at citizen journalism, the shift toward reporting major events and news from the viewpoint of the common person.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Its goal is explore the possibility of using technology as a means for blind individuals to orient themselves in both outdoor and interior spaces, and to learn more about their surroundings during their normal walking from place to place, or when they choose to explore an area to learn what&#039;s nearby. Currently, we do this by tagging objects of interest with an RFID reader, and providing an RFID reader and computer to read the tags. Unlike ordinary RFID readers, the TalkingPoints reader speaks the information conveyed by the tag to the user.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Several people identified “Arthur” as one of the more aggressive panhandlers, known for walking with a single crutch. Rebecca Konieczny, owner of the Busy Hands yarn and gift store, said she’d gotten so mad that she followed him up and down Main Street, calling the police from her cell phone. Someone else suggested that perhaps merchants start carrying mace and pepper spray, to which Martelle responded: “I can’t condone the use of mace on the homeless population.”</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Only one thing may put lard back on the slippery slope: Google the word as news, and it might as well be lard-fearing 1969 all over again. Newspaper food pages still routinely advise using olive or canola oils rather than &quot;fattening&quot; or &quot;artery-clogging&quot; lard. Or they print idiotic utterances like &quot;you get all the lard you need at McDonald&#039;s&quot; (a chain that actually abandoned beef tallow for frying its fries only to be saddled with a trans-fatty substitute). Occasionally an article will make a valid point—lard is still anathema to vegetarians and halal observers—but more often there will be surprise that lard does not taste anything like pig.</div>

CSV, of course, stands for &quot;Comma Separated Values&quot;, more often than not though, it seems that CSV files use tabs to separate values rather than commas. And let&#039;s not even mention field quoting. If you deal with CSV files and you use Python the csv module can make your life a bit easier.</div>

      </h3>
      <p>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process.</p><p>Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.</p><p>In some sense that&#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &quot;law of two feet&quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people.&#0160; I had a great time but the dynamic was odd enough that I want to try to get to a 100pm stop time again instead of 130pm.&#0160; So here&#39;s some suggestions that came in from that.</p><p>1.&#0160; Bring introductions down to the completely minimal.&#0160; I&#39;ve been in circles where the entire intro was full name plus three more words, nothing more, and the intros go around the table at something like two or three per minute.&#0160; If you have to condense your identity into three words you have to think hard, or be funny.</p><p>2.&#0160; Reach a larger audience in more smaller venues.&#0160; Promote a set of places to meet at the same time, and let people pick which of many places they want to show up; synchronize and coordinate so that someone organizes at each location at the same time.&#0160; </p><p>3.&#0160; Use some kind of token - like boarding passes a la Southwest - to hand out to people so that you know how many people are there and which order you handed them out in.&#0160; Use that both to plan how many seconds you have for each intro and to provide an order to things.</p><p>4.&#0160; Get inspired by events like <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> and hold a rock paper scissors tournament to winnow out the crowd down to a reasonable size; only the last four or eight people standing get to say who they are, and they get more time to talk.</p><p>5.&#0160; Don&#39;t let people introduce themselves; rather, the host introduces everyone.</p><p>6.&#0160; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24441.html">Inspired by the Washington Post,</a> host an exclusive event and charge a lot of money for access to &quot;those powerful few&quot;.&#0160; </p><p>7.&#0160; Don&#39;t worry about it; it will work itself out somehow with something someone suggests on the spot.</p>

<p>The astonishing offer was detailed in a flier circulated Wednesday to a health care lobbyist, who provided it to a reporter because the lobbyist said he felt it was a conflict for the paper to charge for access to, as the flier says, its “health care reporting and editorial staff.&quot;</div><br />

Alweer geïnspireerd door de Engelse universiteiten, natuurlijk. Goed afkijken, is ook een kunst. In Amerika zijn ze trouwens ook dol op de Griekse en Romeinse bouwstijlen. Als ze ergens een zuil kunnen tussen wringen, zullen ze het zeker niet laten. Zelfs moderne gebouwen worden met klassieke zuilen versierd. Bij mij roepen al die zuilen eerder een gevoel van slechte imitatie op.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a complete list of where all of the Amelanchier (juneberry, shadbush, sugar plum depending on where you are from) trees are on the public streets in Ann Arbor.&#0160; The complete inventory shows 356 trees, each geocoded; rather than try to pin them on a map, this is by street name in alphabetical order, with quite a bit of duplicates eliminated.</p>
<p>The whole program to do this is</p>
<p>grep -i Amelanchier trees09.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3, &quot;between&quot;, $4, &quot;and &quot; $5}&#39; | sort | uniq &gt; juneberry.txt</p>
<p>where the trees09.csv file is downloadable from the Ann Arbor Chronicle who originally sourced this data from the city of Ann Arbor; <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/07/01/city-and-residents-to-make-tree-policy/">see their story about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Alas this post is a little bit too late for this season; by July 2, 2009, many of the juneberry trees are completely ripe, so get picking.</p>

When I think of mainstream news, TV, and newspaper sites trying to solicit comments from readers, I&#039;ve yet to find something close to even a basic community site.

      </h3>
      <p>day 3 notes</p><p>I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.</p><p>In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89.1 WEMU FM; and Dave Gershman from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; Some part of the DDA meeting was also recorded by video cameras; I haven&#39;t figured out yet how to replay that.</p><p>It&#39;s instructive to see the different viewpoints that these three media channels provide, and to figure out what added perspective you could get from it.</p><p>Dave Askins was twittering out notes on <a href="http://twitter.com/A2ChronicleMeet">@A2ChronicleMeet</a> with a running play by play.&#0160; I&#39;m certain that it will be part of the raw materials for a long, descriptive, detailed account of the meeting, complete with bits of reflection on logos on garbage cans and the ins and outs of what roles and responsibilities flow to the mayor pro tem.&#0160; Dave gave a great talk at <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> 1 the previous night about how the extremely descriptive style of news that the Chronicle publishes serves them well in reviewing things long after the fact, even if wading through 7000 words seems like a bit long for right now in a world where reporters are used to publishing 500 or 1000.</p><p>Andrew Cluely from WEMU was in the back taking a few notes, and he had his recorder out front at the end of the meeting with one of the board members.&#0160; I looked online really hard for where the story might have been posted already, and came up at best with <a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wemu/news.newsmain?action=search&amp;advanced=true&amp;newSearch=true&amp;searchOption=1&amp;TEASE_WORDS=cluley&amp;BYLINE_WORDS=&amp;Submit=Search">this page where it might be</a>, buried deep on a search string.&#0160; There&#39;s some wasted opportunity here, since the same-day audio clip is going to give you a perspective on decisions later - if, and only if, you can find it again.</p><p>Dave Gershman filed two stories from the Ann Arbor News - one on how the DDA&#39;s <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/downtown_ann_arbor_mural_plan.html">decision on public arts funding impacts the murals proposed by Fire Up Downtown</a>, and one on how <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/ann_arbor_expects_federal_prog.html">federal stimulus money will save $1.5 million in financing costs for the Library Lot underground garage</a>.&#0160; The mural story attracted MLive&#39;s usual crowd of incredibly lame, rude, and anonymous commenters - people who didn&#39;t add any value to the story.</p><p>Now I know that there were a lot more stories to be told out of that event - the continuing saga of somewhat confused people figuring out how e-Park meters work, the continuing series of anecdotes about how the Maynard St structure is always full without any supporting data or analysis, and the parliamentary maneuvers about whether Leigh Greden should be able to vote in the seat reserved for the mayor as mayor pro tem.&#0160; </p><p>Where do you start with news?&#0160; Small town politics of parking meters.&#0160; I&#39;m told that new employees at the New York Times and returning international correspondents once worked the sanitation beat as their first stint (and I can&#39;t source that quote, even though I&#39;d like to, because I didn&#39;t bookmark that link).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Another part of day 3 -</p><p>We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript.&#0160; Microsoft Word is one version of that process; there&#39;s lots more paths that get there.</p><p>I know that when I used to use Typepad, that the rich text editor I had was pretty good about stripping out tags and attributes that were weird.&#0160; Font tags disappeared, for instance, which made it possible to be sure that stuff didn&#39;t show up as Comic Sans unless I really wanted them to be in Comic Sans.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found out so far.</p><p><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/developer/rich-text-editors.html">MT supports multiple kinds of rich text editor abstractions.</a>&#0160; There&#39;s currently support for the YUI editor, for TinyMCE, and for FCK.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The relevant bit of configuration code is wrapped in<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <code>&lt;mt:setvarblock name=&quot;editor_content&quot;&gt;</code></p><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tinymce-mtplugin/">TinyMCE MT plugin source</a> posted on Google Code.&#0160; The current release, supporting Japanese and English, is in active development and is at version 0.1.11 as of 29 hours ago.</p><p>Richard Benson wrote and supports the <a href="http://www.richardbenson.co.uk/projects/yui-rich-text-editor-in-movabl.html?utm_source=mt-plugins&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=yui-editor">YUI MT plugin</a>, which is at version 1.3.</p><p>Now, to the actual MT rich text editor:</p><p>A rant from<a accesskey="1" href="http://padawan.info/en/2007/07/upgrading-to-mt.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>François Nonnenmacher</a> about the HTML generated by the MT rich text editor:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>The Rich Text Editor produces tons of ugly fucking code behind the screen</strong>, especially when using Safari. So it&#39;s an <a href="http://padawan.info/web/oldschool_rich_text_editors.html">old-school editor</a> such <a href="http://padawan.info/web/midas.html">Midas</a>, only a slight improvement over <abbr title="What You See Is Fucking Ugly Code">WYSIFUC</abbr> in the sense that it hides it from you (unless you select &quot;none&quot; in the Format menu or &quot;HTML Mode&quot; and scream in horror at the <abbr title="Fucking Ugly Code">FUC</abbr>
it generates, like &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style:
italic;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;!). For
example, on Safari it generates a DIV per paragraph, while on Firefox
it just spits out &lt;br&gt; tags or cosmetic &lt;i&gt; or &lt;b&gt;
tags (not even &lt;br /&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; tags, mind
you).<br /></div><p><br />And generally that&#39;s my experience to date; weird tags, bad semantics, and unpredictable behavior.&#0160; What I don&#39;t know yet (and hope to figure out) is what the data path is through the system that would let things be cleaned up and filtered on the back end so that they are consistent, or fixed on the front end so that the generated code from the rich text editor is better.</p><p>The funny thing is, this used to work better: old versions of Typepad, and old versions of MT, both had a very conservative rich text editor that denatured the text quite a bit, removing a lot of tags and operating in &quot;safe mode&quot; much more so than &quot;rich mode&quot;.</p><p>a puzzle...</p>

      <p>So, I have a new Blackberry replacing my old Blackberry.&#0160; The new device has a camera in it, which I never had before in a phone.&#0160; So therefore I need to figure out how to get pictures from the phone to the various places I put pictures now and understand the path.</p><p>Facebook: My phone has a Facebook app - it was even pre-installed.&#0160; So the camera has a &quot;Send to Facebook&quot; menu entry, which sends it up.&#0160; <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/features/social/facebook.jsp#tab_tab_start">Here&#39;s a few docs.</a>&#0160; I&#39;ve used this already, it&#39;s fast and easy.</p><p>Twitter.&#0160; The service that I&#39;ve seen people use that seems like it works pretty well is <a href="http://twitpic.com/">Twitpic</a>; it was good enough to capture <a href="http://twitpic.com/135xa">a plane landing on the Hudson</a>.&#0160; To make it work, the consensus seems to be that the best way to go is to send the photo via email to your Twitpic address.&#0160; Haven&#39;t gotten that far yet.</p><p>Typepad.&#0160; <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-blackberry.html">Typepad has a Blackberry app</a>; haven&#39;t tried it yet. &#0160; </p><p>Flickr.&#0160; There&#39;s an existing &quot;email your photos to Flickr&quot; process; Flickr also allows you newly to announce new photos to Twitter.&#0160; <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/upload-photos-to-twitter-by-email/9092/">Here&#39;s a Flickr / Twitter tutorial.</a>&#0160; Again sounds like a good thing to work my way through, again haven&#39;t done it yet.</p><p>overall - my todo list looks like &quot;set up email&quot; next, which gets me Twitter/twitpic; then install the Blackberry app for Typepad; then dig into Flickr&#39;s config to post to Twitter.&#0160; If things work right, I will be able to show things they way they should be.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">While a lot of this crime data is kept confidential to respect people&#039;s privacy, there&#039;s still plenty of publicly available records. Here we take a look at twenty visualization examples that explore this data.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">I tried the &quot;Rhubarb upside-down cake&quot; on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised when the cake turned out perfectly. If other recipes turn out this well, I might buy the book. The content is well balanced and conveniently organized by season and ingredient.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Those interested in the vitality of newspapers — a topic that extends as far as the White House these days — are keeping a close eye on the P-I&#039;s experiment, as Seattle is the first major newspaper to fully pull the plug on print and try to make a go of it online. Many other newspapers are tentatively moving in this direction. Perhaps they&#039;re not kicking print to the curb completely, but they&#039;re cutting back on editions and dropping weak days in print.</div>
