<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

I’ve started to email the SID, Bruce Madej, questions, and he gets back promptly.

<p>&quot;It&#039;s really a bunch of pipsqueaks out there talking about what the real journalists do,&quot; Didiun says.

&quot;death of the comment&quot;. This declaration was extremely significant as Loux&#039;s JS-Kit is currently installed on over 600,000 sites.

                <div class="delicious-extended">If public-records requests are expensive, the Palin administration’s practices help make them so, says Gregg Erickson, a Juneau economist and former state revenue official who publishes a specialized newsletter on Alaska budget issues.</p>

<p>“They have taken the position that a lawyer has to look at every single record before its release. If a lawyer has to look at it and review it, and maybe write a legal opinion on it, well, that’s going to be expensive,” says Mr. Erickson. Court fights also add to the costs, he says.</p>

<p>Citizens and journalists who sought public records have been socked with huge bills. At one point, the Palin administration presented the Associated Press with a bill of $45 million for copies of official state e-mails sent to Palin’s husband, to the McCain campaign, and to federal agencies.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>day 9 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>A new newspaper showed up on my sidewalk yesterday afternoon; I&#39;m not going to name it by name, but let&#39;s just call it the A2 Gerbil.&#0160; It was a happy little paper, full of happy little stories about quaint things happening in some leafy town somewhere near here.&#0160; It took me a couple of minutes to leaf through it and a few more minutes to hunt down the web site for it and appreciate some of its finer points.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I&#39;d pick on the newspaper itself, but you can&#39;t see it unless you live here.&#0160; Like its namesake, it leaves droppings on sidewalks, and if you walk through my neighborhood you&#39;ll notice in a few blocks half a dozen houses that didn&#39;t bother to pick it up, and if you walk down Packard you&#39;ll notice that most houses didn&#39;t manage to pick it up.&#0160; Unsolicited free drop media of all kinds generates litter - in student neighborhoods you perpetually step over rotting copies of the Wall Street Journal delivered but unread.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>There were the usual collection of small town newspaper typoes - spelling mistakes in the body copy, and one I noticed in a headline.&#0160; People make mistakes, but if you&#39;re going to the trouble of printing them, you&#39;d hope there were enough people in the production process and enough spell checking tools to catch them.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>The web site is a charming example of what newspaper web sites looked before RSS feeds made it possible to syndicate news and read it (minus the ads) in a feed reader.&#0160; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a deliberate, calculated design decision, or an omission.&#0160; The one indication that you have that a story is new is a blinking NEW! icon.&#0160; (really)</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>Some of the headlines on the web site could use some work.&#0160; &quot;Construction under way&quot;; that&#39;s not helpful.&#0160; &quot;Ann Arbor&#39;s many distinctions&quot;; that could run every week.&#0160; &quot;Neighbors get their way&quot;; a hint of controversy, I suppose, but again that looks like an every issue column and not really a headline.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>It&#39;s tough being a photo editor, but really, when you print pictures of people in a parade, it would be really nice to get their names, so that you could say who they were so that someone could clip and send the photo to them.&#0160; It just looks weird to see a caption like &quot;Someone is walking in a parade&quot; with no idea who it is.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I hate to poke at someone&#39;s new enterprise, in part because I&#39;m involved in a new enterprise, and it might have some aspects of it in the first issue that aren&#39;t 100% glorious.&#0160; I&#39;m sure that the Gerbil, and its owners at the esteemed Gerbil-Hamster Corporation, is the product of a lot of hard work.&#0160; Alas, it doesn&#39;t say anything about the town I live in - it&#39;s like a picture-perfect mirror to some sleepy parallel universe town where everything is kind of nice in a boring kind of way.&#0160; </p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Though I&#039;m not entirely opposed to this style—witness this very post—most of the blog&#039;s popularity derives from columns titled things like &quot;Teeth and Blood&quot; and &quot;You Were Killed By A Bear And I Am Sad&quot; and 5000-word exegeses on half of a Michigan football game, which are neither search engine- or link-friendly. With some limited exceptions (like throwing the name of each committed recruit into the post title, and providing SEO-friendly headlines for actual news posts) my philosophy has been to make the content as good, and as difficult to replicate, as possible. (Evidently I feel a good, weird title goes a long way.) The cookie cutter is eschewed.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">But some of the most valuable scientific meetings are more focused and deliberative, and are by invitation only. These intellectually intimate gatherings are valuable precisely because the researchers who attend feel free to speculate and to stimulate their colleagues, and to try to establish new research agendas. Whether an attendee is a blogger or a reporter or a practising researcher is immaterial. The meeting is &#039;off the record&#039;, and all have to sign up to that.</p>

<p>Closed or open? Meeting organizers need to be clear in their minds which of these two approaches is appropriate, and be explicit about it from start to finish. The consequence that, in competitive fields, presentations at open meetings will become even more protective and boring is an inevitable consequence of the Internet.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">If you&#039;re going to be &quot;hyperlocal,&quot; that is not what blogs look like. Some of my favorite blogs are anonymous, others are attached to real people&#039;s names, but they generally: share information; aggregate information; analyze information. And the best do all three, but they are not generally breaking news. [Take a look at some of the blogs that will be on the parenting section of Ann Arbor.com; they are well-written and interesting, but they are not news breaking.] In addition, although some of the most credible bloggers I know do use their real names, others don&#039;t. They seem credible to me because their voice comes through (yes, as in &quot;writing voice&quot;), they provide thoughtful analysis, they cite verifiable sources.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">A lot of people wondered how Google would ever make any money with a search engine. That problem was obviously solved. In any community with vast numbers of highly energetic and passionate users, there will be a variety of ways to make money. The only thing that can stop these services are high costs (YouTube and Facebook suffer from this) or someone building a better mousetrap (Facebook did this to MySpace who did this to Friendster).</p>

<p>By the way, News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch isn’t impressed, either, saying that the site is “a tough investment to justify because it has not yet come up with a sustainable way to make money.” He also gave the exact wrong answer to two questions: “Asked if he was considering buying Twitter, Murdoch said, “No.” Asked about selling MySpace, he said, “Hell no.”&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Not hilarious. It makes sense. Over 90% of Politico’s revenue comes from its print edition, even though it’s only distributed in D.C. The truth is, as the CFOs of both the NYTimes and WSJ will tell you, print advertising, on a CPM basis, generates 75x more revenue than Web ads.

We’ve seen the Citizen Journalist; this idea is the Citizen Editor. Several of us have been using a new bookmarklet-style tool that makes it very easy to tag a story when you’re reading it, provide a bit of analysis, and have it posted to a dedicated website on the topic. It’s in many ways what lots of bloggers do anyway. I remember Dave Winer showing me an aspect of Manila that renders a river of news and then lets you check off stories that you want to appear somewhere — dead simple and fun; this idea is in the same vein, only using different tools and with a different output.</div>

Right now I link to them and The Free Press fairly often, and I don’t think I’ve ever received a link from any of those sources. That seems a little unbalanced.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>day 7 of a continuing series documenting my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>There&#39;s a wonderful weekly program on KCRW in Santa Monica called <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/gf">Good Food</a>.&#0160; Host Evan Kleiman does a roundup of reporting from the restaurants and farmers markets around Los Angeles, with interviews with restaurant owners, talks with farmers at markets about the produce they are bringing to market this week, and feature stories about restaurant excursions into the many cuisines that make up LA.&#0160; It&#39;s a very fun show, and especially when it&#39;s the middle of an Ann Arbor winter there&#39;s something sunny and cheery about hearing that something is in season somewhere. </p><p>I went to the Wednesday market at the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Farmers_Market">Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a> today.&#0160; It&#39;s about six blocks from the office, and for a number of years I&#39;ve been a regular there, either at the Wednesday or the Saturday market.&#0160; I came with pencil and pad of paper in hand and no shopping basket and walked around looking at what was there, and what caught my eye was berries - lots of berries - really, the high season of the berry season.&#0160; So to provide a proper catalog, here&#39;s what&#39;s in season at market this week:</p><ul>
<li>Strawberries.&#0160; Nearing the end of the season.</li>
<li>Blueberries.&#0160; Just starting the season.</li>
<li>Gooseberries, red and green.&#0160; One vendor, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem%27s">Wasem&#39;s</a>.</li>
<li>Currants, red and black, also both at Wasem&#39;s.</li>
<li>Blackberries.</li>
<li>Mulberries.&#0160; I was surprised to see them, because I think of them as street tree food, but they were there.</li>
<li>Red Raspberries, both conventional and organic.</li>
<li>Cherries, sweet, sour, and Queen Anne.&#0160; I&#39;ve taken a taste to the sour cherries - more flavor and less sweet.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might have missed black raspberries; they are ripe in bushes around town, including at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wheeler_Park">Wheeler Park</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wurster_Park">Wurster Park</a>.&#0160; The juneberry / serviceberry season is either over or just about over depending on the tree you go to.&#0160;&#0160; <a href="http://arborwiki/city/Molly_Notarianni">Molly Notarianni</a>, the market manager, says she saw wild gooseberries along a path around <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Pickerel_Lake">Pickerel Lake</a>, near the stone fireplaces.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>day six of notes about my new position at annarbor.com</p><p>It&#39;s about a mile and a half as the crow flies from my office at annarbor.com to my home.&#0160;&#0160; If I&#39;m willing to detour a bit out of the way along the way, I can make a reasonable direct path by bus, bicycle, or walking that takes me through a big part of central campus, the athletic campus, a few neighborhoods, about 20 coffee and ice cream shops, and dozens of bulletin boards where events and notices are posted.</p><p>Tuesday&#39;s trek home I did on foot with my cell phone open to Twitter and with my eyes open for what was going on on central campus.&#0160;&#0160; I got a chance to see new businesses and closing businesses on Liberty St and State St, the relative quiet of the Diag in the summer time, picture-perfect Law Quad greenery, and giant touch-screen displays inside the business school.&#0160;&#0160; Interestingly enough, the twitter stream I sent out got enough comments that I felt like I had people double checking the observations I had along the way (and I have half a dozen followups to understand more).</p><p>I&#39;ve commuted home from downtown before, but almost all of the time it was of the variety of commute where every single day I caught the exact same bus at the exact last minute and saw the same thing every day.&#0160; I&#39;m sure there will still be some of that, but a reasonable goal is to walk down a new street every day and just notice what is going on there.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Trying to keep the chronology going - this is back to Monday of this week.</p><p>I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> .&#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wrestling with this, in part because I&#39;ve been blogging so long (since 1999) that there has been a big shift in what the popular press has characterized and categorized bloggers as.&#0160; When I started, the blogger was either the extremely widely read Internet explorer who kept a log of the many interesting things that came across their path, or it was the expert in some field (at times a very narrow field) who used a less formal sequential writing tool to capture details and query others in their niche interest about what was going on and relevant.</p><p>It&#39;s only much later that in some people&#39;s minds that blogger turned into the text equivalent of political talk radio show host as seen in text.&#0160; There it&#39;s been obvious that whatever standards of practice there are are much less interested in pursuit of Truth or of careful observation and much more about propoganda in one form or another.&#0160; Not that the press and the media and public relations hasn&#39;t done propoganda for many years - it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not the norm for old school blogging.</p><p>I&#39;m hopeful as I suppose I have to be that AnnArbor.com&#39;s experiment with giving voice to readers as contributors makes for something that adds to the whole operation.&#0160; I&#39;ve talked to any number of people for whom when I describe what I&#39;m looking for as &quot;experts who can write but who are not professional writers&quot;, rather than &quot;bloggers with free reign to spew unsourced and unedited opinion&quot;, that some of the concerns ease.&#0160; But I suspect it will take a whole year of refining what the Ann Arbor School of Blogging has as a style and attitude that sets it apart from the rest of the world that will make the difference.</p>

      <p><p>A neighbor got a citation for his day lilies, which were in violation of something; I haven&#39;t seen the actual paper he got to know which chapter and verse of city code they violated.</p><p>Looking through it I see Chapter 47 STREETS and section 4:2</p><div class="Normal-Level">

But that’s a story for another day. First things first. I need to give people a reason to care about using a calendar program — any calendar program, could be Outlook or Apple iCal or Google Calendar, so long as it exports iCalendar — in preference to a spreadsheet or word processor. Although the geek tribe can scarcely imagine why, that first step is a doozy.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">I learned to mistrust the US popular press several years ago. A friend of mine is positioned high enough in the military to have a sense of the big picture and low enough to have a sense of what is going on in the lives of the “grunts”. It is an interesting point of view, and I have found little tidbits that cropped up in conversation to sometimes be wildly different from what was reported by our media. I learned to use the online resources and search engines available to access news media reports from around the world, and have also found that the richest information often comes not from the big name feeds but from the small town local press where the events unfolded. It is a natural extension of this to take a serious look at citizen journalism, the shift toward reporting major events and news from the viewpoint of the common person.</div>

There is a doughnut shop and bakery in Clare, Michigan that has been in constant operation since 1896. This foundation business was within weeks of closing when the members of the Clare Police Department came to the rescue. All of them. That&#039;s right, all nine members of the local police department banded together to save this historic business. Dubbed &quot;Cops and Doughnuts,&quot; the business boasts handmade confections of all types. Join us for a warm fresh doughnut and a steaming cup of coffee while you enjoy the police decor and friendly, and very safe, atmosphere.

                <div class="delicious-extended">Only one thing may put lard back on the slippery slope: Google the word as news, and it might as well be lard-fearing 1969 all over again. Newspaper food pages still routinely advise using olive or canola oils rather than &quot;fattening&quot; or &quot;artery-clogging&quot; lard. Or they print idiotic utterances like &quot;you get all the lard you need at McDonald&#039;s&quot; (a chain that actually abandoned beef tallow for frying its fries only to be saddled with a trans-fatty substitute). Occasionally an article will make a valid point—lard is still anathema to vegetarians and halal observers—but more often there will be surprise that lard does not taste anything like pig.</div>

      </h3>
      <p>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process.</p><p>Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.</p><p>In some sense that&#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &quot;law of two feet&quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people.&#0160; I had a great time but the dynamic was odd enough that I want to try to get to a 100pm stop time again instead of 130pm.&#0160; So here&#39;s some suggestions that came in from that.</p><p>1.&#0160; Bring introductions down to the completely minimal.&#0160; I&#39;ve been in circles where the entire intro was full name plus three more words, nothing more, and the intros go around the table at something like two or three per minute.&#0160; If you have to condense your identity into three words you have to think hard, or be funny.</p><p>2.&#0160; Reach a larger audience in more smaller venues.&#0160; Promote a set of places to meet at the same time, and let people pick which of many places they want to show up; synchronize and coordinate so that someone organizes at each location at the same time.&#0160; </p><p>3.&#0160; Use some kind of token - like boarding passes a la Southwest - to hand out to people so that you know how many people are there and which order you handed them out in.&#0160; Use that both to plan how many seconds you have for each intro and to provide an order to things.</p><p>4.&#0160; Get inspired by events like <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> and hold a rock paper scissors tournament to winnow out the crowd down to a reasonable size; only the last four or eight people standing get to say who they are, and they get more time to talk.</p><p>5.&#0160; Don&#39;t let people introduce themselves; rather, the host introduces everyone.</p><p>6.&#0160; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24441.html">Inspired by the Washington Post,</a> host an exclusive event and charge a lot of money for access to &quot;those powerful few&quot;.&#0160; </p><p>7.&#0160; Don&#39;t worry about it; it will work itself out somehow with something someone suggests on the spot.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Found this column by Crain&#039;s blogger Bill Shea on some Michigan Citizen charges against the Detroit Free Press and its coverage of soon-to-be former Detroit Councilperson Monica Conyers.</p>

<p>The story is one thing, but the comments back and forth between Bill and the subject of his story is also good reading.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">For $25,000 to $250,000, The Washington Post has offered lobbyists and association executives off-the-record, non-confrontational access to &quot;those powerful few&quot; — Obama administration officials, members of Congress, and — at first — even the paper’s own reporters and editors.</p>

<p>The astonishing offer was detailed in a flier circulated Wednesday to a health care lobbyist, who provided it to a reporter because the lobbyist said he felt it was a conflict for the paper to charge for access to, as the flier says, its “health care reporting and editorial staff.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Vandaag stond Ann Arbor op het programma, een charmant universiteitsstadje dat in gotische stijl is opgetrokken. Alweer geïnspireerd door de Engelse universiteiten, natuurlijk. Goed afkijken, is ook een kunst. In Amerika zijn ze trouwens ook dol op de Griekse en Romeinse bouwstijlen. Als ze ergens een zuil kunnen tussen wringen, zullen ze het zeker niet laten. Zelfs moderne gebouwen worden met klassieke zuilen versierd. Bij mij roepen al die zuilen eerder een gevoel van slechte imitatie op.</div><br />

  <h3>3 July 2009</h3>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-03-amelanchier-shadbush-juneberry-sugar-plum-inventory-for-ann-arbor-2009/">Amelanchier (Shadbush, Juneberry, Sugar Plum) inventory for Ann Arbor, 2009</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s a complete list of where all of the Amelanchier (juneberry, shadbush, sugar plum depending on where you are from) trees are on the public streets in Ann Arbor.&#0160; The complete inventory shows 356 trees, each geocoded; rather than try to pin them on a map, this is by street name in alphabetical order, with quite a bit of duplicates eliminated.</p>
<p>The whole program to do this is</p>
<p>grep -i Amelanchier trees09.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3, &quot;between&quot;, $4, &quot;and &quot; $5}&#39; | sort | uniq &gt; juneberry.txt</p>
<p>where the trees09.csv file is downloadable from the Ann Arbor Chronicle who originally sourced this data from the city of Ann Arbor; <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/07/01/city-and-residents-to-make-tree-policy/">see their story about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Alas this post is a little bit too late for this season; by July 2, 2009, many of the juneberry trees are completely ripe, so get picking.</p>
