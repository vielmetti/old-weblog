    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Also known as &quot;retcon&quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &#0160;As pulled from the notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon (at least today): &quot;Retroactive continuity&quot; was shortened to &quot;retcon&quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&#0160;USENET. Hard evidence of Cugley&#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &quot;The originator of the word &#39;retcon&#39;.&quot;[5]&#0160;Cugley used the newly-shortened word to describe a development in the comic book&#0160;Saga of the Swamp Thing, which reinterprets the events of the title character&#39;s origin by revealing facts that, up to that point, are not part of the narrative and were not intended by earlier writers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-05-retroactive-continuity/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Rankings impose discipline on markets: Wendy&#0160;Espeland&#39;s&#0160;A Different Kind of Quantitative Sociology&#0160;talk at ICOS in 2008: Third is&#0160;discipline&#0160;(here comes the Foucault!). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers. Espeland draws here on her recent work on US News and World Report law school rankings. For example, because the rankings counted median LSAT scores of only regular full-time students, law schools began to push weaker applicants into doing part-time and night programs. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-04-run-by-the-numbers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Bloom filter, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970,[1] is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-16-bloom-filter---wikipedia-the-free-encyclopedia/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The basic idea of a non-imaging light concentrator is that if you just want bright light in a particular spot and don’t care about making the light form an optical image, you can just generally reflect random light into the desired place. The concentrated light then illuminates any subject in that spot from all sides, making a very bright yet diffuse light. This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-16-domesticated-crickets-and-the-cone-macro-flash-concentrator-the-backyard-arthropod-project/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Rankings, an ordinal list, can result from tests or from contests. Start with contests, and take first the forms in which competitors play against each other. The score in such a contest indicates which player (team) performed better (earned more runs or goals, ran faster, jumped higher) against another or others on a given day. The score of a soccer match is the result of a direct, head to head competition.&nbsp; And the aggregation of these scores (in, for example, win-loss records) results in rankings – whether it be a soccer league or of all the professional tennis players or of all the Grand Master chess players in the world.&nbsp; Note that in such contests there are referees and timekeepers but not judges. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-16-from-prices-to-prizes-competitions-orgtheorynet/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>That&#39;s a question I often pose at the beginning of projects, and one that I struggle with often when there is no simple answer.&#0160; Some reflection has me thinking it might be too simple a question to pose when goals are complex and long term and emergent. I&#39;ll illustrate with a project that by some multiple measures has been successful so far, my weekly lunch meeting called a2b3.&#0160; Every week we gather for lunch, people eat, they talk, they leave.&#0160; At various times I&#39;ve tried to determine what to tally up to see if I&#39;m doing the right thing, and no number that I make visible ever holds up to repeated fixation.&#0160; How do you measure success of a weekly meeting?&#0160; There&#39;s one simple measure of attendance, though we have filled the restaurant and don&#39;t plan to move so there&#39;s no real way to grow beyond the 20 to 30 or so that are normally there.&#0160; When on the odd week that there&#39;s a low turnout of 15 the lunch is so different and enjoyable that that feels like success too.&#0160; I find myself counting the number of people who are long time regulars, and also counting the number of people who are new.&#0160; Both seem like good people to have.&#0160; It can take a while to meet someone new until there&#39;s some other good connection, so my ability to add people to my world seems fixed - if the whole group was either people I already knew or people I didn&#39;t know that would be a challenge. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-15-how-do-you-measure-successthats-a-question-i-often-pose-at-the-beginning-of-projects-and-one-that-i-struggle-with-often-whe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Copied in its entirety from the Iowa, City IA city government web page in their "Public Art" section. King-Littrell-Palmer Chicken Hatchery Irving King, head of the University of Iowa Department of Literature, had an unusual sideline for an English professor: raising chickens. In 1918, King started a hatchery as a hobby on the south side of Jackson Avenue. Eventually, the hatchery occupied several wood structures from Sheridan Avenue to Ralston Creek between the alley and Rundell Street. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-14-the-lost-chicken-hatcheries-of-iowa-city-ia/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Aardvark is vark.com - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &#0160;It&#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &quot;your network&quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&#39;s capable of doing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-13-practicing-questions-with-aardvark/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The challenge is to get rid of some set of books that have accumulated, while simultaneously fulfilling the need to always have some kind of new reading in the house. &#0160; A new (to me) way to do this is Paperback Swap, a system which works as a trading board for books. &#0160;You are entitled to books in the proportion that you send books to others, and every book you request is free to you. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-13-discardia-for-midsummer-2010-paperback-swap/">&raquo;</a></p>
