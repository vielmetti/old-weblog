<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.</p>
<p>Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted.</p>
<p>Progress is a hard thing to measure with any degree of certainty. &#0160;&quot;Increase the n&quot; is one typical useful task, as though by heaping on one more of whatever it is that you are counting you can get one measure closer to ultimate success. &#0160;&quot;Decrease the n&quot; is the other task, which generally for me is the Sisyphian task of emptying the inbox or washing the dishes. &#0160;You&#39;re never really done, and the only progress you note is that something happened today.</p>
<p>The meaningless indicator of progress can simply be the recognition that you have hit some temporary and attainable local high point to the day, and that even if tomorrow brings you back to a spot where you need to do more, you at least did what you needed to do today. &#0160;Shining the sink is the domestic equivalent of inbox zero; yes, there still may be more to do tomorrow, but at least for today you&#39;re at the bottom of what needs to be done.</p>

The working structure for the talk is the 5 minute or so talk I give at the beginning of every a2b3 meeting, with the little ritual introduction of the group and the origin story and the monologue.  I think it will work out; heaven knows that I've had some practice.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.</p>

<p>I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz. So off it goes, at least for now. Let Twitter be Twitter.</p>

<p>I suspect that blog-related stuff should land here, since there's at least some pretense that it should be longer. I almost wish there was a one-pass "post this to my blog too"; indeed, the first draft of this was written in Buzz, until I figured that it really should be posted to Vacuum and then pulled into Buzz through the feed. I guess. I hope that works.</p>

<p>It's always nice to try out some new communications system, especially one that makes you rethink your use of all of the old systems you had gotten out of the habit of using. I've also liked which random people from my address book that Google decided should be my first set of friends; they did a pretty good job.</p>

      <p>I've changed the title of this blog back to Vacuum, since all of the extra gobbledygook was making it hard to bookmark things.</p>
<p>The "quick compose" part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don't have titles, so I don't get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type.  Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like.</p>

<p></p><h4>THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO</h4><h5>How to Get Things Right</h5><p>Atul Gawande</p>

<p>Excerpt from Freakonomics review</p>
<blockquote>
Even more interesting are the stories about Walmart’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the real reason why David Lee Roth used to demand that there be a bowl of M&amp;M’s with all the brown ones removed in his dressing room backstage.</blockquote>

<p>Times Online <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article6995508.ece">review</a></p>

<blockquote>The surgeon-author was on the track of what might be described as a classic magic bullet — a low-tech way in a high-tech, expensive world in which lives might be saved and costs reduced. Gawande, using his own word, was searching for “eptitude” — the business of making sure that those with knowledge applied it effectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following checklist is designed to aid the checklist creation process and ensure that your checklist helps instead of hurts. &#0160;It was created by Dr. Atul Gawande, the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital Center for Surgery and Public Health Dissemination Team, and Dan Boorman of Boeing.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The nicest wiki implementation of checklists I&#39;ve seen is at Sunshine Review, using the MediaWiki dpl extension.</p>

<p>Another review, in <a href="https://www.indiacurrents.com/articles/2010/06/04/from-ignorance-to-ineptitude-to-eptitude">India Currents</a> 2010:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But does novelty really matter when lives are at stake? In a
recent New York Times article about implementing checklists, Dr.
Peter Pronovost (whose contribution Gawande  acknowledges) exclaimed
that “You would have thought I started World War III.” He then
asserted that having nurses check to ensure that doctors washed
their hands has “gotten infection rates down to almost zero in the
ICU.” With success like that, patients are probably saying, “Thank
you very much, Dr. Gawande. Your manifesto may not be War and Peace,
but it has saved more lives than Tolstoy’s novel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pronovost is interviewed in a Wall Street Journal article,
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704364004576131963185893084">The Secret to Fighting Infections</a>,
from 2011:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pronovost&rsquo;s boyish appearance and enthusiastic manner belie a steely determination to challenge the status quo in medicine. He hasn&rsquo;t shied away from criticizing his peers for resisting safety and quality improvement efforts, a theme of his 2009 book &ldquo;Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

      <p><span class="il">Networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span>: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, <strong>James Whitacre</strong> and <strong>Axel Bender</strong>, 2009/12/10, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1961">arXiv:0912.1961</a></p><blockquote><p>Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called <span class="il">networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span> hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.</p></blockquote><p>Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&#39;s my interpretation.&#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.</p><p>The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are <strong>flexible and reconfigurable</strong> (&quot;versatile&quot;).&#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.</p><p>The second note is the that the agents are <strong>diverse</strong> (oddly, in this language, &quot;degenerate&quot;) in their skills.&#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&#0160; </p><p>Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&#0160;&#0160; For any individual task, there&#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&#0160; </p><p>I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&#0160; I haven&#39;t even made sense yet of the &quot;network buffering&quot; piece.&#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.</p><p></p>

oil began to move and form thick ridges and thin troughs, a stage that
some recipes refer to as the oil “rippling.” As the temperature kept
climbing, the thin areas spread out and the ridges became fewer and
higher. The pattern reminded me of the long drops that run down the
inside of a glass of wine or spirits. Eventually the thin areas seemed
to run completely dry, and most of the oil had collected in a ring
around the pan edge. </p><p>With some research, I soon learned that I
had been observing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9nard_cells">Bénard-Marangoni convection</a>, which is related to
Marangoni convection in a wineglass. Uneven temperatures at the pan
surface cause regional differences in the oil’s surface tension, and
this causes the oil to get pulled toward the cooler areas.</p></blockquote>When the oil is at the right heat, pour in enough popping corn in the pan to make a layer of kernels a single kernel deep.&#0160;&#0160; Shake the pot around so that all of the kernels get a very thin coating of hot oil.&#0160; If there&#39;s any excess oil pooling around, you&#39;ve put<br />too much in.<br /><br />Put the pot back on the heat - again, it&#39;s <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on our stove - and keep the lid in while it pops.&#0160; Shake the pan back and forth every so often.&#0160; When the popping stops, take the pan off the heat.<br /><br /><strong>Cinnamon Popcorn Cereal</strong><br /><br />a recipe from Jonathan<br /><br />Fresh popped popcorn<br />Cinnamon<br />Milk<br /><br />Pour fresh popped popcorn in a bowl.&#0160; Sprinkle cinnamon on top.

      <p>YPSILANTI - A very straightforward yet revolutionary approach to open meetings in Ypsilanti says that every subcommittee of City Council must abide by the Michigan Open Meetings Act - including providing advance notice of meetings - just in case enough council members show up to form a quorum.<p><a href="http://ypsiciti.com/section/News/Ypsi+broadens+scope+of+Open+Meetings+Act-article-1325.html">Ypsilanti Citizen story</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The OMA resolution, which was added to council’s agenda at 5 p.m. on
Oct. 20, was discussed in relation to the approval of the Ypsilanti
Downtown Development Authority bylaws - a separate agenda item at the
meeting. </p><p>Murdock said the resolution is simply about “having meetings where decisions are made open to the public.” </p><p>Although
he had previous discussions with City Manager Ed Koryzno during
Council’s goal-setting sessions in January, Murdock moved forward with
the resolution Oct. 20, when the DDA violated the Open Meetings Act
earlier in the month by having a quorum, or more than seven members of
the board, participate at a planning committee meeting. </p></blockquote><p>the <a href="http://advanceypsilanti.com/?p=655">Advance Ypsilanti PAC</a> notes that the resolution snuck in at the last possible minute</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sadly, the process by which this open meetings resolution
was enacted is exactly the opposite of an open process. This is not
just ironic, but suspect.</strong></p><p>For instance, consider that this resolution was sent to the city
clerk and posted to the council packets at 4:16 p.m. the day of the
city council meeting, <em><strong>less than 3 hours </strong></em>before
council was to convene. AY PAC asks ‘why’? There was no emergency, no
timeline that needed to be met on this issue. There was no pressing
need that forced this to be addressed and resolved THAT NIGHT.</p><p>If anyone can inform AY PAC as to why this was so urgent that it
needed to be addressed in a timeline that included NO opportunity for
public comment and little reflection by council, we welcome the
information.</p></blockquote><p>The back story is the Ypsi DDA meeting in October 2008 which was held in closed session, in evident violation of the Open Meetings Act.&#0160; <a href="http://ypsinews.com/index.php/200810-ypsilanti-dda-violates-open-meetings-act-twice-in-one-meeting/comment-page-1/">From YpsiNews (Steve Pierce) at the time:</a></p><blockquote><p>(October 7, 2008) During a meeting of the <a href="http://www.ypsilantidda.org/" target="_blank">Ypsilanti Downtown Development</a>, the DDA board violated not one, but two sections of the Open Meetings Act.</p><p>The Director of the Ypsilanti DDA, Brian Vosburg, called an
emergency closed session meeting to be held on Friday, October 3, 2008
at 12 noon. The purpose of the meeting was to meet with DDA attorney
Tammie Tischler. </p><p>The DDA Director said in the meeting notice the “Closed Session (is)
to consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure by state or
federal statute - (Open Meetings Act 15.268, Section 8(h))”</p><p>However, neither the DDA Director nor the DDA attorney would cite
which state or federal statute exempts the DDA from the Open Meetings
Act. Failing to publicly state the reason for a closed session is a
violation of the Open Meetings Act.</p></blockquote><p></p></p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been writing a &quot;FOIA Friday&quot; series at AnnArbor.com, and the thought has started to occur to me that it would be a lot easier to write it if I had another blog to use to cut and paste clippings into so that I had more material to work from.</p><p>So, prepare for a new FOIA blog at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/foia">http://vielmetti.typepad.com/foia</a> which doesn&#39;t have a clever name yet but will serve as a place to collect stuff that&#39;s relevant and interesting to open government issues, yet out of scope for the newspaper.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There&#39;s a wide variety of quality in people&#39;s ability to express themselves in written form, and an &quot;email interview&quot; is one way of assessing this.&#0160; This generally takes the form of a set of questions provided to the interviewee to be answered by them using whatever means they have to prepare a suitable answer.&#0160; You will often find that it takes some time to get a response back, especially if there are a lot of questions or if the questions are hard.<br /><br />Frankly, I&#39;m disappointed that more people don&#39;t spend the time on getting better at both writing written questions and in responding to them.&#0160; A well-written set of questions, thought through in advance, can give a candidate or any other interview subject time to prepare and reflect on the tone they wish to project.&#0160; This can be very instructive when compared to the same person&#39;s behavior in an unreflective, spontaneous, unscripted moment.&#0160; In addition, email leaves a trail and a public record and you know how useful it is to have a public record to refer to from time to time rather than private, unreliable personal notes.<br /><br />I know that the stereotype is the ink-stained reporter clutching the steno pad grabbing a good phrase here and there.&#0160; But there needs to be more attention to how people present themselves in email, especially given how much municipal business is transacted through the email.&#0160; I am certain that a reporter is capable of being just as tough and as hard-nosed via written form to members of government and candidates for elected office - just as good elected officials are skilled in the art of writing pointed requests for information from agencies and departments in order to get at the details they want.</p>

      <p>http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/decline.txt</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">In this book, Gregory Feist reviews and consolidates the scattered
literatures on the psychology of science, then calls for the
establishment of the field as a unique discipline. He offers the most
comprehensive perspective yet on how science came to be possible in our
species and on the important role of psychological forces in an
individual’s development of scientific interest, talent, and
creativity. Without a psychological perspective, Feist argues, we
cannot fully understand the development of scientific thinking or
scientific genius.</p><p>say something about Manfred Kochen and the slow accumulation of intellectual debts reflected in bibliographies</p>
