        <p>Tom Munnecke reminds me of a slow conversation we have been having for a few years. &#0160;I noted it here about five years ago.&#0160;&#0160;Five years is a pretty good time to stretch out a single line of thinking, so it&#39;s worthwhile reflecting on how much current writing structure allows for some amount of leisurely conversation in the face of a daily deadline. The hard part about taking a question slowly is that most of what I end up writing for AnnArbor.com is done with a short deadline. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-16-slow-conversations-with-a-daily-deadline/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Also known as &quot;retcon&quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &#0160;As pulled from the notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon (at least today): &quot;Retroactive continuity&quot; was shortened to &quot;retcon&quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&#0160;USENET. Hard evidence of Cugley&#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &quot;The originator of the word &#39;retcon&#39;.&quot;[5]&#0160;Cugley used the newly-shortened word to describe a development in the comic book&#0160;Saga of the Swamp Thing, which reinterprets the events of the title character&#39;s origin by revealing facts that, up to that point, are not part of the narrative and were not intended by earlier writers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-05-retroactive-continuity/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Rankings impose discipline on markets: Wendy&#0160;Espeland&#39;s&#0160;A Different Kind of Quantitative Sociology&#0160;talk at ICOS in 2008: Third is&#0160;discipline&#0160;(here comes the Foucault!). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers. Espeland draws here on her recent work on US News and World Report law school rankings. For example, because the rankings counted median LSAT scores of only regular full-time students, law schools began to push weaker applicants into doing part-time and night programs. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-04-run-by-the-numbers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Bloom filter, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970,[1] is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-16-bloom-filter---wikipedia-the-free-encyclopedia/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The basic idea of a non-imaging light concentrator is that if you just want bright light in a particular spot and don’t care about making the light form an optical image, you can just generally reflect random light into the desired place. The concentrated light then illuminates any subject in that spot from all sides, making a very bright yet diffuse light. This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-16-domesticated-crickets-and-the-cone-macro-flash-concentrator-the-backyard-arthropod-project/">&raquo;</a></p>
