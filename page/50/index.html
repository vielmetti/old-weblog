<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<blockquote>In an exploration of fictional tools for hibernators, Susanna Hertrich developed the Chrono_shredder, a product that serves as a reminder to live one&#39;s life productively. The 365-day calendar is dispensed day-by-day from a single roll, each day shredded over an exact 24-hour period.</blockquote>
<p>I can imagine creating the counterpart to this work, a calendar which is a fax machine connected to a phone line that faxes in, slowly, line by line, the image of the next day&#39;s calendar page. I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide what bit rate corresponds to one 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; calendar page per day.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s harvest time, which means there are a lot of recipes you can do with food that you can buy locally. One thing that would help that a lot is finding the people who buy the same stuff you do, and who share the same tastes, and who can work with you to figure out how to stock up so you have enough on your shelves always to get a meal on the table.</p>
<p>The approach that seems best is to come up with a harvest calendar for each kind of produce that you enjoy, and then to use it as a set of filters into which you set in a bunch of recipes.</p>
<p>The end result could be as simple as tuning in to the local markets, figuring out what is exceptionally good quality or good value at the moment, and then getting back a list of recipes that takes advantage of that. For the handful of things that only show up once a year for a short season (quince, paw paws) you want to anticipate that with recipes so that when they do show you are ready to go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Also known as &quot;retcon&quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &#0160;As pulled from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity" target="_self">notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon</a> (at least today):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Retroactive continuity&quot; was shortened to &quot;retcon&quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USENET" title="USENET">USENET</a>. Hard evidence of Cugley&#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &quot;The originator of the word &#39;retcon&#39;.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup>&#0160;Cugley used the newly-shortened word to describe a development in the comic book&#0160;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_of_the_Swamp_Thing" title="Saga of the Swamp Thing">Saga of the Swamp Thing</a></em>, which reinterprets the events of the title character&#39;s origin by revealing facts that, up to that point, are not part of the narrative and were not intended by earlier writers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia conveniently doesn&#39;t yet include <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics/browse_thread/thread/9d31a64739cb54e3/7e01d8472da63f0?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=retcon" target="_self">this post from rec.arts.comics from Steve Simmons</a>&#0160;in 1989:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear, hear! &#0160;&quot;Crisis On Infinite Earths&quot; solved a DC crisis all right,&#0160;but it wasn&#39;t the problem of having multiple earths. &#0160;It was the problem&#0160;of 50 years of continuity complicating their existing characters. &#0160;DC&#0160;had been either ignoring the continuity (which led to contradiction and&#0160;reader frustration) or attempting to adhere to it, effectively hamstringing&#0160;them (&quot;remember, we solved that one back in &#39;42&quot;). &#0160;&quot;Crisis&quot; let DC have&#0160;good reason to&#0160;<strong>retcon</strong>&#0160;characters to whatever extent needed -- heck, it&#0160;practically demanded it.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implanting false memories can also be useful for the corporate persona, where parts of the corporate origin story get rewritten to suit the current corporate branding. If you don&#39;t have strong documentation for the past - or if no one really cares - you can pull together a selective narrative that picks out the parts of the history that highlight the best parts of the present.&#0160;</p>

      <p>Rankings impose discipline on markets: Wendy&#0160;Espeland&#39;s&#0160;<a href="http://asociologist.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/notes-from-icos-espeland-a-different-kind-of-quantitative-sociology/" target="_self">A Different Kind of Quantitative Sociology</a>&#0160;talk at ICOS in 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third is&#0160;<em>discipline</em>&#0160;(<a href="http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/where-in-the-world-is-michel-foucault/">here comes the Foucault!</a>). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers. Espeland draws here on her recent work on US News and World Report law school rankings. For example, because the rankings counted median LSAT scores of only regular full-time students, law schools began to push weaker applicants into doing part-time and night programs. In response to a proposal by US News to start including those programs in the median LSAT calculations, law schools formed committees to ponder reforming or closing their night and part-time programs. Organizational discipline in action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of the argument has 5 bullet points</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantification takes work</li>
<li>Quantification changes what it measures</li>
<li>Quantification imposes discipline on those who are measured</li>
<li>Numbers are seen as authoritative</li>
<li>Numbers are powerful for their aesthetic qualities</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202444960579&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1" target="_self">National Law Journal takes on the impact</a> of this in May 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>U.S. News</em>&#0160;does maintain a law school &quot;diversity index,&quot; but those data are not a factor in the overall rankings.&#0160;<br /><br />&quot;A lot of people we interviewed expressed concern over the impact of rankings on diversity,&quot; said Wendy Espeland, an assistant professor of sociology at Northwestern University. &quot;The overarching tension between catering to the rankings and doing what you think is best for your school is intense.&quot;&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every once in a while I invoke the phrase &quot;quality without a number&quot;; most recently, I guess, in a post on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/reification-is.html" target="_self">Reification is an Ontological Imperative</a>, also from 2008. <a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2008/04/14/detroit-presentation-the-politics-of-metrics/" target="_self">&#0160;Ed Yourdon&#39;s The Politics of Metrics</a> has the same theme.</p>

The truth in a calm world, <br />In which there is no other meaning, itself<br /><br />Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself<br />Is the reader leaning late and reading there.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />— Wallace Stevens</blockquote>

<p>In a 1969 speech against war protesters, he said, &quot;A spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals.&quot; &quot;In the United States today,&quot; Agnew told a 1970 audience in San Diego, &quot;we have more than our share of the nattering nabobs of negativism.&quot; He went after &quot;pusillanimous pussyfooters&quot; and &quot;vicars of vacillation&quot; and &quot;the hopeless, hysterical hypochondriacs of history.&quot;</p>

      <blockquote><p>The basic idea of a non-imaging light concentrator is that if you just want bright light in a particular spot and don’t care about making the light form an optical image, you can just generally reflect random light into the desired place.  The concentrated light then illuminates any subject in that spot from all sides, making a very bright yet diffuse light. This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography. So, how about if I design one that will catch most of the light from my on-camera flash, and direct the bulk of it into the relatively small volume that I actually want to illuminate?</p>

      <blockquote><p>Rankings, an ordinal list, can result from tests or from contests. Start with contests, and take first the forms in which competitors play against each other. The score in such a contest indicates which player (team) performed better (earned more runs or goals, ran faster, jumped higher) against another or others on a given day. The score of a soccer match is the result of a direct, head to head competition.&nbsp; And the aggregation of these scores (in, for example, win-loss records) results in rankings – whether it be a soccer league or of all the professional tennis players or of all the Grand Master chess players in the world.&nbsp; Note that in such contests there are referees and timekeepers but not judges. Technology contests (e.g., solving the problem of determining latitude on the open sea, building the fastest computer, the lightest airplane, robotic cars on ever-more challenging terrain) operate according to similar principles.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>That&#39;s a question I often pose at the beginning of projects, and one that I struggle with often when there is no simple answer.&#0160; Some reflection has me thinking it might be too simple a question to pose when goals are complex and long term and emergent.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll illustrate with a project that by some multiple measures has been successful so far, my weekly lunch meeting called a2b3.&#0160; Every week we gather for lunch, people eat, they talk, they leave.&#0160; At various times I&#39;ve tried to determine what to tally up to see if I&#39;m doing the right thing, and no number that I make visible ever holds up to repeated fixation.&#0160;</p>
<p>How do you measure success of a weekly meeting?&#0160; There&#39;s one simple measure of attendance, though we have filled the restaurant and don&#39;t plan to move so there&#39;s no real way to grow beyond the 20 to 30 or so that are normally there.&#0160; When on the odd week that there&#39;s a low turnout of 15 the lunch is so different and enjoyable that that feels like success too.&#0160;</p>
<p>I find myself counting the number of people who are long time regulars, and also counting the number of people who are new.&#0160; Both seem like good people to have.&#0160; It can take a while to meet someone new until there&#39;s some other good connection, so my ability to add people to my world seems fixed - if the whole group was either people I already knew or people I didn&#39;t know that would be a challenge.</p>
<p>I also count the message traffic on the mailing list. &#0160;Email lists have some amount of channel capacity, so you want to have the list be busy enough to occupy the channel but not so busy that they cause people to turn it off or so idle that people forget it&#39;s there.</p>
<p>There is a degree of diversity to the group that surprises me, and what&#39;s more it surprises me that I don&#39;t need to do deliberate recruiting of anyone in order to get the occasional undergraduate or high school student or person from out of town or other demographic outlier to arrive.&#0160; It&#39;s perhaps because I don&#39;t keep track that makes it possible to be pleasantly surprised by how it feels like a broad cross-section of a corner of town.</p>
<p><strong>One easy measure of success is how well the group self-organizes when I&#39;m not there.&#0160;</strong>Some part of years of what might retrospectively be considered thoughtful planning is some zen quality of not needing to plan very much at all. &#0160;When I&#39;m not there, something still happens.</p>
<p>Traditional &quot;economic development&quot; organizations crow about their ability to attract or retain jobs, the number of events they organize, the value of square inches of favorable newsprint copy in ad-equivalent dollars, or the square feet of real estate they helped cause to be occupied. Those are all useful measurements when you&#39;re spending tax dollars, so that people doing accounting can have something to count. &#0160;But if all you are spending is lunch money, you better have a way to count on goodwill building up over time - credit toward some future, rather than a precise reckoning of the present.</p>
