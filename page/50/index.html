<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>

      </h3>
      <p><span class="il">Networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span>: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, <strong>James Whitacre</strong> and <strong>Axel Bender</strong>, 2009/12/10, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1961">arXiv:0912.1961</a></p><blockquote><p>Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called <span class="il">networked</span> <span class="il">buffering</span> hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.</p></blockquote><p>Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&#39;s my interpretation.&#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.</p><p>The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are <strong>flexible and reconfigurable</strong> (&quot;versatile&quot;).&#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.</p><p>The second note is the that the agents are <strong>diverse</strong> (oddly, in this language, &quot;degenerate&quot;) in their skills.&#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&#0160; </p><p>Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&#0160;&#0160; For any individual task, there&#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&#0160; </p><p>I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&#0160; I haven&#39;t even made sense yet of the &quot;network buffering&quot; piece.&#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.</p><p></p>

      <p><strong>Popcorn</strong><br /><br />canola oil<br />popping corn<br /><br /><p>Heat a sturdy deep pot with a lid to the same temperature you&#39;d use for low temperature sauteing; on our stove it&#39;s 6 of 10.&#0160; When the pot is properly warmed up, pour a bit of oil on the bottom (about a tablespoon or a little more) and bring that up to heat.&#0160; I know it&#39;s at the right temperature when the thin layer of oil starts to form standing waves, ridges, or ripples.&#0160; If it starts to smoke, it&#39;s too hot; if it&#39;s a completely flat layer of oil, it&#39;s too cold.</p><p>What is that ripple effect?&#0160; From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/08curi.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=harold%20mcgee&amp;st=cse">Harold McGee, The Curious Cook in the New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As the temperature of the pan surface rose above 350 degrees, the
oil began to move and form thick ridges and thin troughs, a stage that
some recipes refer to as the oil “rippling.” As the temperature kept
climbing, the thin areas spread out and the ridges became fewer and
higher. The pattern reminded me of the long drops that run down the
inside of a glass of wine or spirits. Eventually the thin areas seemed
to run completely dry, and most of the oil had collected in a ring
around the pan edge. </p><p>With some research, I soon learned that I
had been observing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9nard_cells">Bénard-Marangoni convection</a>, which is related to
Marangoni convection in a wineglass. Uneven temperatures at the pan
surface cause regional differences in the oil’s surface tension, and
this causes the oil to get pulled toward the cooler areas.</p></blockquote>When the oil is at the right heat, pour in enough popping corn in the pan to make a layer of kernels a single kernel deep.&#0160;&#0160; Shake the pot around so that all of the kernels get a very thin coating of hot oil.&#0160; If there&#39;s any excess oil pooling around, you&#39;ve put<br />too much in.<br /><br />Put the pot back on the heat - again, it&#39;s <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> on our stove - and keep the lid in while it pops.&#0160; Shake the pan back and forth every so often.&#0160; When the popping stops, take the pan off the heat.<br /><br /><strong>Cinnamon Popcorn Cereal</strong><br /><br />a recipe from Jonathan<br /><br />Fresh popped popcorn<br />Cinnamon<br />Milk<br /><br />Pour fresh popped popcorn in a bowl.&#0160; Sprinkle cinnamon on top.

      <p>This is such a curious story that I want to preserve bits of it as they appeared, to help better make sense of it.</p>

<p>The back story is that some veterans of the &quot;strike newspaper&quot; industry decided they could make a go of doing a new daily Detroit paper, with delivery.</p>

<p>They launched to the point of being able to print a week&#39;s worth of paper, then abruptly shut down.</p>

<p><a href="http://detnews.com/article/20091127/BIZ/911270419/Detroit-newspaper-suspends-publication">The Detroit News:</a> </p><blockquote><p>&quot;Due to circumstances beyond our control, lack of advertising, lateness of our press runs and lack of distribution and sales,
we find it necessary to temporarily suspend publication of the Detroit
Daily Press until after the (first) of the year,&quot; the statement read.
&quot;Once we can fix these things, we plan to be back stronger and more
organized when we return. This is just a bump in the road and not the
end of the Detroit Daily Press.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
While 3,500 sounds like a lot, I’d hazard that one could easily find 100,000 retail spots, or more, pretty easily in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties, so the paper might be harder to find that some might expect.

I looked at a few downtown Detroit places at lunchtime with no luck. I’ll check again later and pop up to Royal Oak so I can get a copy to dissect for you on here. Stay tuned.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Surprising &ndash; yet not surprising &ndash; news out of the new Detroit Daily Press. The city&#39;s new paper says it needs to regroup. Editors and writers now have a five-week vacation to see what happens.</p>

<p>Many friends were working there, and they were the ones who took the buyouts or were laid off from The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press. I&#39;m sad to see an enterprise that could have been an exciting addition to the community fall so quickly. </p></blockquote><p>Media critic Jay Rosen had <a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/statuses/5701774547">only this cryptic comment</a> on the situation:</p><blockquote><p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Not a single thing do I get about this story.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-11-10-ypsilanti-michigan-to-adopt-more-stringent-open-meetings-act-rules/">Ypsilanti, Michigan to adopt more stringent Open Meetings Act rules</a>
      </h3>
      <p>YPSILANTI - A very straightforward yet revolutionary approach to open meetings in Ypsilanti says that every subcommittee of City Council must abide by the Michigan Open Meetings Act - including providing advance notice of meetings - just in case enough council members show up to form a quorum.<p><a href="http://ypsiciti.com/section/News/Ypsi+broadens+scope+of+Open+Meetings+Act-article-1325.html">Ypsilanti Citizen story</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The OMA resolution, which was added to council’s agenda at 5 p.m. on
Oct. 20, was discussed in relation to the approval of the Ypsilanti
Downtown Development Authority bylaws - a separate agenda item at the
meeting. </p><p>Murdock said the resolution is simply about “having meetings where decisions are made open to the public.” </p><p>Although
he had previous discussions with City Manager Ed Koryzno during
Council’s goal-setting sessions in January, Murdock moved forward with
the resolution Oct. 20, when the DDA violated the Open Meetings Act
earlier in the month by having a quorum, or more than seven members of
the board, participate at a planning committee meeting. </p></blockquote><p>the <a href="http://advanceypsilanti.com/?p=655">Advance Ypsilanti PAC</a> notes that the resolution snuck in at the last possible minute</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sadly, the process by which this open meetings resolution
was enacted is exactly the opposite of an open process. This is not
just ironic, but suspect.</strong></p><p>For instance, consider that this resolution was sent to the city
clerk and posted to the council packets at 4:16 p.m. the day of the
city council meeting, <em><strong>less than 3 hours </strong></em>before
council was to convene. AY PAC asks ‘why’? There was no emergency, no
timeline that needed to be met on this issue. There was no pressing
need that forced this to be addressed and resolved THAT NIGHT.</p><p>If anyone can inform AY PAC as to why this was so urgent that it
needed to be addressed in a timeline that included NO opportunity for
public comment and little reflection by council, we welcome the
information.</p></blockquote><p>The back story is the Ypsi DDA meeting in October 2008 which was held in closed session, in evident violation of the Open Meetings Act.&#0160; <a href="http://ypsinews.com/index.php/200810-ypsilanti-dda-violates-open-meetings-act-twice-in-one-meeting/comment-page-1/">From YpsiNews (Steve Pierce) at the time:</a></p><blockquote><p>(October 7, 2008) During a meeting of the <a href="http://www.ypsilantidda.org/" target="_blank">Ypsilanti Downtown Development</a>, the DDA board violated not one, but two sections of the Open Meetings Act.</p><p>The Director of the Ypsilanti DDA, Brian Vosburg, called an
emergency closed session meeting to be held on Friday, October 3, 2008
at 12 noon. The purpose of the meeting was to meet with DDA attorney
Tammie Tischler. </p><p>The DDA Director said in the meeting notice the “Closed Session (is)
to consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure by state or
federal statute - (Open Meetings Act 15.268, Section 8(h))”</p><p>However, neither the DDA Director nor the DDA attorney would cite
which state or federal statute exempts the DDA from the Open Meetings
Act. Failing to publicly state the reason for a closed session is a
violation of the Open Meetings Act.</p></blockquote><p></p></p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been writing a &quot;FOIA Friday&quot; series at AnnArbor.com, and the thought has started to occur to me that it would be a lot easier to write it if I had another blog to use to cut and paste clippings into so that I had more material to work from.</p><p>So, prepare for a new FOIA blog at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/foia">http://vielmetti.typepad.com/foia</a> which doesn&#39;t have a clever name yet but will serve as a place to collect stuff that&#39;s relevant and interesting to open government issues, yet out of scope for the newspaper.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There&#39;s a wide variety of quality in people&#39;s ability to express themselves in written form, and an &quot;email interview&quot; is one way of assessing this.&#0160; This generally takes the form of a set of questions provided to the interviewee to be answered by them using whatever means they have to prepare a suitable answer.&#0160; You will often find that it takes some time to get a response back, especially if there are a lot of questions or if the questions are hard.<br /><br />Frankly, I&#39;m disappointed that more people don&#39;t spend the time on getting better at both writing written questions and in responding to them.&#0160; A well-written set of questions, thought through in advance, can give a candidate or any other interview subject time to prepare and reflect on the tone they wish to project.&#0160; This can be very instructive when compared to the same person&#39;s behavior in an unreflective, spontaneous, unscripted moment.&#0160; In addition, email leaves a trail and a public record and you know how useful it is to have a public record to refer to from time to time rather than private, unreliable personal notes.<br /><br />I know that the stereotype is the ink-stained reporter clutching the steno pad grabbing a good phrase here and there.&#0160; But there needs to be more attention to how people present themselves in email, especially given how much municipal business is transacted through the email.&#0160; I am certain that a reporter is capable of being just as tough and as hard-nosed via written form to members of government and candidates for elected office - just as good elected officials are skilled in the art of writing pointed requests for information from agencies and departments in order to get at the details they want.</p>

literatures on the psychology of science, then calls for the
establishment of the field as a unique discipline. He offers the most
comprehensive perspective yet on how science came to be possible in our
species and on the important role of psychological forces in an
individual’s development of scientific interest, talent, and
creativity. Without a psychological perspective, Feist argues, we
cannot fully understand the development of scientific thinking or
scientific genius.</p><p>say something about Manfred Kochen and the slow accumulation of intellectual debts reflected in bibliographies</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Recipe adapted from directions and shopping hints from Molly at
Farmer's Market.</p>
<p><strong>Molly's October squash soup</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>onion</li>
<li>garlic</li>
<li>ginger</li>
<li>winter squash, peeled and diced (I used butternut and delicata)</li>
<li>coconut milk</li>
<li>diced tomatoes</li>
<li>stock (vegetable or chicken)</li>
</ul>

<p><p>Saute onion, garlic, and ginger in olive or coconut oil.&nbsp;
Add the squash, cook until everything smells nice and the squash is
a little bit browned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deglaze the pan with a little
wine (I used rice wine), then add diced tomatoes, coconut milk, and
hot stock.</p>

<p>Bring to a boil then simmer covered for a long time until
everything is well cooked and soft.&nbsp; Next time I&rsquo;ll blend the
soup so that it&rsquo;s a puree, but we ate it tonight without doing
that, and it was still delicious - much, much better than last
year&rsquo;s bland pumpkin soup attempt.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it was the
coconut!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Age 79, died September 23 2009. Born on July 10, 1930 in Detroit, MI
the only child of Albert Frank Aberdeen and Leona Winifred Cozzens
Aberdeen. In 1961, David married Virginia Ray Ackley of Oakdale
California. They were married 36 years when she predeceased him in
1997. Together they had two sons, David Hall and John Stuart. David
spent his first 8 years in Detroit before moving to Portage Lake, where
he graduated from Pinckney High School in 1948. He attended Albion
College in his freshman year before transferring to the University of
Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1952 and then
earned a Masters degree in education from the University of Michigan in
1954. He began his long public school career in Chicago, where he
taught elementary school for five years, as well as night classes in
English as a Second Language. He then returned to Ann Arbor where he
would spend the rest of his professional career working for the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann%20Arbor%20Public%20Schools">Ann
Arbor Public Schools</a>. He worked first as an elementary school teacher
and later as an administrator, at different times serving as Deputy
Superintendent and principal of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Thurston_Elementary_School">Thurston</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Burns_Park_Elementary_School">Burns Park</a> elementary
schools. An early advocate of equal opportunity for all students, he
spent a year with the Mott Foundation in Flint, after which he obtained
his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1969. After retiring from
Burns Park in 1988, he continued to work for the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Administrators_Association">Ann Arbor
Administrators Association</a> until earlier this year. He also served on
the board of the Pinckey Community Schools Alumni Association, chairing
the scholarship committee. He chose the perfect profession as it
allowed him to express his lifelong passion for teaching and learning.
In 1988 the Michigan State Senate passed a concurrent resolution (No.
672) offering tribute to honor David&#39;s contributions to public
education. Along with his family, his other great loves were music,
literature and the arts. Possessing an uncanny ability to remember the
lyrics to any song he was unbeatable at &quot;Name that Tune&quot;. His love of
words was reflected in his unique writings, his large collection of
books and his ability to quote from almost any poem, book or movie.
David was never a stranger in any group - if he met you, he was your
friend. He is survived by his two sons, David Hall Aberdeen of San
Francisco California, and John Stuart Aberdeen of Arlington
Massachusetts, and a host of friends, colleagues and former students. A
memorial will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday, October 3rd, in the Ballroom
of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_League">Michigan League</a>, 911 N. University Avenue in Ann Arbor. David
was a lifelong advocate of public education and to honor him donations
in his memory may be made to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/AAPSEF">Ann Arbor Public Schools Educational
Foundation</a> (<a href="http://aapsef.org/">http://aapsef.org/</a>)

      </h3>
      <p>The basic idea is from Martha Rose &quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&quot; 1986, p. 103.&#0160; It&#39;s very simple, as befits her normal cooking.&#0160; Cut the tops from peppers, clean them out, fill with a mix of leftover rice and beans and top with cheese.&#0160; Bake 30 to 40 minutes, as long as it takes for things to get as soft as you want.</p><p>I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll end up using black beans; there&#39;s rice from yesterday.&#0160; We have an abundance of tomatoes from market, since it&#39;s the season when you order a half a peck they are SO HAPPY that someone wants their roma tomatoes in quantity that you end up with an extra pint of cherry tomatoes just to taste.&#0160; The 4 y/o will want the beans plain.</p><p>Cook all the peppers in the fridge, there will be more on Saturday. The freeze watch line is as far south as Gaylord, so we should be good for a few more weeks.<br /><p class="asset asset-image"><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Frz_plt-Sep-28" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b image-full " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-800wi" title="Frz_plt-Sep-28" /></a>
