<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards.</p>
<p>I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month.
</p>

<p><blockquote>I am responding to your request under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act received November 6, 2012 for a copy of monthly logs of confiscated signs for 2012. Your request is granted.  The number of confiscated signs for the 2012 year to date is 285.  The number if signs collected each month of this year is as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>January - 37 <br />February - 41 <br />March - 23 <br />April - 55 <br />May - 65 <br />June - 82 <br />July - 63 <br />August - 114 <br />September - 34 <br />October - 206 <br />November to date - 105</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s certainly a followup request that tries to go deeper into detail for each of these sign confiscations, but what I thought was interesting was the definite connection between the political season and the number of signs taken down.</p></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wcbn.org" target="_self">WCBN</a> is an amazing student-run radio station at the University of Michigan, founded in 1972 and broadcasting from the basement of the Student Activities Building. Listen live to WCBN at 88.3 FM (all the way to the left on your dial) or <a href="http://www.wcbn.org/listen.html" target="_self">online</a>. You might need to go online to enjoy it if you live outside the transmission area - this map from the FCC shows an approximate radius of where the station can best be enjoyed, though I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve heard it from further away.</p>

The latest information that I have is that the bridge will open at 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but that there will be intermittent lane closures for the rest of the week to finish up the job. City engineer Mike Nearing emailed me to say that &quot;at least one sidewalk will be open while our contractor works to clean and finish the work on the roadway and bridges.&quot;</p>

<p>Our neighborhood had a block party to celebrate the end of construction last weekend, and AnnArbor.com was on it. Distinguished visitors included Rep. <a href="http://arborwiki.org/John_Dingell" target="_self">John Dingell</a> and Mayor <a href="http://arborwiki.org/John_Hieftje" target="_self">John Hieftje</a>, plus a host of neighborhood kids (my boys included) who ran, scootered, and bicycled on the brand new structure.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll all be glad that the detours that made our west side neighbors seem like they were far, far away will be gone, and as an added surprise bonus the bridge will be ready for the final football game vs. Iowa.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A Death Cafe is a safe place where people get together to talk about death and have tea and delicious cake. The idea originated in Switzerland as the &quot;cafe mortel&quot;, is organized from the UK, and has spread to France, Australia and the US. Events are low key, held in public places, and are safe and informal.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Death Cafe is the first of these events to be held in Michigan. It is hosted by Merilynne Rush, who is a retired nurse and home birth midwife and who has been active locally in at home death care and natural burials since 2008. I talked to her today about it and she said that people &quot;don&#39;t have enough chance to talk about death in their life.&quot;</p>
<p>The first meeting of the group is at Eastern Accents on Saturday, November 17, 2012 from 10:00 a.m. to noon. Subsequent meetings are on the third Saturday of each month, except for the December meetup which is on December 8. There is no fee for attending, but please RSVP to Merilynne at <strong>msh.rush@gmail.com</strong>&#0160;so that she and the restaurant can make plans.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://pinterest.com/vielmetti/maps/" target="_self">My Pinterest feed is all maps, all the time</a>. It&#39;s like I discovered rec.arts.maps and jumped right in.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t try to make Pinterest a simple copy of anything else that I do online, in part because there&#39;s really nothing similar to it to copy. It&#39;s ridiculously easy to make a copy of an image and attach a few words to it, and there&#39;s not any real problem with posting too much stuff to it because when you&#39;re on topic it all just flows down the page nicely.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to collect a few people on Pinterest who share my love of maps, and it&#39;s nice to see their map-collecting work in my feed there. What I miss, though, is bringing that love of maps back here - there&#39;s certainly a story behind most of those maps, and perhaps one in ten deserves a longer essay to go with it and some spot in my own permanent blog collection.</p>
<p>The biggest weird thing about Pinterest is how readily people make copies of copyrighted materials. It&#39;s like the rules are different there - fair use, perhaps? - and within the system no one seems to care very much if an image is copyrighted or creative commons or public domain. I&#39;m sure that speeds up the user interface a lot, but it makes me think twice before just yanking anything from within Pinterest and placing it somewhere else without doing some research.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s one of the many maps that I have found that I wouldn&#39;t have collected any other way - I&#39;ve done the Pinterest &quot;embed&quot; here, just to simplify what would otherwise be a multi-step upload and include process. The only complaint with the map is that &quot;Wal-Mart Fans&quot; should probably be &quot;Trader Joes Fans&quot;.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective?</p>
<p>One suggestion, from long-time blogger <a href="http://prentissriddle.com/" target="_self">Prentiss Riddle</a>, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks. You can then push out whatever you want to write wherever and whenever you desire, and still own the original content in a place that you can control.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-manning/2/b58/469" target="_self">Bill Manning</a> suggests <a href="http://streamified.com/" target="_self">Streamified</a>, which is an aggregator that pulls together a variety of inbound streams and presents them attractively. &quot;Add all of your&#0160;<a href="http://streamified.com/#social_streams">social streams</a>&#0160;and watch them all come together in one place.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://about.me/ryanburns" target="_self">Ryan Burns</a> suggests <a href="http://bufferapp.com/" target="_self">Buffer</a> (bufferapp), which lets you write once and then push out those posts to multiple places. &quot;Easily add great articles, pictures and videos to your Buffer and we automagically share them for you through the day!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/juliewbee" target="_self">Julie Weatherbee</a> notes (quite correctly) that simply replicating the same text in Twitter and Facebook is folly, because it doesn&#39;t play to the strengths of either medium. Twitter&#39;s @ references and # hashtags look foolish in a Facebook status, and if you have someone following you on both systems, they&#39;ll find the duplicate efforts irritating. Twitter&#39;s rapid fire, real time updates can overwhelm a Facebook feed easily.</p>
<p>The real challenge, though, is in designing for the writing style. The enforced 140 character limit of Twitter forces you to be pithy, but it also gets in the way of writing coherent sentences and paragraphs. Perhaps, as I have tried to do here, I can repurpose the original Twitter posting and use it as the lead paragraph of a longer essay that lives on Typepad and is excerpted for a Facebook post. As a writing design that&#39;s a hard constraint, but as usual, the discipline of constraints lends itself to better writing if you can pull it off.</p>

      <p>The hash tag #<a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23Indyboom&amp;src=hash" target="_self">indyboom</a> is being used to track what is presumed to be a large gas explosion in the Richmond Hill subdivision in Indianapolis that completely destroyed two homes and caused several others to catch fire. I&#39;m writing this while the incident is still being sorted out, in the hopes of collecting together relevant references and links. This was last updated at 11:07 a.m. on Sunday, November 11, 2012.</p>
<p>Two are dead, according to confirmed reports, and four people had minor injuries that required hospitalization. About 200 people were evacuated from the neighborhood where the blast occurred.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tVwFhJpyikk" width="560"></iframe>
<p>At the original inception of the hash tag, it was unclear whether the event was an earthquake, a plane crash, or something else; it&#39;s been confirmed that there was no plane crash. The explosion was heard for miles around.</p>
<p>The best way I&#39;ve found to follow the incident has been through Radio Reference&#39;s feed of the <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?action=wp&amp;feedId=4336" target="_self">Marion County MECA Fire and Rescue</a>, and via the WISH-8 live TV feed.</p>
<p>Mary Bryan Elementary School, which is nearby, is being used as a place of shelter for residents who are evacuated from the neighborhood. Residents of the area who wish to contribute to relief efforts are asked to coordinate their efforts with their local fire station rather than go directly to the site.</p>
<p>Photos of the event include this <a href="http://instagram.com/p/R4KaVrvmWq/" target="_self">instagram from @indysi94</a>. I&#39;m searching for original credits for the photo before posting it here.</p>

<p>Callers into the WISH-TV newsroom say they heard and felt the explosion from areas around Indianapolis. One caller felt the explosion from Hancock County.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Writing this up to support a bug report, please excuse the technical intrusion.</p>
<p>When I use the blockquote function in the Typepad editor, there&#39;s a sequence of steps that causes me to lose text out of the editor.</p>
<p>A series of screen captures follows. The general pattern runs like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>create three paragraphs</li>
<li>select the second paragraph, and blockquote it; the third paragraph blockquotes as well</li>
<li>switch to HTML view to confirm that the blockquote includes two paragraphs</li>
<li>switch back to rich text</li>
<li>reselect the second paragraph, and unblockquote it; nothing seems to happen</li>
<li>switch to HTML view; the second and third paragraphs are not there</li>
<li>reswitch to rich text, the second and third paragraphs disappear</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m using Chrome 21 on MacOS 10.5.8; the same problem happens on Safari on the same machine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c332aedd6970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="I-think-i-voted-sticker-tn" /></a>I think I voted today.</p>
<p>I used the <strong>Automark</strong> machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&#39;ve used this machine before <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error.html" target="_self">many times</a>, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator.</p>
<p>The actual practice of voting went fine. It&#39;s a long ballot, and I went through all of the eleections, in some cases undervoting the ballot (see &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/10/bullet-voting-or-plunking-as-a-voting-strategy-in-pick-n-elections.html" target="_self">plunking</a>&quot;) and in other cases not voting at all when I didn&#39;t know anything about any of the candidates (my bad).&#0160;</p>
<p>The touch screen on the Automark device that I used didn&#39;t have perfect registration, and so every so often I&#39;d hit a button for one candidate adn it would mark the other one. You&#39;d think that you could design a screen so that the ballot &quot;hot spot&quot; for each candidate was further apart, don&#39;t you think? But I was careful and made sure to vote for the right candidate each time.</p>
<p>The first problem occurred as the ballot was being printed. The printer went kachunka-chunka and printed both sides of the ballot, but then it stopped with an error message to call an election official. The very nice election officials didn&#39;t know any more about the error message than I did, so we decided to pull the machine apart to extract the printed ballot, and if it turned out to be wrong to spoil it and start over. It came out OK, I double checked it and it was printed on both sides, so it looked right.</p>
<p>Next, time to insert it into the tabulator. Usually you insert the ballot into the tabulator from the top, right? But the tabulator wouldn&#39;t take the ballot. I then put it in backwards, and the machine accepted it. I just hope that it read it correctly.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t a confidence-inspiring visit to the polling place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Long Island Power Authority has not one but three maps showing power outages and restorations. I&#39;m not sure which is most informative. Each of these are from the evening of Saturday, November 3, 2012. Please click through to the page linked for current updates.</p>
<p>Some news that goes along with this:</p>
<p>Newsday, Tuesday November 6: &quot;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cuomo-blasts-delays-in-power-restoration-as-unacceptable-1.4191546" target="_self">Cuomo blasts delays in power restoration as &#39;unacceptable&#39;</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criticism of LIPA&#39;s outage map prompted the utility to produce a new format.</p>
<p>It came under intense heat and skepticism Monday after ratepayers noticed outages in their area were reported to be considerably smaller than they knew to be the case.</p>
<p>Hervey said LIPA sharply cut back the touted capability of the map to remove most interactivity, including restoration times in specific neighborhoods, and other details of outages, because the features weren&#39;t working.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>As he did last week, Cuomo expressed anger at utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;The progress is unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that the utility companies have not performed adequately. The utilities are paid to provide service. They should have been prepared.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LIPA chief operating officer <strong>Michael Hervey</strong> on Sunday acknowledged a large backlog in uploading current information to the outage system. Crews are focused on work, he said, but LIPA is working harder to get the information current and accurate.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not enough for Pat Davis, who was forced to evacuate her&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;home because the family could not remain there with their 1-year-old as temperatures dropped below 50 degrees. She said the outage map shows only 1,000 outages in the neighborhood, but &quot;I do not know anybody south of&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Merrick,_NY">Merrick</a>&#0160;Road with power, as well as many north of Merrick Road without power.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/powerless-lipa-customers-frustrated-suspicious-of-numbers-1.4188048" target="_self">Newsday, Monday November 5:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LIPA was reporting that 263,000 customers remained without power as of Monday morning, down from the high of 945,000 a week ago. The number excludes around 30,000 customers in the Rockaway Peninsula,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Beach,_NY">Long Beach</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Atlantic_Beach,_NY">Atlantic Beach</a>, and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Fire_Island,_NY">Fire Island</a>&#0160;whose homes were so badly damaged they cannot take electric service.</p>
<p>The outage map, a critical link to many customers seeking information on their anticipated restoration time, has taken a skewering since the storm began. First it reported thousands more outages than some hamlets or villages had actual LIPA customers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On day five of the largest outage in&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Long_Island,_NY">Long Island</a>&#0160;history, LIPA received unprecedented levels of reinforcements -- 900 line workers from&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Canada">Canada</a>, Florida and&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Arizona">Arizona</a>, some airlifted here with their equipment, according to Hervey. The flights were arranged by Gov. Andrew M.&#0160;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/topics//Andrew_Cuomo">Cuomo</a>&#0160;working with federal officials. The total workforce is now well over 3,100 workers.</p>
<p>LIPA spokesman Mark Gross said the number of workers in the field would be 4,300 by this morning, with another 1,000 being added by day&#39;s end, which would be more workers than any prior LIPA restoration effort.</p>

<p>This dramatic map shows areas where power is out (in red), where it has been restored (in blue), and where there was never a service interruption (in grey). It&#39;s from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LIPAnews" target="_self">LIPAnews Facebook page</a> and from the <a href="http://www.lipower.org/stormcenter/map-update.html" target="_self">LIPA Storm Center</a>&#0160;map update from Saturday, November 3:</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Sandy hit the US East Coast earlier this week, knocking out power to more than 8 million subscribers. The damage to the infrastructure was so severe that it&#39;s expected to take more than a week to bring service back.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.</p>
<p><strong>NY Times</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/30/nyregion/new-york-power-outages.html" target="_self">tracking power outages and restoration for the Con Edison service</a>. They&#39;re pulling county by county data from the utility company web site and tracking and visualizing it over time. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/31/nyregion/where-the-power-is-out-and-returning.html" target="_self">More detailed reporting also covers surrounding states</a>, including hard-hit New Jersey and Long Island. Sample graphic:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 57" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c3306cb07970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 57" /></a><br /><strong>Con Edison Charts</strong></p>
<p>Another tracker for Con Edison outage information has been done by Cameron Cundiff (@<a href="http://twitter.com/ckundo" target="_self">ckundo</a>) from Pivotal Labs. This one features <a href="https://github.com/ckundo/coned_charts" target="_self">source code on Github</a>&#0160;and a chart on <a href="http://stormpox.com/" target="_self">stormpox.com</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 59" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017d3d35640c970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 59" /></a><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>iFactor’s Storm Center</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Storm Center&quot; application from iFactor powers the web sites for a number of the larger utilities affected by Hurricane Sandy. In&#0160;<a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com/storm-center-put-to-the-test-during-sandy/">Storm Center put to the test during Sandy</a>, they discuss how the systems held up in the storm. Some&#0160;3,500,000 visits were logged to the mapping pages, and of those 20-50% were from mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>NYC Power Status</strong></p>
<p>Does NYC have power? A simple page shows current restoration status by borough. &quot;Con Edison is working on it.&quot; See <a href="http://www.nycpowerstatus.com" target="_self">nycpowerstatus.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The trouble with utility outage tracking</strong></p>
<p>The hardest part about tracking utility outages across a broad area is that there&#39;s wide variety in how each utility reports outages. It would be useful to a lot of organizations to have a single map covering the whole storm area, but instead we have little pieces of a big picture.</p>

      <p>My twitter feed is blowing up with people discussing Hurricane Sandy and its likely impact on the East Coast. In the interests of having somewhere useful to drop things that come up along the way, here&#39;s a live blog of sorts of the event. I&#39;ll put all of my Sandy stuff here, rather than have it go over multiple other entries. The top of this is collected info; the bottom is the blog collecting things without much sorting except chronological. Whenever possible, I&#39;ll point to things that work well on mobile phones where screen size and bandwidth are an issue.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage map collection</a> is a good point of reference. It&#39;s organized by state, with phone numbers and twitter feeds for utility company news and information. It loads relatively slowly because of all of the graphics, so you&#39;ll want to bookmark your utility&#39;s pages and save their phone number before the storm hits.</p>
<p>On Twitter, I&#39;m following a list @<a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/poweroutage" target="_self">vielmetti/poweroutage</a> with about 40 utility company feeds all in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Weather maps and forecasts</strong></p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m at Lou Rosenfeld&#39;s talk at the Michigan Union, with the title &quot;Beyond user research: Building an organizational brain&quot;. Notes below.</p>
<p>&#0160;&quot;You are not your user.&quot; The importance of talking to your users. The book &quot;Design of Everyday Things&quot;, 1986 as a watershed event. Everyone understands this now, so &quot;we won&quot;. But what does victory look like?</p>
<p>&#0160;Less of an information architect, more of an information therapist.</p>
<p>Reports from the user research group; information about site search analytics (in another group); logs from the call center (yet another group); reports from web analytics applications (yet another group); also &quot;Voice of the Customer&quot; (survey research); CRM applications like Salesforce; papers from a research center; papers from the net; a &quot;mental model&quot; diagram; brand architecture research; net promoter score (survey research).</p>
<p>The problem: where&#39;s the insight in a situation that&#39;s completely siloed. Risk to &quot;user research&quot; work is that it&#39;s siloed away. If you collaborate you&#39;re &quot;the brain for the organization&quot;.</p>
<p>1. What vs. why.&#0160;</p>
<p>2. Quantitative vs qualitiative.</p>
<p>3. Organizational goals vs user goals.</p>
<p>4. Measure what you know vs. explore what you don&#39;t know. (Look for outliers, surprises, patterns.)</p>
<p>5. Statistical data vs. descriptive data.</p>
<p>How to succeed in getting user research to cooperate? Use data from other siloes. Examples: site search data from search logs; match persona with search log analysis; use analytics tools to frame questions about user behavior; field study + analytics combined.&#0160;</p>
<p>Example: query search for &quot;lost&quot; on Netflix.</p>
<p>How to get out of your silo: get out of your (physical) space; eat in the other cafeteria.</p>

      <p><p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/24/weather-journal-storm-could-make-next-week-a-mess/" target="_self">Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.</p>

<p>The Twitter hashtag is #<a href="http://twitter.com/#snoreastercane" target="_self">snoreastercane</a> and is in use already, with comments like this from @LoriG: &quot;Unexpected consequence of global warming: having to learn the names of a bunch of new types of storms&quot;. Most of the storm traffic is on #<a href="http://twitter.com/#sandy" target="_self">sandy</a>. </p>
<p>The other name for the storm is &quot;Frankenstorm&quot;, from the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd&amp;version=0&amp;fmt=reg" target="_self">Hydrometeorological Prediction Center</a>&#0160;extended forecast for Thursday, October 25, 2012:</p>
<blockquote>THE HIGH DEGREE OF BLOCKING FROM EASTERN NORTH AMERICA ACROSS THE
ENTIRE ATLANTIC BASIN IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW THIS UNUSUAL MERGER TO
TAKE PLACE, AND ONCE THE COMBINED GYRE MATERIALIZES, IT SHOULD
SETTLE BACK TOWARD THE INTERIOR NORTHEAST THROUGH HALLOWEEN,

<p><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2272" target="_self">Sandy: a potential billion-dollar storm for the mid-Atlantic, New England, and Canada<br /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] These models are predicting that Sandy will get caught up by the trough approaching the Eastern U.S., which will inject a large amount of energy into the storm, converting it to a powerful subtropical storm with a central pressure below 960 mb and sustained winds of 60 - 70 mph. Winds of this strength would likely cause massive power outages, as trees still in leaf take out power lines. Also of great concern are Sandy&#39;s rains. Given that ocean temperatures along the Northeast U.S. coast are about&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at">5°F above average</a>, there will be an unusually large amount of water vapor available to make heavy rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy is now a category 1 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and central pressure of 970 hPa (see picture).&#0160; My community is all aflutter about this storm, particularly since our forecast models are&#0160;<strong>not&#0160;</strong>in agreement&ndash;some suggest the storm will intensify and head straight in to the Middle Atlantic coastline, some take it out to sea, and others move it out to sea before swinging it westward to hit New England or the Canadian maritimes.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?</p>
<p>I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;<a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-October/date.html" target="_self">outages</a>&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. One report of call failures listed the following cities:</p>
<pre>Cedar Rapids
Springfield, IL
Madison, WI
Green Bay, WI
Minneapolis
Sioux Falls
Omaha
Des Moines
Dubuque
Fargo
St. Louis
Davenport
Kansas City
Detroit
</pre>
<p>as affected.</p>

<p>This page is getting a lot of traffic for the outage; here&#39;s a map showing where some of that traffic is coming from, which approximates the boundaries of the issue.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.</p>
<p>2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</p>
<p>3. Cast 4 votes, leaving none behind, and choosing one of the candidates you are opposed to to round out the ballot.</p>
<p>The strategy is called &quot;bullet voting&quot;, and it has some pros and cons which are neatly spelled out in this <a href="http://larrydavidson.blogspot.com/2005/09/bullet-voting-pro-and-con.html" target="_self">2005 blog post from Larry Davidson</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, to bullet-vote or not? The choice depends entirely on which scenario you think is more probable. If the race for fourth place is between your two favorite candidates, you should bullet-vote. If the race for fourth place is between your second choice and someone you strongly dislike, you should not bullet-vote. Maybe it’s not how they would handle it on&#0160;<em>Numb3rs,&#0160;</em>but math can’t give you a definite answer here.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullet voting is also known as &quot;plunking&quot;. The general case of voting systems being gamed by strategic voters is more common than you&#39;d expect, since it can give a coordinated minority the ability to decide an election over a disorganized majority.</p>
