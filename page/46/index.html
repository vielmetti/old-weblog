<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><strong>David E. Davis, Jr.</strong> (b.&#0160;November 7, 1930,&#0160;Burnside, Kentucky; d.&#0160;March 27, 2011, Ann Arbor, Michigan) was the founder of&#0160;<em>Automobile Magazine</em>&#0160;and a long time&#0160;<em>Car and Driver</em>&#0160;editor. His distinctive voice defined modern automotive journalism. He is survived by a&#0160;wife, Jeannie, a daughter, and two sons, many friends, and a generation of automotive writers and car lovers. Services are pending.</p>
<p><strong>Memorials:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://rumors.automobilemag.com/automobile-magazine-founder-david-davis-jr-dies-80-36613.html" target="_self">Automobile Magazine</a></strong>: Davis was a lifelong car enthusiast&#0160;who worked in all corners of the industry, from racing to advertising to editorial and publishing. He was well-regarded in the industry for the profound impact his work had on many modern car journalists, not to mention readers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Eddie Alterman for <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/david-e-davis-jr-1930%E2%80%932011/" target="_self">Car and Driver</a>:&#0160;He was a champion of the automotive good life, and he lived it right to the very end.

      </h3>
      <p><p><strong>Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Frost</strong> (1952 - March 2011) was a professor at the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu" target="_self">University of Michigan School of Information</a>. He&#0160;received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983 and joined the University of Michigan faculty in 2000. Frost was the great-grandson of poet <a href="http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu/misc/poet.html" target="_self">Robert Frost</a>, and established the&#0160;<a href="http://www.umich.info/about-SI/news-detail.htm?NewsItemID=571" target="_self">Frost Open Access Fund</a>&#0160;with royalties from his great-grandfather&#39;s works to&#0160;support faculty and student projects related to open access to information. He is survived by his wife&#0160;Margaret Hedstrom; relations, colleagues, current and former students and many friends. Donations may go to the American Cancer Society via <a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost" target="_self">Team Frost</a>. Additional details are pending.</p>
<p>There will be a memorial service for Bob Frost held on <strong>Friday, April 15 at 3:00 p.m.</strong> at the Michigan Union Ballroom in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Frost was interviewed for Michigan Today in Winter of 1996, in a story published under the title <a href="http://michigantoday.umich.edu/96/Win96/mta4w96.html" target="_self">Robert Frost&#39;s great-grandson is not a big fan of the poetry</a>.</p>
<p>A number of Bob&#39;s friends, colleagues and students have written in memoriam, collected in small part here.</p>
<p>Mark Matienzo: <a href="http://thesecretmirror.com/blog/2011/03/27/in-memoriam-bob-frost/" target="_self">In memoriam</a>. &quot;Most importantly, he was a faculty member in a huge and ever-growing graduate program who seemed to enjoy nearly every interaction he had with a student, and encouraged us to reach out to him to send him links to &quot;cool stuff&quot; on the Web that might interest him.&quot;</p>
<p>University of Michigan School of Information Dean Jeffrey Mackie-Mason announced his death with this message, which was circulated widely and is reproduced here.</p>
<blockquote>Date: Sat, Mar 26, 2011 at 11:49 PM</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dear friends, students, colleagues</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is with deep personal sadness that I write to tell you that Bob Frost has passed away. He expired while resting at home, with his wife &ndash; our colleague Margaret Hedstrom &ndash; and family members by his side. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>As many of you know, because Bob was a delightfully transparent and honest person, he has been fighting cancer for nearly two-and-a-half years. &#0160;He had remarkable courage, and fortitude (the initial prognosis was that he had less than a year to live). Bob was passionate about teaching, about his students, and about our School. &#0160;He insisted on continuing to teach a full load, and even developed new courses during his illness. &#0160;Remarkably, he was still in the classroom teaching SI 500 less than three weeks ago. &#0160;Many generations of undergraduate and graduate students have been touched by Bob; many of them say that he had a transformative impact on their choice of major and career. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was born in 1952, and received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983. He came to Michigan as a visiting associate professor of history in 1995, and joined the SI faculty in 2000. For more information about his many publications, his teaching and his other interests, see&#0160;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/</a></a>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was passionate about many things, including a passion for sharing information for the good of all. &#0160;Bob and Margaret established the Frost Open Access Fund by donating the royalties that Bob receives from the works of his great-grandfather, poet Robert Frost. &#0160;The fund was also named to honor Bob&#39;s friend and colleague Olivia Frost, SI&#39;s former interim dean and professor emerita. &#0160;The Frost Fund supports innovative projects that utilize open source software, or that study or promote the open access movement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have known Bob since shortly after he arrived in Ann Arbor, and over the years was proud to become his friend. &#0160;His death is a great loss to me, and I know it is to many of you as well; I share my sympathy with all of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A number of activities are planned to help us address our grief, and to remember Bob. &#0160;One is a fundraiser for cancer research that his students started a week ago in honor of Bob&#39;s battle: if you wish, you may contribute through the American Cancer Society at&#0160;<a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost" target="_blank"><a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost">http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost</a></a>. &#0160;We will announce details of other activities soon. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>For now, please join me in a moment of silent reflection in Bob&#39;s honor. &#0160;And please join me in extending support and sympathy to Bob&#39;s loving wife, and our friend and colleague, Margaret Hedstrom.</blockquote>

<p>Car 49 &quot;The Parkers&quot;, engineered by a Ford Motor Company marketing employee and driven by his son, a student at Ann Arbor Christian School, won the third annual Ann Arbor Box Car Derby. The derby, sponsored by Ann Arbor Active Against ALS and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, raised an estimated $4,000 today to help families affected by ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. The winning vehicle was designed and built in less than a week from engineered cellulose biomaterials and recycled automotive marketing materials.</p>

<p>Look here for a list of all the cars that are racing; I&#39;ll look for the bracket.</p>
<p>1:21 p.m. We&#39;re in the final single elimination round. Photog from AnnArbor.com should have lots of photos up on Flickr tonight. I think I found the ESPN8 stringer.</p>
<p><strong>11 a.m.</strong> Race is three heats (all cars compete), then single elimination. The really good teams have a good strong pusher, who gives them a straight run down the street. Steering is essential. Media here: CTN Ann Arbor, Heritage Newspapers. No sign of AnnArbor.com, ESPN. Lots of photographers here.</p>

<p><strong>Obituary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lamb, Robert Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot;, &quot;Ffej&quot;, &quot;Honey Bunny&quot;</strong></p>
<p>January 16, 1949 - March 22, 2011</p>
<p>Jeff was born in Oberlin, Ohio, and shortly afterward his family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He attended public schools in Ann Arbor and earned a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the University of Michigan. In 1978, Jeff moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, a city he loved dearly until the day he died. It was there that he met his loving wife, Leyla, who was visiting New Orleans from Hannover, Germany. Jeff and Leyla were married in Ann Arbor in 1986 and lived there happily until his death.</p>
<p>Jeff was a professional photographer whose extraordinary photographs of New Orleans, Detroit, Ann Arbor and the Leelanau Peninsula will stand the test of time. He showed his love for New Orleans by documenting the architecture of the city and worked closely with the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. After Jeff moved back to Ann Arbor, he continued his photography career and established many professional contacts throughout the world. His work has been influential, especially after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and destroyed many of the homes of which Jeff had taken photographs. He established deep connections with other photographers in New Orleans and made many close friends there through Facebook.&#0160;Jeff also photographed historic homes in Ann Arbor and was instrumental in trying to save the Ann Arbor Seven.</p>
<p>Jeff was preceded in death by his parents, Jane and Robert Lamb; and sister, Susan. He is survived by his wife, Leyla Lau-Lamb; his dog, Sonny; a cousin, David (Susan) Emmett of Howell, Michigan; nephew, Bryan Emmett (Shawnee); niece, Kelin Emmett; and many friends around the world who miss him terribly. He was one of a kind. There will be a celebration of Jeff&#39;s life at Hathaway&#39;s Hideaway, 310 S. Ashley, Ann Arbor, on April 9th beginning at 4:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Jeff&#39;s name to The Advocacy Department of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans, 923 Tchoupitoulas St., New Orleans, LA 70130.</p>

Here&#39;s this week&#39;s event calendar, mostly for events in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan. Note that it doesn&#39;t include every possible thing going on, just what people tell me about, and what is interesting enough for me to notice and plan ahead for. I&#39;ll be at some of these, I hope.</p>
<p>If you have an event to share, leave it as a comment on this post. Some events are intentionally left incomplete, so that I can publish in haste and edit at leisure.</p>
<p><strong>Thu 3/24</strong>: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/a2b3" target="_self">a2b3</a> lunch at <strong>Eastern Accents</strong>, 214 S. Fourth Ave, Ann Arbor. Buy your own lunch (light Asian meals, $5-$10). People start showing up 11:30 a.m. or so, introductions at 12:30pm, then discussion of events (this list) and jobs.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-03-23-huron-river-waterwatch/">Huron River water level watching: USGS National Water Information System</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Follow the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=04174500" target="_self">level of the Huron River as it goes through Ann Arbor</a>&#0160;with the USGS National Water Information System. On March 23, the river is rising, but it&#39;s also fluctuating in levels, enough that it&#39;s difficult to determine whether current trends would lead you to believe that there is any risk of flooding.</p>
<p><a href="http://137.227.241.67/nwisweb/data/img/USGS.04174500.02.00065..20110316.20110323..0..gif"><img alt="image from 137.227.241.67" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="image from 137.227.241.67" /></a>If you were to watch this closely, what would you watch?</p>
<p>The USGS will give you an alert if the level of the river is above or below a certain level.</p>
<p>The first derivative is the rate of change of the water level. You&#39;d want to track that to note trends. If you measured the difference between adjacent water levels, you&#39;d identify spikes, which have been associated with work on the dam in the past; those will give you a metric on the order of rate of change in inches per hour. If you did some smoothing, you&#39;d find trending measured in feet per day.</p>
<p>The second derivative is the rate of the rate of change of the water level; you&#39;re looking for that to identify erratic behavior. As a rule of thumb a time series with large movements in both directions (up and down) over a short amount of time is a sign of river disturbance.</p>
<p>A plausible approach would be to compute a smoothed curve, and then alert on deviations from the smoothed curve. You&#39;d love to be able to tell the difference between sudden downpour, steady rain, flash flood, work on the dam, and dam failure.</p>
<p>Another strip chart to line up with this is rainfail (measured in convenient units) and precipitation forecast.</p>
<p>This forecast is from <a href="http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/new/index.php?m=real&amp;r=mi&amp;w=map" target="_self">USGS Waterwatch for Michigan</a>. Hidden behind the projected water level is a rainfall forecast for the watershed.</p>
<p><a href="http://water.weather.gov/resources/hydrographs/annm4_hg.png"><img alt="image from water.weather.gov" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a7eb8970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a7eb8970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="image from water.weather.gov" /></a></p>
