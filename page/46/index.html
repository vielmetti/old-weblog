<h2 id="things-yet-to-do-in-this-weblog-setup:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Things yet to do in this weblog setup:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs etc</li>
</ul>

Then it was a full blown society, full of interesting people who happened to express their interestingness through photography. Digital photography was new then, and special, and there was some first flush of enthusiasm for having a system that &quot;got it&quot;.</p>
<p>Time and space happened, and Flickr became part of Yahoo. A piece of the fun drained out, and the Internet got bigger. Digital photography got more ordinary, and the camera I carry around everywhere felt more and more like a crappy camera and not like something I could capture the essence of the world with.</p>
<p>I&#39;m at a point where I could easily take a photograph every day and send it somewhere. Should Flickr be that place? Will the time come not too soon when I will want to be a refugee from it, downloading my photos in the hopes that I can re-upload them somewhere else, tags and annotations intact and some fragment of society reconstructed around them?</p>
<p>I loved Flickr once, in the way that I&#39;m sure that people once loved Compuserve. There is still a Game Neverending to play with photographs, but I don&#39;t know yet where to play that game.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>For future reference, since I end up immediately thinking of Veblen when I read about <a href="http://www.sippey.com/2010/12/scharffenberger-tofu.html" target="_self">artisanal tofu</a>. This from Theory of the Leisure Class is on hand-made goods (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place assigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point of material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought goods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former serve their primary purpose more adequately. They are a more perfect product—show a more perfect adaptation of means to end. This does not save them from disesteem and deprecation, for they fall short under the test of honorific waste. <em>Hand labor is a more wasteful method of production; hence the goods turned out by this method are more serviceable for the purpose of pecuniary reputability; hence the marks of hand labor come to be honorific, and the goods which exhibit these marks take rank as of higher grade than the corresponding machine product. </em>Commonly, if not invariably, the honorific marks of hand labor are certain imperfections and irregularities in the lines of the hand-wrought article, showing where the workman has fallen short in the execution of the design. The ground of the superiority of hand-wrought goods, therefore, is a certain margin of crudeness. This margin must never be so wide as to show bungling workmanship, since that would be evidence of low cost, nor so narrow as to suggest the ideal precision attained only by the machine, for that would be evidence of low cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/833/833-h/833-h.htm" target="_self">Gutenberg edition of Theory of the Leisure Class</a>&#0160;is a convenient edition, since it&#39;s all on one page; it also has those honorific marks of hand labor, including exhortations at the end to give the reader &quot;Plain Vanilla ASCII&quot; upon request.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, of course, the details of the relationship between man and machine also change. Goods produced on an old machine, ideally one for which parts cannot be obtained except by manufacturing them yourself, obtain the high status of handmade goods. The more obscure the equipment, the better, and imperfections in old equipment provide the same &quot;honorific marks&quot; of handmade goods.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup.</p>
<p>The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere.</p>
<p>The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food.</p>
<p>What I was really after, and what I found readily (since 34 people have bookmarked it on pinboard) was Malcolm Gladwell's 2004 <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_09_06_a_ketchup.html" target="_self">The Ketchup Conundrum</a>. After finding that, I readily found Meg Favreau's <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article07290902.aspx" target="_self">Playing Ketchup</a>&nbsp;and Johan Lehrer's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/08/ketchup.php" target="_self">Ketchup</a> from The Frontal Cortex.</p>
<p>As for recipes (other than "buy a bottle of Heinz"), try</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/jamie-oliver/homemade-tomato-ketchup-recipe/index.html" target="_self">Jamie Oliver's homemade ketchup</a></li>
<li>(your suggestion goes here)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my search strategies in finding things that I had previously known about is to search for them with my name attached, e.g. a search for "vielmetti ketchup". This is less about ego and more about retrieval; you can do the same with your favorite prolific blogger or news source ("kottke ketchup" generates an equally interesting set).</p>
<p>I wonder if you've been getting enough ketchup.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/" target="_self">scuttlebutt</a> is that delicious is going to be <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bpm140/status/15473591558602752" target="_self">axed</a> by Yahoo.&#0160;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.</p>
<p>Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it. Sometimes these were straightforward tags, like the 1533 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/annarbor" target="_self">annarbor</a>&quot;. Others were idiosyncratic, like the 5 pages I marked as &quot;<a href="http://www.delicious.com/vielmetti/attention-to-irrelevant-details" target="_self">attention-to-irrelevant-details</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>There are other, better ways to bookmark things so that lots of people see them. The facebook &quot;like&quot; button gets more page views without consuming any <a href="http://elab.eserver.org/hfl0098.html" target="_self">cognitive overhead</a> about how to tag, whether to tag, and what you&#39;ve tagged before. Actually writing about something is quite a bit better than just bookmarking it, because you get to be yourself for a little while and not just an automaton forwarding on links automatically.</p>
<p>Every bookmark I ever did on delicious, up until now, is archived for posterity here:&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm" target="_self">vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/delicious-20101216.htm</a>&#0160;. As I review it, there really should have been more of them marked &quot;attention to irrelevant details&quot;. It&#39;s hours of reading, though some of it goes by fast because the site that was linked to has disappeared, leaving only the bookmark and whatever clipping I managed to care about.</p>
<p>edit: now with more cognitive overhead</p>
<p>more delicious:</p>

      <p><p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a cheaper way to clean a dishwasher than to put heavily marketed, sugary &ldquo;breakfast drink&rdquo; powder into it. Tang is citric acid and sweetener and artificial flavor that tastes like moon rocks.</p>

<p>The powdered capsicum slightly dusted in the socks of persons subject to cold feet will generally prove a salutary means of overpowering that unpleasant sensation.

      <p>A much-beloved but seedy local landmark will close, with developers planning to build a shiny hi-rise on the location.

      </h3>
      <p>&quot;When you retire,&quot; he says, &quot;you should go offline for a whole year.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea is to sell all of your computers, turn in your cell phone, and generally shun any computer technology. Perhaps you&#39;ll still write, but it will be longhand or on a typewriter. If there&#39;s a phone call to be made, you&#39;ll have to be there to receive it, since there is no answering machine. No Twitter, no Facebook, no blogs. Whatever money you save in computing and telecom costs, you spend on pens and paper and postcards and stamps.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not certain what this word &quot;retire&quot; means, but it&#39;s an appealing idea. For me, it would mean rewinding the technology clock back to the early 1980s.</p>
<p>A piece of the inspiration for this is the late Steve Cisler&#39;s <a href="http://tingilinde.typepad.com/unconnected/" target="_self">unconnected</a> project.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><blockquote>
<p>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece. (This article will be no exception.) But the academic buzz around the subject isn’t just a case of eggheads rationalizing their slothfulness. As various scholars argue in “The Thief of Time,” edited by Chrisoula Andreou and Mark D. White (Oxford; $65)—a collection of essays on procrastination, ranging from the resolutely theoretical to the surprisingly practical—the tendency raises fundamental philosophical and psychological issues.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am reading this while procrastinating.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/03/time_management.html" target="_self">precise instructions to myself</a> in my journal in 1999, repeated in 2004, on how to avoid procrastination, under the guise of &quot;time management&quot;. This presumes, of course, that all you need to do is make a few rational decisions and buck up and buckle down to work, in the ignorance of all other possible motivations.</p>
<p>A challenge in a world of infinite possibilities is that choosing to do anything means you are choosing not to do something else. This brings to mind <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/" target="_self">Jim Benson&#39;s Personal Kanban</a>, which only has two rules at its core:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualize your work</li>
<li>Limit your work in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>A sure cure for procrastination, then, is simply to not do something, rather than putting it off. Alas not all tasks can be discarded so easily.</p></p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://munnecke.com/blog/" target="_self">Tom Munnecke</a> reminds me of a slow conversation we have been having for a few years. &#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/slow_conversati.html" target="_self">I noted it here about five years ago.</a>&#0160;&#0160;Five years is a pretty good time to stretch out a single line of thinking, so it&#39;s worthwhile reflecting on how much current writing structure allows for some amount of leisurely conversation in the face of a daily deadline.</p>
<p>The hard part about taking a question slowly is that <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti" target="_self">most of what I end up writing for AnnArbor.com</a> is done with a short deadline. A daily column gets written the same day, much of the time, and the hours spent reading and following up on comments are as near real time performance art as anything else. How on earth do you have leisurely conversations when there&#39;s always the next thing to do?</p>
<p>The answer, perhaps, is to leave open questions which are unanswered, and don&#39;t try to seal off the end of each piece of writing with a neat and tidy finish. By leaving open ended questions which would take much more time than could be answered inside the scope of the words you have to produce today, you get the hopeful opportunity to revisit that same topic knowing a bit more about what you don&#39;t know when it&#39;s time to look again.</p>
<p>This echoes, in part, one of <a href="http://dangillmor.com/" target="_self">Dan Gillmor</a>&#39;s suggestions for journalism: that readers and writers <a href="http://personaldemocracy.com/blog-entry/using-distributed-media-and-people-ask-hard-questions" target="_self">collect unanswered questions</a> as a part of the process of addressing complicated issues, and that the collected set of questions gets raised not only by the author but also by anyone else who wants to take up the task.</p>
<p>Writing a good question is difficult, and knowing when and where to pose it is a challenge. Some questions are better spoken, and others better written down. If the questions are difficult enough, you might spend most of the time looking to see who will answer them sensibly. &#0160;Yet it may be that only by raising more questions than you are able to answer that you will get forward progress on complicated issues at a pace that doesn&#39;t lend itself to instant answers.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s harvest time, which means there are a lot of recipes you can do with food that you can buy locally. One thing that would help that a lot is finding the people who buy the same stuff you do, and who share the same tastes, and who can work with you to figure out how to stock up so you have enough on your shelves always to get a meal on the table.</p>
<p>The approach that seems best is to come up with a harvest calendar for each kind of produce that you enjoy, and then to use it as a set of filters into which you set in a bunch of recipes.</p>
<p>The end result could be as simple as tuning in to the local markets, figuring out what is exceptionally good quality or good value at the moment, and then getting back a list of recipes that takes advantage of that. For the handful of things that only show up once a year for a short season (quince, paw paws) you want to anticipate that with recipes so that when they do show you are ready to go.</p>

<p>Wikipedia conveniently doesn&#39;t yet include <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics/browse_thread/thread/9d31a64739cb54e3/7e01d8472da63f0?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=retcon" target="_self">this post from rec.arts.comics from Steve Simmons</a>&#0160;in 1989:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear, hear! &#0160;&quot;Crisis On Infinite Earths&quot; solved a DC crisis all right,&#0160;but it wasn&#39;t the problem of having multiple earths. &#0160;It was the problem&#0160;of 50 years of continuity complicating their existing characters. &#0160;DC&#0160;had been either ignoring the continuity (which led to contradiction and&#0160;reader frustration) or attempting to adhere to it, effectively hamstringing&#0160;them (&quot;remember, we solved that one back in &#39;42&quot;). &#0160;&quot;Crisis&quot; let DC have&#0160;good reason to&#0160;<strong>retcon</strong>&#0160;characters to whatever extent needed -- heck, it&#0160;practically demanded it.&#0160;</p>

<p>Implanting false memories can also be useful for the corporate persona, where parts of the corporate origin story get rewritten to suit the current corporate branding. If you don&#39;t have strong documentation for the past - or if no one really cares - you can pull together a selective narrative that picks out the parts of the history that highlight the best parts of the present.&#0160;</p>

      <p>Rankings impose discipline on markets: Wendy&#0160;Espeland&#39;s&#0160;<a href="http://asociologist.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/notes-from-icos-espeland-a-different-kind-of-quantitative-sociology/" target="_self">A Different Kind of Quantitative Sociology</a>&#0160;talk at ICOS in 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third is&#0160;<em>discipline</em>&#0160;(<a href="http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/where-in-the-world-is-michel-foucault/">here comes the Foucault!</a>). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers. Espeland draws here on her recent work on US News and World Report law school rankings. For example, because the rankings counted median LSAT scores of only regular full-time students, law schools began to push weaker applicants into doing part-time and night programs. In response to a proposal by US News to start including those programs in the median LSAT calculations, law schools formed committees to ponder reforming or closing their night and part-time programs. Organizational discipline in action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of the argument has 5 bullet points</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantification takes work</li>
<li>Quantification changes what it measures</li>
<li>Quantification imposes discipline on those who are measured</li>
<li>Numbers are seen as authoritative</li>
<li>Numbers are powerful for their aesthetic qualities</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202444960579&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1" target="_self">National Law Journal takes on the impact</a> of this in May 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>U.S. News</em>&#0160;does maintain a law school &quot;diversity index,&quot; but those data are not a factor in the overall rankings.&#0160;<br /><br />&quot;A lot of people we interviewed expressed concern over the impact of rankings on diversity,&quot; said Wendy Espeland, an assistant professor of sociology at Northwestern University. &quot;The overarching tension between catering to the rankings and doing what you think is best for your school is intense.&quot;&#0160;</p>

<p>Every once in a while I invoke the phrase &quot;quality without a number&quot;; most recently, I guess, in a post on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/reification-is.html" target="_self">Reification is an Ontological Imperative</a>, also from 2008. <a href="http://www.yourdonreport.com/index.php/2008/04/14/detroit-presentation-the-politics-of-metrics/" target="_self">&#0160;Ed Yourdon&#39;s The Politics of Metrics</a> has the same theme.</p>

<p>A look out the window of the Oxford Shuttle, a bus that goes around the University of Michigan central campus.</p>
<p>A reprise of the &quot;top 10 internet cafes&quot; post from 2006, updated with a lot of 2010 details.</p>
<p>10 bed and breakfasts in the area, plus a long list more, all based on first hand research.</p>
<p>Where to watch the Michigan-Notre Dame Game anywhere in the country, with notes on which of the places serve Michigan beers.</p>
<p>Which little place between here and Amherst, Mass. serves a mean Michigan dog, and what exactly do they mean by Michigan dogs there?</p>
<p>How to ship a shipping container on the Great Lakes, and how to float one downstream from Ann Arbor to the sea or up the lakes to the UP. &#0160;Portaging might be hard, especially with low water.</p>
<p>There will be a chance to write all these again, but sometimes the idea is overtaken by events, and then you have to have a new idea.</p>
