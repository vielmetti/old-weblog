        <p>My cousin Zorba wrote a eulogy for my great uncle Auch, who died last week at the age of 96. The whole thing is a bit too much to share right now, but there was one paragraph that really spoke to me about the sort of family I come from (and perhaps some insight into who I am) In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-04-eulogy-for-alfi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you could pay attention to just one thing over the next 15 minutes, what would it be? The list of categories of potential things to be alert to is too long, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to sort through them to find the right type of thing. Don&rsquo;t start by reviewing the list, because the list is too long to review without making that the one solitary task. It&rsquo;s always good to remove things from the desk or desktop, particularly if that can be done quickly and ruthlessly; similarly, closing applications is helpful. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-04-note-to-self-15/">&raquo;</a></p>
