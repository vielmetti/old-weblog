        <p>A friend asks, &quot;when did the Internet go commercial&quot;?&nbsp; Here's something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.
1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds
1989: Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.
1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.
1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-30-when-did-the-in/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bubble wrap!&nbsp; Who knew.
Build It Solar has the super-easy instructions, which involve cutting the wrap to the size of the window, spraying a thin film of water on the window, and letting the bubble wrap stick.&nbsp; Add a little glycerin perhaps if you have trouble removing it in the spring.
It's apparently a common practice in the greenhouse industry.
And it's more transparent and high tech than duct taping some foam insulation to the window. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-30-how-to-insulate/">&raquo;</a></p>

The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-24-financial-panic/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>as seen in this excellent NY Daily News article -
Galveston had a seawall To keep the water down, But the high tide from the ocean Washed water over the town. Wasn't that a mighty storm! Oh, wasn't that a mighty storm with water!
Wasn't that a mighty storm That blew all the people away! Their trumpets gave them warning, &quot;You'd better leave this place.&quot; They never thought of leaving Till death looked them in the face. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-15-wasnt-that-a-mi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn't find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&nbsp; &nbsp;
The &quot;bunny cutter&quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-12-bunny-biscuit-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Merlin Mann has relaunched 43 Folders; he doesn't want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&nbsp; It's a good choice.
He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-12-creativity-vs-p/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.
This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-08-reminder-system/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This recipe is much too easy this time of year when tomatoes are in abundance and taste great; don't even think of doing it with winter styrofoam tomatoes.
Sauce:
A little olive oil
Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller
Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh
Heat the olive oil in a pan.&nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don't bother to skin or peel or seed them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-07-anelletti-alla/">&raquo;</a></p>
