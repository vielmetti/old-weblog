        <p>From my inbox: My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a spider with a body about 3&frasl;4 an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the spider is only there during evening and night. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-29-pumpkin-spider/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For a bunch of reasons which I don't completely understand, there are gasoline shortages in the Atlanta area. The net is responding by using the #atlgas tag on Twitter to coordinate real time information about the location and availability of gasoline.&nbsp; To look at it the easiest way is through the twitter search for #atlgas.&nbsp; Some recent examples - wheelmom: #atlgas BP at I-85 and Clairmont. $4.39(!)

        <p>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&nbsp; I'm looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you'd get in &quot;petabytes per container&quot;.

        <p>Party like it's what year? The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-24-financial-panic/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans Fabricius) on September 7, 2008.&nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System's Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand. The best news article on this is from the Greenville, MI Daily News, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.&nbsp; A quote from this article: Doug Reeves, assistant chief of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources' Wildlife Division, said he's seen about seven northern black widows, &quot;usually when I'm digging around woodpiles.&quot; &quot;They're not particularly rare but they're not something that's found, unless you look in the right habitat,&quot; Reeves said. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-22-very-rare-south/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging. If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new. Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging. The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic. By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Whenever the power goes out, there's a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on. Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what's going on - there's a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.&nbsp; With hurricanes on their way, and dozens of different electric companies dealing with possible problems, it looked like a mess.&nbsp; So I made a map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-03-power-outage-ma/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>While it's still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net's response to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; I'm not putting a lot of links in this post. -- Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter looked like an actual help here for the folks I knew, both to help let others know where they were going (or whether they were staying) and to help make the evacuation process somewhat less isolating.&nbsp; &nbsp; Evacuation path: Those who left relatively early had relatively easier driving; by the time evacuation was underway in earnest the traffic jams were huge, some gas stations were temporarily out of gas, and the contraflow caused a lot of congestion when it ended.&nbsp; Twitter again seemed to be useful to help people figure out which non-Interstate highways looked like reasonable exit paths, or at least if it wasn't useful at that moment it was something to file away for next time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">&raquo;</a></p>
