<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor Link Bus starts service again next week.&nbsp; Every year I get tired of not being able to figure out when the bus is going to show up, and this year I tried to build a new map to help out.&nbsp; This is a work in progress.</p>

<p>The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I'll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.&nbsp; So the Y stop becomes an 11 stop, since the bus is supposed to get there at 11 26 41 56.</p>

<p>Google Maps now has a way to do custom icons, and I'm using letters from a Unicode alphabet to get the circled numbers.&nbsp; A few glitches still until I host those icons locally.&nbsp; It's hard to get the icons located precisely right at all scales and resolutions, don't know how to fix that (short of actually doing paste up on a paper map).</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.homelessdave.com">Dave Askins</a> is contributing a set of icons for the stop markers - the &ldquo;9&rdquo; stop there is the new and improved, which allows for better stop locating.</p>

      <p>We're back from a summer vacation on Cape Cod, and now it's time for back to school.&nbsp; Ann Arbor makes a very rapid transition from summer town to college town in the span of about 72 hours, and it's just about time for everything to change.</p>

<p>You know it's time for school to start when the next projects on your fun list are the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/link-bus-2008-m.html">new Link Bus schedule</a>, the football parking prices map, the 3d grade start of school picnic and the daycare potluck.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm still writing the Superpatron weblog, and working on an article on mobile versions of library catalogs, so that when you're on the go you can look up a book or when you're in the library you can remember what you were there for.</p>

<p>Really new for me this year is a fresh interest in law school - Deb starts at Wayne State Law today, and so there will be a lot more law related stuff to be aware of.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a sneaking suspicion that means a new blog, just to pull that stuff all to one place, since I'll bet there will be two posts a day to write about that experience if I choose to.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-supermemo-repet/">Supermemo: repetition is the very soul of the net</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I've told you once, I've told you 146 times: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22repetition+is+the+very+soul+of+the+net%22">repetition is the very soul of the net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a> is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.&nbsp; His 1992 masters thesis, <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm">Optimization of Learning</a>, covered the early work on Supermemo and a discussion of spaced repetition in learning.</p>

<p>I've been using some of the principles from SuperMemo, in particular the discussion of<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/paper.htm"> using SuperMemo without a computer</a>, to structure some organized retrospective looks at what I have been interested in over time and also to trigger follow up contacts with people and ideas that would have otherwise been forgotten.&nbsp; The important element of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> is used not to remember facts and figures but to trigger memory of people and the context I saw them in.&nbsp; The idea is that you structure a process to revisit previous days efforts - more recent days more frequently, and old days less frequently - and use that memory jogger to keep you connected.</p>

<p>What makes this newly easy (or at least easier) is some combination of tools and search engines not originally available in 1987, combined with my existing frequent blogging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me provide two examples, with some source code.</p>

<p>I keep a personal wiki with a page for each day.&nbsp; This is actually the second of those I have tried doing - the first was on custom pre-release versions of the Socialtext software and I reanimated it on the current Socialtext hosted platform.&nbsp; The notion is that you have a wiki page named &quot;2008 August 12&quot;, or really one page possible for every day, and you take notes on or about that day there or link to it to refer to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;There's a little bit of code that I wrote to make links from that page to a series of days spaced in the past and future which I include as a block on that page, making it easy to hyperlink forwards and backwards in time.&nbsp; That's good, as far as I do have things in my personal wiki (though maintaining that every day is a burden and I often have big blank spots when the burden of diligence is too great).</p>

<p>The second and more immediately practical approach uses search engines to replace explicit page dates to slice up the world into punctuated time slices.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use this with my weblog, creating searches like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Avielmetti.typepad.com+%22August+12%2C+2007%22">site:vielmetti.typepad.com &quot;August 12, 2007&quot;</a><br />to methodically revisit the past.&nbsp; As I said, it helps if you post daily, or have a tool like the delicious.com tag poster to do it for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The code I wrote which I'll share is based on &quot;day.sh&quot; which I released some time ago.&nbsp; That tool prints the date a specified time in the past; this new tool, &quot;<a href="http://monkey.org/~emv/src/spaced-days.tar">spaced-days</a>&quot;, creates a series of days formatted appropriately for whatever you want to paste them into.&nbsp; The sample I have generates Socialtext formatted wiki pages but minor edits will generate Mediawiki pages and more major ones could make HTML with the formatted searches above.</p>

<p>So if I'm thinking about my cousin's wedding two years ago, or next year's St Urho's Day celebrations, or the Burns Park Run for 2009, it's because there was just enough reminders to jog 1/n of my memory and not the whole darn thing.</p>

I wish I could say that I do all this, but at least it's something to

      <p>UPDATE: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/michigan-2008-election-results.html">Michigan election results for the November 2008 general election</a>, if you came here from a search.</p>

<p>The polls have closed, and results are just starting to trickle in at 8:30pm.   Here's some places to look for data.  (update: it's the next day and the votes are tallied)</p>

<p>The Michigan Secretary of State has <a href="http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/08PRI/">2008 Unofficial Michigan Primary Election Results</a> for all state-wide races, state senators and representatives, and judicial races. They also have links to <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1633_8722-103241--,00.html">Michigan primary election results by county</a> connected to almost all of the county clerk sites maintained around the state.</p>

<p>In Washtenaw County, there's a page with <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/indexreport.html">unofficial Washtenaw County election results for August 2008</a>, including <A href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/cumulativereport.html">cumulative results</a> and a breakdown by race.  Notable contested races are the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport382.html">Democratic primary Washtenaw Sheriff</a> election, and the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport544.html">15th District Judge</a> race.   The <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/08/roundup_of_results_in_washtena.html">Ann Arbor News has a roundup of results.</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oakgov.com/crts0006/controller">Oakland County non-partisan and proposal ballot results</a> include a proposal for a tax to support the zoo, which passed.   The <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080806/NEWS15/80806019">Detroit Free Press has complete 2008 August election results</a>.</p>

<p>All of the <a href="http://www.co.marquette.mi.us/clerk/results-1.htm">2008 Marquette County August primary</a> results are on one page.  (Two friends from high school are both running for judge.)  I expect to see <A href="http://www.miningjournal.net/">voting results at the Marquette Mining Journal</a>, but nothing there as of 9am Weds.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/DavidHelwig">David Helwig</a> (twitter) is covering the <a href="http://sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=33725">Chippewa County</a> elections for <a href="http://sootoday.com">SooToday</a>.</p>

<p>More details as anything is notable.  </p>

<p>Several newspapers have coverage with Twitter - the <a href="http://twitter.com/a2snooze">Ann Arbor News</a> has an (ahem) unofficial feed, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mlive">mLive</a> does some state-wide coverage.

1 ½ tablespoons honey<br />
3 tablespoons dry sherry (optional)<br />
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br />
Salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p>Cut the meat into one inch chunks and season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Heat a large Dutch oven or stew pot.  Drizzle in oil or bacon dripping to coat the bottom.  Working in batches, brown the meat well on all sides.  Add oil as necessary.  Do not over crowd the pan.  Remove browned meat to a clean dish and cover.</p>

<p>Once all the meat is browned, return it all to the pan with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.  Add stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and skim off any froth that has collected on the surface until the broth is clear.  Add the blueberries, honey, sherry, and cayenne pepper and bring back to a boil.</p>

<p>Simmer for 2 hours or until the meat is very tender and the broth has reduced.  Stir occasionally.  This helps to break up the blueberries and incorporate them into the liquid.  By the end of the cooking time the blueberries should be completely incorporated.</p>

<p>Serve with crusty bread and salad.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The primaries in Michigan are tomorrow, August 5 2008.</p>

<p>If you want a sample ballot, go to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/vote">Michigan Voter Information Center</a> run by the Michigan Secretary of State.  You'll put in your voter information, and it will come up with a list of elections on the ballot.  <a href="http://publius.org">Publius also generates Michigan sample ballots</a>, as does the <a href="http://thevoterguide3.mlive.com/?sfr">MLive Voter Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/elections/el_precincts.html">Washtenaw County precinct locations</a> is kept by the County Clerk and Register of Deeds, Larry Kestenbaum.  He's running unopposed for re-election.  </p>

<p>I'll be voting again this year using the AUTOMARK machine set up for vision impaired voters.  My notes from last time <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">show the problems I had with the AUTOMARK machine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Note for next time: vote early (and vote often), and tear the stub off before inserting the ballot into the AutoMARK machine, despite all of the instructions to the contrary.
</blockquote>

<p>My experience with AutoMARK is not unique - here's this season's clippings of people with problems:</p>

<p>Nassau County, NY: from the <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/NYSTEC-Finds-NY-SBOE-Votin-by-Rady-Ananda-080711-393.html">OpEd News</a> site (some political blog)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Nassau County purchased 450 ballot marking devices (BMDs) from Sequoia, at a cost of $12,000 each.  It reported that 85% of 240 machines were non-functional, one fifth of them damaged during shipment.  New York City also experienced software failure, when it tested ES&S AutoMARK's BMD, as attested at the June 23rd NYC Government Services Committee, reported Nassau County Attorney Lori Barrett.   </p>

<p>Ballot marking devices allow disabled voters to vote independently, printing the ballot for them, and would fulfill NY's compliance with the Help America Vote Act.  Yet a substantial portion of BMDs received in Nassau registered a printer failure.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>San Francisco is sold uncertified AutoMARK systems: from <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/elections_index.asp?id=70865">the San Francisco Department of Elections</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
On August 21, 2007, the Secretary of State announced a public hearing to examine ES&S's sale of uncertified AutoMARK machines to five California counties, including San Francisco.  In April 2006, San Francisco purchased 565 AutoMARKs from ES&S for $6,185.89 per machine, paying a total purchase price of nearly $3.5 million.  Unbeknownst to San Francisco at the time of the purchase, and as later reported by the Secretary of State, these 565 machines (as well as 407 AutoMARKs sold to other California counties) were uncertified.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after receiving the Secretary of State's statement, the Director of Elections confirmed that the voting machines ES&S sold San Francisco in April 2006 for use in the June 2006 and subsequent elections were the uncertified AutoMARK Model A200 machines.  But at the time of the sale, ES&S represented to San Francisco that it was providing AutoMARK Model A100 machines, which had been previously certified by the Secretary of State in August 2005, roughly seven months prior to San Francisco's purchase.  In fact, the machines ES&S provided were AutoMARK Model A200 machines, which had not been certified by the Secretary of State.  Unaware that ES&S's representations that the machines were certified were false, San Francisco unwittingly used what turned out to have been uncertified AutoMARK ballot marking machines in both the June 2006 and November 2006 elections. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Ed Felten's Freedom to Tinker blog on <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1269">California review of the ES&S AutoMARK and M100</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Yet still, they note that “We are not aware of any public device that has more flexibility in accommodating the wide range of physical and dexterity abilities that voters may have. The key, as always, is whether pollworkers and voters will be able to identify and implement the optimal input system without better guidance or expert support. In fact, it may be that the more flexible a system is, the more difficult it is for novices to navigate through the necessary choices for configuring the access options in order to arrive at the best solution.” One of their most striking findings was how long it took test subjects to use the system. Audio-only voters needed an average of almost 18 minutes to use the machine on a simplified ballot (minimum 10 minutes; maximum 35 minutes). Write-in votes were exceptionally difficult. And, again, this is arguably one of the best voting systems available, at least from an accessibility perspective.<br />

<p>Vote early (you might need the extra time!)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota.  From a <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/article.do?rid=189603">profile of Jim Johnson</a> by writer <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/artistHome.do?rid=11865">Cheryl Reitan</a> in the <a href="http://www.mnartists.org">mnartists.org</a> site:</p>

<blockquote>
JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.
</blockquote>

<p><b>In The Blueberry Bucket (from A Field Guide to Blueberries)</b><br />
<blockquote><br />
A man picks blueberries all day. In the bucket<br />
small green and withered sifting down,<br />
too old and squashed against the sides,<br />
twigs leave spruce needles settled to the bottom<br />
while the large ripe rise up to the top.<br />
So full of flesh, so ordinary?<br />
a woman, at sunset<br />
a blond woman leading a reindeer<br />
across the horizon. You are that woman. I am that man.<br />
And this I give to you<br />
is, if not the history of the world<br />
at the end of the day, but<br />
a bucketful of blueberries.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In blueberry picking news, we were at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">the Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> yesterday (August 2 2008) and picked a good quantity of berries - the big commercial high bush berries which are easier to fill buckets with, even if you are the only one picking and your traveling companions are mostly eating.</p>

<p><blockquote>
Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. &ldquo;It has the string sound of a viola,&rdquo; Kallet says, &ldquo;and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it&rsquo;s small enough that I can handle it easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the pieces on the record possess elements of Scandinavian melody and harmony, yet remain Balkan in rhythm.</p>

<p>"Cindy and I love to play Swedish and Norwegian traditional fiddle tunes in which the fiddlers play in harmony with each other," Larsen says. "It's a beautiful sound, and you can get four-part harmonies going with just two people."<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-01-laptop-backpack/">Laptop backpacks - summary of recommendations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I recently sent out an email query to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> mailing list about backpacks suitable for laptops.&nbsp; In the interests of not keeping useful information in my inbox, here's a summary of sorts.</p>

<p>The list, in no particular order, with some amount of incomplete information:</p>

<p>Land's End: the pack I have has a label, don't know the name of it in their catalog.&nbsp; It's nice.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.landsend.com/outfits/backpacks/index.html">Land's End backpack page</a> has more.</p>

<p>North Face: the Yavapai, &quot;carries not only my laptop but a change of clothes when I get to work by bike.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Industries: &quot;really like it. However, when I graduated from a MacBook to a Pro, the notebook was a bit too large, so definitely try inserting the notebook before purchasing.&quot;</p>

<p>Patagonia: Lightwire backpack &quot;a great deal&quot; right now at least <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/product/product_focus.jsp?OPTION=PRODUCT_FOCUS_DISPLAY_HANDLER&amp;style_color=48860-683&amp;ws=true&amp;catcode=WS.WEB_SPECIALS&amp;refferer=WSL">on sale now</a></p>

<p>Tom Bihn: &quot;As someone who has carried my laptop in it everywhere for the last 10 years, I highly recommend&quot; the <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0104">Brain Bag</a>.</p>

<p>Spire USA: &quot;I've been carrying a messenger vert bag from <a href="http://spireusa.com">Spire USA</a> for 9 years.&nbsp; Others in my family use the backpacks and love them as much as I love my bag.&nbsp; Their bags have had good attention to detail for people connected to their laptops.&quot;</p>

<p>Office Depot / Staples: &quot;For the budget minded I found the laptop backpacks at Office Depot/Staples to be very sufficient&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbpbags.com/hamptons_collection.html">BBP:</a> &quot;It's innovative, big, and while it's always in backpack mode - it still kinda looks like a messenger bag - which to my way of thinking makes it a 1/2 step more acceptable in the rare more formal meeting.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timbuk2.com">Timbuk 2</a>: &quot;I am using a Timbuk2 Messenger Bag that I got from Bivouac a few years ago.&nbsp; Great bag, and I think it will outlive ME!&quot;</p>

<p>Timbuk2 again: I have the Timbuk2 Underground. It's incredible spacious - I carry my MBP, DSLR + 2 lenses, several books in the main compartment. And then there are the 2 side pockets that carry numerous other gadgets, GPS, power cord, etc.</p>

<p>Franklin Covey: <a href="http://shopping.franklincovey.com/shopping/catalog/productaccessories.jsp?navAction=push&amp;navCount=0&amp;crc=cat129&amp;id=prod1710026&amp;skuid=32361">Victorinox</a>: &quot;This spring I finally found a backpack I am happy with.&nbsp; It is the world's greatest compter backpack.&nbsp; It can easily allow you to travel with two computers and accessories, or with just one computer and all your travel needs for a night or two.&nbsp; It shows no signs of wear after four months, but whenever it does fall apart, it will be the first time I ever happily buy the same model twice in a row.&nbsp; Oh, and did I mention that it costs less than $80?&quot;</p>

<p>Deuter: &quot;I have a Deuter that I bought at Bivouac several years ago. I bought the one that was called something like &quot;mega office&quot; or &quot;giga office&quot;. It's less daypack-y and more laptop-and-pens-n-stuff-hold-y than most of what Bivouac sells. It's been great - nice features, has aged well.&quot;</p>

<p>LL Bean: &quot;I love my LL Bean backpack. My mom got it for me when I was a senior in college (1993-94). It<br />
lived through that year, law school, marriage, our honeymoon (it was my carry-on), teacher certification classes, two teaching jobs, and it is still happy to ride on my back when I ride my bike. I love that bag&quot;</p>

<p>Brenthaven: &quot;I couldn't be a bigger fan of Brenthaven backpacks. I've had one of
their models for probably 8 years and it still looks brand new and is
amazingly well laid out. They are a bit spendy but I see no signs that
this thing will ever wear out.&quot;</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">management metrics: &#34;queue depth days&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In the manage by numbers world...</p>

<p>One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress.  At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.</p>

<p>If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time.   End the day with 100 unanswered messages 100 days in a row, and your queue-depth-day is 10000 (eek).</p>

<p>There are of course three ways to attack this problem (at least, but bear with me)</p>

<p>1.  Reduce the size of the current queue, so that there's less to deal with right now;<br />
2.  Reduce the influx into the queue, so that there's less to deal with every day;<br />
3.  Increase the speed at which things are removed from the queue, so they don't stay so long.</p>

<p>The inbox zero mantra pulls from all of these, but you really need to understand the impact of all three to attack this.  One time heroic measures to empty the inbox are necessary, because you can't create a bunch of lasting improvement if there's a big overhang of undone work nagging at you.  Slowing down flows inbound helps reduce the rate of queue depth growth, but doesn't clear the queue.  And working faster to acknowledge email just creates more email!</p>

<p>Classic solutions to this whole system is to move communications out of queued systems into either real time systems (IM, chat, voice) or into asynchronous multiplayer games (blogs, wikis).  The hard core communications people completely shut down their email system and go entirely to the other extremes; the other hard core communications people treat their email inbox AS IF IT WERE IM and always answer and file everything instantly.</p>

<p>The queue depth could be anything, really; it could be outstanding phone calls to make, emails to answer, people standing in line in your retail operation, customers waiting impatiently for a call back to solve their time critical problem, or forms needing to be filled out.  Just know that in any system where you can get stuff coming in faster than you can get rid of it queues will form, and at worst they back up to the point where other people can see that you're not on top of everything.</p>

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).<br />

<blockquote><br />
We've all been there, that sickening feeling as you reach for your back pocket, only to find your wallet gone. A frantic search turns up nothing. You feel sad. But you wouldn't feel that sad if you had photocopied the contents of your wallet. Then you would have a legal copy of your license to use until it got replaced, and all your account numbers and the phone numbers you need to call for replacements. So take a second this weekend to pop your wallet into the photocopy or scanner and keep the paper in a safe place. You might be very glad some day that you did.<br />

I really hate it when people suggest photocopying your wallet contents for extra safety. Call me crazy (many people do) and paranoid (there’s some truth to that as well), but a photocopier is nothing but a scanner plus a printer. There’s no guarantee that your info is cleared out as soon as the pages are printed. If it’s your own copier in your own home office, fine, but if you take your wallet to Kinkos or CopyMax or any commercial place, keep in mind that what you’re doing is using their scanner to scan all the numbers you’re carefully protecting other places.<br />

1) Make a backup. Years ago, someone suggested that I put a scan of my critical documents up on the Internet where I could always access them from anywhere. So I scanned my passport, driver's license, and birth certificate in a password-protected file that I mailed to a supplemental Yahoo account. It was easy to just download and print it to have all of the information and documentation that the embassy required.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>After a small set of discussions today with people I won't blog about, here's some ideas from people I don't know using a phrase I thought I might have made up: "service as a service".</p>

<p>James Urquhart's "The Wisdom of Clouds" on <a href="http://blog.jamesurquhart.com/2008/03/service-as-service-market-explored.html">Service as a Service Market Explored</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Real quick, David Linthicum has a cool post on the move in the market from human-oriented SaaS (Software as a Service) to systems oriented SaaS--perhaps better named "Service as a Service". The naming is a little nerdy, but David is right on about this being an ultimate goal of the SaaS market, as well as of cloud computing in general.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>chase that reference to this <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/03/when_saas_means.html">Intelligent Enterprise article on When SaaS Means 'Services as a Service' </a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
StrikeIron is the one that comes to mind. StrikeIron is not a SaaS provider, but a SaaS provider with the first S being 'Services' vs. 'Software.' They offer a variety of services, such as SMS text messaging, tax rate calculations, address validation, etc. The objective being not to provide the holistic application, but simple components that can be abstracted into enterprise and SaaS applications, as needed, for a small monthly subscription fee. Thus, you don't write it, you don't test it, you don't host it, you just leverage its functionality at a fraction of the cost if you developed the same service in-house.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>hm, perhaps a little bit too "granular" (oh I love to hate that word; coarse, Demera, what are you talking, sugar?).  Another try goes down the manufacturing route - envisioning cheap frictionless production of one-off quantities of things, in this case printed letters sent through the mail.  The <a href="http://blog.postful.com/2007/10/29/manufacturing-as-a-service-maas/">Postful blog on Manufacturing as a Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The modern service cloud ushers in a fundamental shift in our accounting of economic costs. The endemic overhead in even the most basic of deals and transactions is perhaps the key factor in determining the structure of our economic systems at all scales. The service cloud can reduce those transaction costs to negligible levels.
</blockquote>

<p>and finally perhaps this one from <a href="http://jrsays.com/2007/09/software-as-service-objectification-of.html">JR Says on the objectification of business processes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I know the term “Service-as-a-service” sounds like an idiotic reference to nothing, but my point is that business services can finally be delivered in a way which is easily acquirable by customers, as true services, with:
- clear, non-obtrusive contracts (the business kind… you know, ToS you feel no obligation to read ;)
- clear communication contracts (the implementation kind… “you give us A , we give you B”)
- pay as you go – with clear pricing
- strong support (imagine that)
</blockquote>

<p>I went to Cuil (gaelic for "fail") for the last word; it's a good one.  Via <a href="http://www.cubiccompass.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,794ab498-c692-4eb4-b3c7-b02c9e0917e2.aspx">Cubic Compass</a>, quoting <a href="http://www.tcg-advisors.com/who/lay.htm">Philip Lay</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"What is likely to no longer work is the conventional time and materials model of expensive "manual" services, now seen to be highly inefficient unless enabled by increasing use of automation.  What must be made to work is to have virtually every service substantially automated and deliverable online once the service in question has been transformed from a custom, never-done-before, thing to a repeatable and relatively routine activity."

      </h3>
      <p>I've typed some things about bug camp, but haven't blogged about it.</p>

<p>The name of the place is not really bug camp; it's the <a href="http://www.pagecenter.org/">Page Center</a> in Little Lake, MI:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Our peaceful, natural setting on Little Lake is the perfect place for your next retreat, reunion, wedding, reception or workshop. Located 3 miles East of M-35/553, approximately 24 miles south of Marquette.<br />
</blockquote><br />
It's a nice spot, a former church camp, with a lovely main house, a dining hall and kitchen, and eight bunk cabins.  We had 25 there for a family reunion and everything worked out well.</p>

<p>There are bugs there - quite a few dragon flies, one alder beetle that had a nickname ("Mango"), and a bunch of little non-biting flies that swarmed the night time lights.  As bugs go very tame, no ticks, no black flies, no deer flies, no horse flies, no sand flies (I could go on and on with biting insects that weren't there).  The woods had blueberries (not yet ripe) and wintergreen.</p>

<p>Little Lake is just outside of Gwinn, and we were there for the 4th of July (amazing parade).  I went into town with my older son one afternoon and we hung out at the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2007/01/forsyth_townshi.html">Forsyth Township Public Library</a> for a while and shopped at the Gwinn St. Vincent de Paul store (easily the biggest store in town).</p>

<p>I owe a certain special someone a night in a swanky hotel in exchange for all of the bugs - but it really was nice.</p>

<p>(There is another "bug camp" - the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs/">U of Michigan Bio Station in Pellston</a> has the same nickname and some of the same bugs and general camp architecture.)</p>

<p>(Here's the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/a_field_guide_t.html">2003 blueberry picking report</a> with several locations near the Page Center mentioned.)</p>

      <p>Here's a bit of science fiction I'd like to read -</p>

<p>The time is the future, but the near future, within reach - perhaps 2012.  The hero has some kind of cognitive deficit that's progressive, so that they are slowly losing their ability to reason.  (Think Flowers for Algernon, for instance.)</p>

<p>The twist is that the nature of the loss of thinking is that they are fine in person and in everything they normally do, but that they are unable to effectively use search engines any more.  And so the near-term always on instant recall of every obscure fact in the world is slipping away from them - bit by bit - as search engine result pages get more and more inscrutable.</p>

      <p>It's blueberry season, and so one of the things you want to do is buy some berries.  Here's how.</p>

<p>For stock photography, Featurepix has a photo of <a href="http://www.featurepics.com/online/Fresh-Michigan-Blueberries-Bush-Photo423346.aspx">fresh Michigan blueberries on a bush</a>; the original photo is $4.

I don't know the exchange rate).</p>

<p>At retail, Busch's in Ann Arbor is currently selling them for $14.99 for a 5 pound box, or $1.99 per pint (on sale from $2.99/pint).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.therussellcorp.com/berries/#Hours%20of%20Operation%20/%20Season">Russell's Blueberry Farm</a> in Freeland, MI (near Saginaw) has posted 2007 prices of $2.10/lb wholesale, and $1.45/lb u-pick.  Call for 2008 pricing.</p>

If you sell these, we would like a quote. Thanks".  The <a href="http://www.reendersblueberryfarms.com/store.html">web site for the Reenders Blueberry Farm</a> lists 2008 prices, 10 pounds for $21.50.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blueberrylanefarms.com/">Blueberrry Lane Farms</a> in Otter Lake, MI, northeast of Flint, MI has U-Pick $1.80/lb, and 10 lb pre-pick with box $35.00.

The farm has been in blueberry production since 1949 and the <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?SEQ_NO_115=134437">Elliott blueberry</a> was developed there.</p>

<p>Wild berries in the UP should be good near the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/06/sleeper-lake-fi.html">Sleeper Lake Fire</a> area; stay near <a href="http://www.cabincam.net/tourism.html">Paradise, Michigan</a> or <a href="http://www.newberrychamber.net/">Newberry, Michigan</a> or <a href="http://www.pinestumpjunction.com/">Pine Stump Junction, Michigan</a> or <a href="http://www.natureskennel.com/links.htm">McMillan, Michigan</a> (home of the Generic Motel, "clean, cheap").

In our part of Michigan (Topinabee) the woods are thick with wild blueberries toward the end of July and the beginning of August. I hope you enjoy my images.

<p>There's lots of pictures, and lots of comments on the pictures, including this one from "jrgoflo":</p>

<blockquote>
I loved these pictures. There's really nothing better than Wild Michigan blueberries. My favorite place to pick them is at the Shelldrake Dam State Forest Campground NW of Paradise in the U.P. or the Betsy Lake area of Tahquamenon Falls State Park. I've just planted 10 lowbush blueberry shrubs at my house. Can't wait!!
