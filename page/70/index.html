<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-08-twitter-zero/">twitter zero</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I love Twitter - I love being in the flow of the world with the off hand comments of hundreds of friends around the world triggering all sorts of warm feelings and thoughts about how lucky I am to know so many people in so many places.</p>

<p>For that very same reason, I&#39;m working towards getting off Twitter, my &quot;twitter zero&quot; project, where I unfollow everyone I&#39;ve been following.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Twitter Zero is inspired by a few other &quot;zero&quot; projects, including Merlin Mann&#39;s &quot;Inbox Zero&quot; and Alan Gutierrez&#39;s &quot;Reader Zero&quot;.&#0160; The basic idea is that in systems where there is an infinite capacity for the world to send messages to get your attention, the only reasonable queue that you can leave between visits to the system is zero, because if you get behind you will never, ever, ever catch up gradually.&#0160; Never.&#0160; No matter how much time you put into it, there will always be more to do, and you will lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that you say, you love twitter, why make it go away?&#0160; For the same reason that I love weblogs (really I do; you are reading this one) and I don&#39;t read any blogs in a feed reader.&#0160; And I love getting email (really I do) and spend too much of my time ignoring and deleting email.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t keep up.&#0160; No one can keep up, actually - we look at something shiny and say &quot;ooh shiny&quot; and start following it because it was shiny then (and shiny once) and then suddenly you look back a week later and note to self &quot;hm, not shiny any more, but it&#39;s a lot harder to stop paying attention to it once you&#39;re connected to it&quot;.</p>

<p>So, go to zero.&#0160; Turn off Twitter, don&#39;t let it interrupt you any more.&#0160; But still listen.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Twitter is great for ambience awareness of things around the world, perfect actually.&#0160; With the new search interface you can see at a glance when there are earthquakes, what television shows are on, who&#39;s winning what football games, when the Mormon Church is having a global conference, Girl&#39;s Night Out, you name it there&#39;s some super-cool global event that you can tap into without doing much more than a few follows.</p>

<p>Follow follow follow follow...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll argue for the sake of arguing that we as human beings have a finite supply of attention for ambient awareness of things around the world; there&#39;s only so many neurons that can fire in one moment to keep track of what&#39;s happening, and my poor aging brain has some finite ability to keep track. You make tradeoffs, you have to.&#0160; And the fact that I know just a little bit too much about popular television due to twitter has to be responsible for some other deficit in my life, like not getting quite enough sleep, or not cleaning the garage (or even more to the point noticing that there are parts of it that need attention).&#0160; </p>

<p>Or paying attention to my boys.&#0160; They are little.&#0160; They won&#39;t be little forever.&#0160; They don&#39;t use Twitter, yet - yet? - though the older one was asking about connections between the computer and my phone (he seemed to think that Bluetooth would be involved.&#0160; he&#39;s eight.&#0160; how do they do this?)</p>

<p>Attention is a precious resource.&#0160; Twitter is a distraction.&#0160; Email is a distraction.&#0160; This blog is a distraction.&#0160; Pretty much everything is a distraction on the Internet, either designed to capture an eyeball or rewire a neuron or to short circuit the brain to wallet function.&#0160; And sometimes the only reasonable response to a thoroughly enjoyable distraction is to make a very visible, very annoying, very painful decision to skip this particular distraction and move on.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Before inbox zero, before twitter zero, there was Usenet Zero.&#0160; &#0160;One by one, a series of people who had spent a lot of time building up that network made decisions, some private and some noisily public, to give up on that network and go off and build some other network of their own.</p>

<p>Noisy public exits are cathartic - they let you say something that has been building up over time and get it all out of your system, and rather than try to fight the fight of 1000 tiny cuts you simply say &quot;screw it&quot; and let off some steam and disentangle from the world you had been in all at once.&#0160; You go away in a ball of fire and are memorable for your absence, at least for a little while, at least until someone else&#39;s attention span is diverted momentarily into the latest minor earthquake or Digg headline or caribou joke or heart attack rumor.</p>

<p>Giving up on a network is one way to build a new network.&#0160; Who notices when you go?&#0160; Who actually cares?&#0160; Exit stage left (in flames) is more effective at some momentary attention grab than simply quietly receding into the background.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;m giving up on Twitter feeds, I&#39;m not really giving up on Twitter.&#0160; There&#39;s too much there to ignore.&#0160; But I&#39;m changing my approach.</p>

<p>Rather than the passive rat-lever-pellet approach to waiting for an update from a Twitter pal, I&#39;m going to be using the Twitter search tools as the primary point of contact.&#0160; &#0160; This is the &quot;Kibo&quot; strategy.</p>

<p>Kibo?</p>

<p>If you were on Usenet at a certain time, there was someone called Kibo, who was virtually everywhere.&#0160; Every newsgroup you posted in, if someone mentioned his name, he showed up with a comment.&#0160; That was unusual, because who could follow 1400 newsgroups and read everything.&#0160; </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not how Kibo did it, and not how I did the same thing when I ran the Usenet newsgroup comp.archives.&#0160; Instead of following the network by group, you follow it by keyword, and anyone who uses that word or set of words is part of your world.&#0160; For comp.archives, it meant that every time someone typed in the word FTP, I&#39;d find that post, and one time out of ten those were announcements of new software.&#0160; A systematic effort to collect those announcements and repost them and index them followed.</p>

<p>That was hard in the Usenet era (I ended up hacking on emacs lisp to do it) but very easy in the Twitter era, and it&#39;s a better strategy by far.&#0160; If you want to change the things you focus on, you don&#39;t need to add and subtract friends, you just need to modulate your filters.</p>

</p><blockquote><p>
And maybe that&#39;s the answer: A Facebook app we&#39;ll call the Fade Utility. Untended Friends would gradually display a sepia cast on the picture, a blurring of the neglected profile—perhaps a coffee stain might appear on it or an unrelated phone number or grocery list. The individual&#39;s status updates might fade and get smaller. The user may then choose to notice and reach out to the person in some meaningful way—no pokes! Or they might pretend not to notice. Without making a choice, they could simply let that person go. Would that really be so awful?

      <p>Platnick, N. I. 2008. The world spider catalog, version 9.0. American Museum of Natural
&nbsp; &nbsp; History, online at <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/index.html">http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/index.html</a></p>

<p><p>The World Spider Catalog is a thorough catalog of the scientific literature regarding spiders, with a special attention paid to classification and taxonomy.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The organization of the entries is hierarchically determined; hence synonymies at the
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic level are indicated under the family (and cross-referenced under the appropriate
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic) listings, but affected species are listed separately only if there are significant
&nbsp; &nbsp; references to them in particular. Similarly, synonymies at the species level are listed under
&nbsp; &nbsp; generic, rather than familial, headings. Unlike Roewer and Brignoli, I have not attempted to
&nbsp; &nbsp; segregate species within large genera on a geographic basis. Their listings are often
&nbsp; &nbsp; confusing, with widespread species being hard to locate and easy to overlook. Spider
&nbsp; &nbsp; systematics has suffered too much from narrow regionalism to encourage strictly faunistic
&nbsp; &nbsp; approaches in any way! The brief descriptions of geographic ranges are provided only as a
&nbsp; &nbsp; general guide; no attempt has been made to ensure that they are comprehensive.</p></blockquote><p>Cataloging the world&rsquo;s spiders is hard work, and <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/COUNTS.html">this collection lists (at the current reading) 3694 genera and 40462 species.&nbsp; </a>Unsurprisingly, then, you&rsquo;ll need to go elsewhere for pictures and descriptions, but the <a href="http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/BIBLIO.html">exhaustively complete bibliography going back to 1757 will get you started.</a>&nbsp; 1757?&nbsp; Yes, 1757.&nbsp; The oldest spider so cataloged is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivantortuga/2401539306/">Salticus scenicus, which is pictured here (photo IvanTortuga), the zebra spider</a><br />The cite is </p><blockquote><p>Clerck, C.

advances in spider ecology to individual authors who were instrumental
in shaping our current understanding of ecology as a modern science.
The motivation for this paper is to reveal to the ecological community
some of the best early research in the first half of the 20th century
when it is believed that ecological spider experiments really began.
This period has remained elusive to most researchers, because the
majority of ecological literature pre-1970 is not available
electronically and ecological research tends to have a short citation

      </h3>
      <p>In the &quot;this might be too weird for this year's Halloween costume&quot; department:</p>

<p><p>from<a href="http://livedesignonline.com/theatre/no_one_meaner/"> Live Design Online, &quot;No One Meaner than a Vacuum Cleaner&quot;</a></p><blockquote><p>The opera (Evil Machines) features wild cars and other evil machines, pitted against
friendly household appliances, including a beautiful egg whisk and the
alarm clock that loves her. Veteran costume designer and Monty Python
movie alum James Acheson had a hand in designing the opening chorus of
six evil vacuum cleaners. The chorus is joined by a 15&rsquo; giant evil
vacuum cleaner, who — with the help of an inflatable body, a fan, and
some CO2 — literally bursts with pride, showering dust and bed bugs over the orchestra and the first few rows of the audience.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7180000/newsid_7184500/7184582.stm">The BBC has a video with a Terry Jones interview and some of the dancing vacuums</a> (sorry, can&rsquo;t embed it).</p><blockquote><p>Opera singers appear as giant appliances in Monty Python creator Terry
Jones&rsquo; new &lsquo;opera&rsquo; Evil Machines which is being premiered in Lisbon,
Portugal.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/jan/16/theatre3">The Guardian weighs in (in Jan 2008) </a></p><blockquote><p>Evil Machines, a new opera devised and directed by Monty Python star
Terry Jones, looks set to come to London. Starring singing
tumble-dryers, a giant red telephone and a 15ft-tall vacuum cleaner, it
has just opened in Portugal, to standing ovations.</p></blockquote><p>Too weird for words, but topical and seasonally appropriate in the oddest way; see at 2:40 in the video below.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>in some extremely silly world, here are practical ways to get dressed for Halloween as a vacuum cleaner with attachments.<br /><a href="http://www.coolest-homemade-costumes.com/original-halloween-costumes.html"><br />From &quot;coolest homemade costumes dot com&quot; in their home appliances section:</a></p><blockquote><p>My husband started with an empty box, free from the grocery store
and cut it down to fit her. He then wrapped it in some black vinyl,
attached some parts from old vacuums we had in the garage (handle, hose
and attachment, caddy with brushes). The red Hoover emblem was a piece
of red sticky-backed felt. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The feet (power head) were two
pieces of 4&quot; foam hollowed out, one on each foot for movement. We
decorated them with more red felt displaying 12 amps and aluminum foil
for a headlight. While trick or treating so many people asked her to
clean their houses for fun! </p></blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <p><a href="http://dailypress2.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=8231&amp;si=Vacuum">A red upright Hoover costume for a 3 year old</a> (photo at link)<br /><a href="http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/season/feature/costume_contest_dirt/"><br />Disney's Family Fun has this one, submitted by Julie L of Arglye TX:</a></p><blockquote><p>Made with a black sweatsuit and red felt, the vacuum bag portion of
this costume gets its full shape from newspaper stuffing, while foam
core is used to make the sweeper. Toilet paper rolls painted black and
attached to a knit cap create the handle, and a black cord is the final
touch to the wearable appliance.
</p></blockquote><p>Finally, here's a twist I hadn't expected: rather than you dressing as a vacuum, dress your vacuum (in this case the Roomba robot vacuum) in <a href="http://myroombud.com/roombafrogger.html">a Frogger costume from myRoomBud.</a> </p>

The video commentary:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">Ever
since Phillip Torrone
and Limor Fried played
Roomba Frogger down in
Texas, we wanted to play
it too except we could
not afford to use one
of our Roombas &hellip; so
we hacked a Frogger game
to use one our RoomBud
costume characters, Roobit
the Frog. Well that wasn&rsquo;t
good enough so using a
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=3&amp;idproduct=1">RooTooth</a>
from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roombadevtools.com/">RoombaDevTools</a>
for the wireless bluetooth
connection to our computer
and a bit more coding,
we put together a game
that we can play on the
computer and have Roobit
the Frog RoomBud actually
run along the floor doing
the same maneuvers as
the Frogger character.
When you get your little
Roobit across the river,
your Roomba will start
to vacuum!</span></p></blockquote></p>

      </h3>
      <p>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.newsagencyblog.com.au/2008/10/03/calendar-strategy-delivers-results.html">Australian Newsagency Blog<br /><br /></a></p><blockquote><p>Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston.</p>

<p>At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season.</p>

<p>At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously
this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on
a more unique range of titles. We have given over a column at the front
of the store to promote our calendar range as well as to feature a <strong>Calendar of the Week</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually when people talk about a &quot;calendar of the week&quot;, they talk about &quot;a calendar of the next week's events&quot;.&nbsp; Here, we have &quot;an entirely new calendar of the year, so that if you gave up on last week's calendar because you got bored of seeing pictures of fuzzy bunnies, here's a new one of fuzzy kittens.&quot;</p>

<p>Remarkable (and a great idea).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every week on Thursday I host a lunch at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor; you're invited.&nbsp; One regular element of that lunch is helping figure out what events are happening the upcoming weekend and weeks ahead so that people can find help in publicizing those events or tell people about something they are looking forward to.</p>

<p>I've tried a zillion difficult ways to keep the calendar for that group, none of which are ideal, mostly because they involve some kind of calendar system which requires more precision than I have time to deal with and which makes me type things into fields.</p>

<p>The hack (and really it's a hack) for the last few weeks has been to use <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Talk:A2b3">the talk page on the group's page on Arborwiki as a public calendar, </a>or more precisely, to use it for me as a quick place to cut and paste things so that when the time comes I know enough to tell people about that.&nbsp; An interesting advantage to doing it in wiki vs. in a calendar system is that I can hyperlink e.g. the name of a theater to the page for that theater and get (for free) all of the location and venue information along with it.</p>

<p>Is it perfect?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is there some refinement of it which might work better?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Is it handy?&nbsp; You bet.</p>

      <p>I wrote up a list of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/01/ten_places_to_h.html">ten places to have a birthday party for kids in Ann Arbor</a> about a year ago; it's proven to be a popular post.&nbsp; I thought I'd do a new list completely different from the first.&nbsp; As always check for availability and pricing before you plan.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Frisinger_Park">Frisinger Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A few picnic tables near the playground with lots of things to do for
kids (slides, swings, a merry-go-round, a sandbox) and a big field to run in. Shady for
those hot days. Avoid it on football Saturdays. Free.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Gallup_Park">Gallup Park</a> (summer and fall).&nbsp; A dock on the Huron River is perfect for a party where the kids go fishing. (worms work great).&nbsp; There's a snack bar with coffee for the adults, and a play area with lots of things to climb and bounce on.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; Get your fishing license online with the <a href="http://www.mdnr-elicense.com/welcome.asp">Michigan DNR E-License.</a></p>

<p>3.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.exhibits.lsa.umich.edu/exhibitmuseum/publicprogrms/planetarium/">Exhibit Museum Planetarium</a> (indoors).&nbsp; They're closed as of this writing, preparing to install a new all-digital projection system; sign up for their mailing list to find out more.&nbsp; </p>

<p>4.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Michigan_Firehouse_Museum">Michigan Firehouse Museum</a>, Ypsilanti (indoors).&nbsp; Old fire engines are the draw in this museum located in an old fire house near Ypsi's Depot Town.&nbsp; </p>

<p>5.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jiffy_Mix">Jiffy Mix factory tour</a>, Chelsea (indoors).&nbsp; Tour the factory, see how Jiffy Mix is made.&nbsp; Age 6 and up, tours Mon-Fri, so it's probably a summer time event or a holiday event.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Southern_Michigan_Railroad_Society">Southern Michigan Railroad Society,</a> Clinton MI.&nbsp; Museum train runs from Clinton to Tecumseh on the old Jacksonburgh and Palymra track; there's a museum in Clinton with old railroad stuff on the main floor and a working shop downstairs for repair of their rolling stock.&nbsp; Call them to see how they handle groups.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Wasem's_Fruit_Farm">Wasem's Fruit Farm</a>, Milan MI.&nbsp; Take the crew out for apple picking or pumpkin picking, watch the donut robot make delicious <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:Donuts">donuts.</a>&nbsp; Call ahead to see if they will be making cider, they don't always do it on busy weekends.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Cider_Mill">Dexter Cider Mill</a>, Dexter MI.&nbsp; No apples to pick here - they bring them in - but a great old cider press in the basement of this old mill on the Huron River.&nbsp; Again, donuts.&nbsp; (Mmm, donuts.)&nbsp; Watch for flying insects!</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ray_Fisher_Stadium">Ray Fisher Stadium</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Take the team to a University of Michigan baseball game during the spring season.&nbsp; </p>

<p><p>10.&nbsp; <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Yost_Ice_Arena">Yost Ice Arena</a>, Ann Arbor.&nbsp; Look for wintertime open skate times.</p><br /></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-when-did-the-in/">When did the internet go commercial, part two: &#34;buy now&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A follow up on the earlier post about the commercialization of the internet -</p>

<p>Once the basic data infrastructure of the Internet was open to commercial use - which starts in late 1991, and accelerates rapidly from there - you start to get slowly and then at a rapidly accelerating pace the appearance of businesses online who are selling things to people directly.</p>

<p>Some milestones there as well:</p>

<p>1993: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011221102015/www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,299047,00.html">Fry Multimedia launches web sites for Godiva, Ragu</a>; mostly marketing and advertising not sales.<br />December 1993: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n2_v13/ai_16675341/pg_4">Jon Zeeff in Ann Arbor's Branch Mall adds Grant's Flower and Greenhouse for online floral delivery;</a> he gets 40 orders via the Internet for Mother's Day, compared to 45 via FTD.<br />1994: First Virtual Holdings founded; enables internet based credit card payments.<br />July 1995: Amazon.com goes online<br />1995: Netcom, an Internet service provider, loses 20000 credit card numbers to online hackers.</p>

<p>The tipping point in retrospect is when people are willing to type their credit card numbers into web sites to order products.&nbsp; First Virtual was built on the assumption that you needed new infrastructure because card numbers were so risky; Amazon could launch without that assumption a year and some later and cope with shy buyers by providing alternate methods for getting card numbers to the system.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-gno-organizing/">#gno: organizing a network-wide chat on twitter</a>
      </h3>
      <p>#gno stands for &quot;Girl's Night Out&quot;.&nbsp; It's trending right now on search.twitter.com.&nbsp; (Yes I am up late; but this is fascinating, I've never seen this particular behavior on twitter before.)</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see topics trend on search.twitter.com when there are a lot of hipster people in some hipster city at some hipster tech conference.&nbsp; A zillion people who are all mostly in the same building will use the same tag to post comments on the event.&nbsp; At this point that's &quot;ordinary&quot;.</p>

<p>#gno is different - it's a virtual event, <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/search/label/twitter%20GNO">synchronized in time and organized by this loosely affiliated collection of what are charmingly called these days &quot;mommybloggers&quot;.</a>&nbsp; The time sync is important, so that everyone is on the same page, but not everyone knows each other or follows each other on twitter.&nbsp; This made their first couple of rounds of attempts somewhat frustrating.</p>

<p>The new go-around though seems to be catching on enough that it's a #1 hit (in the twitter universe of 15 minutes of fame), even outpacing the LA earthquake (3.0 magnitude) and perpetual favorite Sarah Palin.&nbsp; How did they do it?</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Loosely coupled networks - blog networks - where there are lots of people linking to each other.&nbsp; If you had been part of this network you would have known about it from multiple sources.&nbsp; Like a lot of internet ideas, one way to spread it is to <a href="http://goodandcrazypeople.blogspot.com/2008/09/first-evah-twitter-gno.html">link to all the people who are part of it (example here)</a> and get them to reciprocate.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Tightly synchronized timing - a twitter schedule - where lots of people are asked to show up at a particular time.&nbsp; The time is key; if you say &quot;some time tonight&quot; you'll get a lot less peak time traffic than if you say &quot;11pm Eastern on the dot&quot;.&nbsp; And while lots of traffic over a long time is interesting, peak traffic is what makes you visible outside your bubble.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; A willingness to iterate on tools.&nbsp; To make this work you need to set some guidelines so that new people joining the network have a recipe to follow to let them be part of it; at the same time, you need to be prepared to switch that recipe from week to week to make it work better or if the tools themselves change.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Someone to be a (nominal or actual) leader who can count noses, decide things, set the network into motion, collect people who are at the fringe and welcome them in, and post the results to improve next time you do it.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp; Low risk cost of entry into the world (all you have to do is type this tag) and access to a user population who is willing to experiment once on something.</p>

<p>Pretty neat, replicable I suppose.&nbsp; You should be able to draw parallels from ham radio, where DX contests get a lot of people on the air at once.&nbsp; There's a similar effect during University of Michigan football games, where when &quot;Michigan&quot; starts to trend you can count on finding other alumni and fans from around the world tuning in.&nbsp; Television shows synchronize people remarkably well (almost terrifying how well).</p>

<p>More from an earlier post: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/11/what-does-mean-.html">What does # mean on Twitter? All about octothorpetags. </a>which I wrote in November 2007 after #sandiegofire.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A friend asks, &quot;when did the Internet go commercial&quot;?&nbsp; Here's something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.</p>

<p>1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds<br />1989: <a href="http://www.std.com/">Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA</a> goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.<br />1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.<br />1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet<br />1991: <a href="http://www.msen.com">MSEN</a> goes online as one of the first commercial ISPs in Michigan.&nbsp; <br />1993: ANS CO+RE joins CIX</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jep;cc=jep;rgn=main;idno=3336451.0001.121;view=text#idno_3336451.0001.121">Internet Cost Structures and Interconnection Agreements</a> goes into (too much) details about how the money flows between commerical networks; it is a viewpoint from 1995 of the Internet then.&nbsp; But basically I'd put a date as August 1991 when you could buy an internet connection from one commercial provider and use it to send data to a customer on another commercial provider and not violate any acceptable use politics along the way.</p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>

<p><p>
The last thing is, once you&rsquo;ve got your day-timer, make a note for 30 days from today - it&rsquo;s okay if that one goes &quot;ding&quot; to remind you! - and revisit this talk in 30 days. It will be up on the web, courtesy of Gabe, and ask: &quot;What have I changed?&quot; If I haven&rsquo;t changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you&rsquo;ll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that&rsquo;s important. Time is all we have.

      </h3>
      <p>From my inbox:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>
with a body about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger
than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my
house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> is only there during evening and night. We think it hides in the bush the rest of the day.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we found it I did a lot of research and I am pretty sure that it is an Araneus trifolium (<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span>, shamrock <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>).
It has the rings around the legs and is the right size. It is in the
right time of year, has the right type of web, and has the right kind
of behavior.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know whether it’s male or female. How do I figure out? Are
Araneus Trifolium poisonous? Are they common where we live? Can you
look at the pictures and figure out if I’m right and it is Araneus
trifolium? (they are attached)</p></blockquote><p>and my response:</p></p>

<p>Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the pictures of your <span class="nfakPe">spider</span>.&nbsp; It looks like it is enjoying this time of year!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<span class="nfakPe">Pumpkin</span> spiders are very common this time of year, and they are found all over Michigan.&nbsp; Spiders can be very hard to identify from photos, because there are so many species of them, but it seems that you have made a good identification.<br />
<br />
The reference I'm looking at is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257">http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a><br />
<br />
Shorthouse, David P. submitted. Taxonomic and natural history description of FAM: ARANEIDAE, Araneus trifolium (Hentz, 1847). In: The Nearctic <span class="nfakPe">Spider</span> Database. David P. Shorthouse (editor). World Wide<br />
Web electronic publication. Direct link:<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canadianarachnology.org/data/spiders/15257"> http://www.<wbr></wbr>canadianarachnology.org/data/<wbr></wbr>spiders/15257</a> (Accessed:<br />
9/28/2008 10:55:02 PM).<br />
<br />
which describes both males and females of this species.&nbsp; From that page it seems that females are more often seen later in the season, that they are larger than the males, and that their distinctive leg rings (&quot;annulations&quot;) are more distinctive than the males.&nbsp; So I'm guessing that it's a female, but you<br />
should try to measure its size to compare against that reference.&nbsp; (One way to do that in photos is to put something of known size, like a coin, next to the <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> when you photograph it.)<br />
<br />
A second reference is<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/11644/bgpage">http://bugguide.net/node/view/<wbr></wbr>11644/bgpage</a><br />
<br />
which is the Bug Guide, which is hosted by Iowa State University Entomology. They have lots of pictures, as well as an identification service.&nbsp; Their photos match up with your photos so you're again probably confirming that identification.<br />
<br />
As to the question of danger from <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites, the Michigan DNR has a page on insects and spiders:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204---,00.html">http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,<wbr></wbr>1607,7-153-10370_12145_12204--<wbr></wbr>-,00.html</a><br />
<br />
which talks about the two known spiders of medical importance in Michigan, the Northern Black Widow and the Brown Recluse.&nbsp; Since it's not one of those, you shouldn't worry about it being dangerous.&nbsp; In fact I searched google for the phrase<br />
<br />
&quot;<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> <span class="nfakPe">spider</span> bites&quot;<br />
<br />
and got no hits.&nbsp; You might find this search interesting too:<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=pumpkin+spider&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">http://www.google.com/trends?<wbr></wbr>q=<span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span>+<span class="nfakPe">spider</span>&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=<wbr></wbr>all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0</a><br />
<br />
which shows that people look for <span class="nfakPe">pumpkin</span> spiders this time of year!</p>

I&rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place
in the time between the Solstices &amp; Equinoxes and their following
new moons. Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas
and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&rsquo;t
buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that
you have enough.</p></blockquote><p>This weekend&rsquo;s project is emptying out bits of the garage that have accumulated reusable leftovers from the summer&rsquo;s kitchen project.&nbsp; We took a couple of windows to the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Reuse_Center">Reuse Center on S.

<p>In thinking about how to identify the things that need to go, I'm back to notes I wrote about seiri.&nbsp; The approach here is to use red tags to identify things that don't belong, and then to systematically remove the things that don't belong so that no red tags are left and no new red tags appear.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/48871860/">The most interesting thing I've written about seiri </a>was written on paper, so you can see the scan.&nbsp; I want to go back and do the red tag thing online in some clever way.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-25-storage-density/">Storage density in petabytes per shipping container</a>
      </h3>
      <p>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&nbsp; I'm looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you'd get in &quot;petabytes per container&quot;.</p>

<p>The answer appears to be &quot;about one petabyte per six linear feet of container&quot;, or put another way, &quot;about one petabyte per ten cubic meters of containerized storage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/web/petabox.php">The Internet Archive's Petabox design specs:</a> included requirements to run in a shipping container.</p>

<p>How big is a shipping container? <a href="http://blog.managednetworks.co.uk/it-support/googles-20-petabytes/"> If a grain of rice is one byte, a shipping container can hold a half a gigabyte,</a> and a petabyte covers central London in a meter of rice.&nbsp; So, a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,278,273.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,278,273&amp;RS=PN/7,278,273">Google's patent <strong>7,278,273 </strong>covers a modular data center:</a></p><blockquote><p>Modular data centers with modular components suitable for use with rack or
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; shelf mount computing systems, for example, are disclosed. The modular
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; center generally includes a modular computing module including an
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; intermodal shipping container and computing systems mounted within the
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; container and configured to be shipped and operated within the container
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and a temperature control system for maintaining the air temperature
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; surrounding the computing systems. The intermodal shipping container may
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; be configured in accordance to International Organization for
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Standardization (ISO) container manufacturing standards or otherwise
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; configured with respect to height, length, width, weight, and/or lifting
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; points of the container for transport via an intermodal transport
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; infrastructure. The modular design enables the modules to be cost
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; effectively built at a factory and easily transported to and deployed at
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a data center site.
</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/perspectives.jsp">Sun built something called Project Black Box, now called the Sun Modular Datacenter; </a>they are selling it to organizations that have maxed out their existing data centers or who need on site computing before the rest of a facility under construction is built.&nbsp; It specs out at 3 petabytes per 20 foot container.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rackable.com/products/icecube.aspx">Rackable Systems has the ICECube, at 7.1 petabytes per 40 foot container:</a></p><blockquote><p>Rackable Systems’ award-winning ICE Cube™ data center solution delivers 
extreme server and storage density in a self-contained, fully portable 20’ 
or 40’ container. Its advanced cooling design dramatically cuts ongoing 
operational expenses as does its easy serviceability. First deployed in March, 
2007, the latest generation ICE Cube more than doubles the maximum density to 
2800 independent servers per container—for up to 22,400 cores in a 40' x 
8' container. For storage-focused deployments, the ICE Cube is capable of housing 
up to 7.1 Petabytes of data. Designed to augment or replace traditional brick-and-mortar 
data centers of any size, these high densities are achieved while offering a broader 
choice of container sizes and configurability of Rackable Systems’ Eco-Logical™ 
servers and storage.</p></blockquote><p>The best researchy piece I found on this is from <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/01/11/microsoft-confirms-data-center-in-a-box/">Chuck Thacker of Microsoft Research, via a piece in Data Center Knowledge in January 2008 </a></p><blockquote><p>In October Thacker gave a presentation at the Stanford Networking Seminar titled “Rethinking Data Centers” (available in <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/seminars/10_25_07.ppt">PowerPoint</a>)
that examined various approaches to “data center in a box” approach to
portable data centers. Thacker’s slides describe an approach using
40-foot containerized data centers packed with 32 energy-efficient
racks, each filled with 40 1U servers. Using 64 of those containers
would result in a data center facility filled with 82,000 servers and
using 16 megawatts of power.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://netseminar.stanford.edu/">Stanford Networking Seminar </a>schedule shows a bunch of interesting talks, some with slides, almost all with speaker bios, recommended.&nbsp; Here's the description of this talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Microsoft builds several data centers each year, with each center containing in excess of fifty thousand servers.&nbsp; This is 
quite expensive, and we'd like to reduce the capital and operating expenses for these centers.</p>

<p>
This talk suggests that an effective way to do this is to treat the data center as a system, rather than focusing on the 
individual components such as networking and servers.&nbsp; I'll describe one way this could work, with a particular focus on the 
networking infrastructure. </p></blockquote>
