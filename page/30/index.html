<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager.html" target="_self">I wrote an early review of Contactually</a>, and I signed up for their pro service after the trial period expired. I used the system for a couple of months, but have decided to back down from the pro version back to the free version for a while. Here are some reasons for that.</p>

<p>First and perhaps foremost, Contactually is relatively expensive at $20/mo. I looked at what I was spending (or not spending) on other internet services that I use and like. I don&#39;t have a Flickr Pro account, but I used to, and I could get a year of service for less than two months of Contactually. Similarly I could renew another year of Pinboard pro service for less than two months of Contactually. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s expensive in absolute terms, but relative to other things I want to spend money on online, it looks spendy.</p>

<p>Second - and this is as much of a criticism of my habits than of Contactually - I never really managed to get it to systematically unearth new people to contact that had fallen off my radar. Rather than provide an ever-changing set of new folks to prod me to reconnect with, it seemed to recommend the same people over and over. That was useful at first to be mindful of people a second time if I had passed them by the first time, but the net result was that there were fewer people than I expected that Contactually re-introduced me to.</p>

<p>I have an Android phone, and Contactually doesn&#39;t yet have an Android app. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a deal breaker, but I&#39;m hoping that they come out with something that&#39;s awesome - and I&#39;m willing to re-up for pro service again in order to try it out if that&#39;s what it takes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still unhappy overall with the state of Android contact managers. I would have thought that everyone ever designing a contact manager would have an updatable field for &quot;last contact date&quot; that had some kind of easy to view screens to see how you&#39;re doing, and that would be smart about noticing phone calls, emails, text messages, and meetings from your calendar. Hey, you could do that even on paper rolodex cards! Contact management basics need to be better across the board so that your phone can prompt you on who to call next, a sort of predictive dialer for your life.</p>

Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age?</p>
<p>One approach is the &quot;virtual bookplate&quot;, described in <a href="http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/419.full" target="_self">this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida</a>. The catalog is extended to include graphics that honor the donor of the materials, and the search is extended to make it easy to look up all of the works that were donated by a particular individual. The story goes that a donor was so impressed at how easy it was to see a pretty view of what they had given to the library that they wrote a check on the spot to donate more.</p>
<p>Another perspective on this is the &quot;virtual collection of bookplates&quot;. The one of these that I&#39;ve found is the&#0160;<a href="http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/exlibris/" target="_self">John Starr Stewart Ex Libris Collection</a>&#0160;at the University of Illinois, with over 1500 plates collected between 1903 and 1906. The University of Michigan plate in this post is from that collection.&#0160;</p>

<blockquote>“Learning about Internet culture is like learning a new language. Immersion is the most important approach – but immersion in cyberspace has its seductive side. There is always something new: there are new developments related to the Internet, whether technological, social, cultural, or political. Studying the Internet did indeed feel like shooting a moving target. …<strong>To be sure, the Internet changes daily.</strong> But that does not mean what happened yesterday is meaningless today, for every little development in the past becomes part of the present. …Seen in this way, no research of the Internet can be outdated.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, it&#39;s apparent that search and social infrastructure (Google and Twitter) now play a key role in re-spawning content that gets blocked in any one place, and drawing even more attention to the surviving copies. If suppressed content automatically goes viral, the Internet&#39;s construction basically guarantees that that content will have a home for the rest of time. If you attack DNS support, people will tweet raw IP addresses. If you take down the BGP routes to web content, people will put up more mirrors, or switch to overlay networks to distribute the data.

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time there was a Journal of Irreproducable Results, which published science humor. It started in 1955, says Wikipedia, and saw a schism in 1995 that led to the founding of the Annals of Improbable Research. AIR is noted for its awarding of the prestigous Ig Nobel awards, rewarding achievements that&#0160;&quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;.</p>
<p>Now the august journal Nature is getting into the fray, with an entire special issue on <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/index.html" target="_self">Challenges in Irreproducable Research</a>. They describe it thusly:</p>
<blockquote>No research paper can ever be considered to be the final word, and the replication and corroboration of research results is key to the scientific process. In studying complex entities, especially animals and human beings, the complexity of the system and of the techniques can all too easily lead to results that seem robust in the lab, and valid to editors and referees of journals, but which do not stand the test of further studies. Nature has published a series of articles about the worrying extent to which research results have been found wanting in this respect.
</blockquote>
<p>For more sources of irreproducable conclusions, a very good source is
the <a href="http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/">Retraction Watch weblog</a> which tracks scientific fraud through watching for retractions of published papers. Now not every irreproducable result is the result of fraud - sloppy mistakes and bad data handling are in part to blame, as are difficult to replicate experimental conditions. Retraction Watch also covers garden-variety scientific fraud like plagiarism and the sin of submitting a single paper to more than one journal.</p>

We did one other thing. We arranged all the attributes in alphabetical order, and then 
used a random number generator to select (without replacement) either 10 or 15 attributes 
from among them and then replicated this experiment a number of times. Here are the 
 results for one particular replication of the experiment for truly hypothetical wines.
</p>
<p><em>Château La Merde, 1995. Packed and tight, with oily, smoked game and petrol, yet 
with reﬁned fruit, a hint of black fruit and olive ﬂavors and aromas, and supported 
by meaty fruit, undergrowth and lush tannins running through the lengthy ﬁnish. 
Best from 2007 through 2025, Inky, with olive-tinged black currants, blackberries, 
tobacco and delicious vegetable ﬂavors.

      <p>From Systemantics, the systems bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While Systems-people share certain attributes in common, each specific system tends to attract people with specific sets of attributes. For example, people who are attracted to auto racing are likely to be people who enjoy driving fast, tinkering with high-powered cars, and beating other people in fierce competition. The System calls forth those attributes in its members and rewards the extreme degrees of them. But a word of warning is in order.&nbsp;<em>A priori</em>&nbsp;guesses as to what traits are fostered by a given system are likely to be wrong. Furthermore, those traits are not necessarily conducive to successful operation of the System itself, e.g., the qualities necessary for being elected president do not include the ability to run the country.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Systems attract not only Systems-people who have attributes for success&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;the system. They also attract individuals who possess specialized attributes adapted to allow them to thrive at the expense of the system, i.e., persons who&nbsp;<em>parasitize</em>&nbsp;them. As the barnacle attaches to the whale, these persons attach themselves to systems, getting a free ride and a free lunch as long as the system survives.</p>

      <p>Press release from the City of Ann Arbor</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>E. Stadium Bridges Dedication Ceremony is Tuesday, May 14, 10 a.m.</p>

<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 11, 2013 — A brief dedication ceremony for the City of Ann Arbor’s E. Stadium Bridges Replacement Project will be held at 10 a.m., Tuesday, May 14, 2013 near 1501 S. State Street, next to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street. Congressman John Dingell will be joined with representatives from the national Department of Transportation, as well as officials from MDOT, Washtenaw County, City of Ann Arbor, project contractors, neighbors, and the general public. Temporary public parking will be available on the UM Red Lot adjacent to the bridge over S. State Street.</p>

<p>Within 12 months, the E. Stadium Bridges Reconstruction Project built two new bridges, on-street bike lanes, a new sidewalk on the south side--and a widened sidewalk along the north side--of E. Stadium Boulevard, a new sidewalk along the west side of S. State Street with a signalized pedestrian crossing of the railroad tracks, two staircases connecting E. Stadium Boulevard to S. State Street, ADA-compliant facilities with an accessible path between S. State Street and E. Stadium Boulevard, storm water quality<br />
improvements, new water mains, improvements to Rose-White Park, landscaping, and many other features.</p>

<p>The City of Ann Arbor received funding from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for $13.9 million in TIGER II Discretionary Grant Funding, and about $1.67 million and $1.20 million, respectively, in Local Bridge Program and Transportation Enhancement Funding. All told, the City received about $16.8 million (or about 73 percent of the total estimated project costs) in state and federal funds to complete the project. The remaining 27 percent of the project was funded via various city sources including the Ann Arbor voter-approved Street and Bridge Resurfacing & Reconstruction Millage as the required local-match for the grants. Public notifications of developments in the E. Stadium Bridges project have been posted at www.annarborbridges.org.</p>

<p>The previous E. Stadium Bridges were built in 1928. The bridges carry more than 24,000 vehicles per day.</p>

It&#39;s OK to say which county you located the morels in, but don&#39;t narrow it down any more than that. I happen to know that morels can be found in Marquette County, but even my mom won&#39;t always provide an exact location.</p>
<p>With this mapping in mind, here&#39;s a few sources for early morel sightings in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michigan-Morels/261288532041" target="_self">Michigan Morels</a> has daily reports with photos of people showing off the results of their hunt. No maps, but lots of county reports.</p>
<p>MorelHunters.com (&quot;Where the hunters gather&quot;) has a <a href="http://morelhunters.com/" target="_self">morel progression map</a> on their front page. The Michigan bit of it is included below, as of 1 May 2013.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I do a lot of writing in vim these days, in part because my fingers already know how to make words move around on the page. I find it easier to do the work in a place where I can rely on muscle memory for routine changes rather than have to laboriously guide the mouse around to do edits.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was an outlining tool called MaxThink (it still exists, for Windows only) that applied the same kind of keyboard-heavy work to outline editing. MaxThink is unique as far as I know in that in addition to the typical kind of outline commands it also had powerful operations like &quot;bin sort&quot; that operated on the outline as a whole. If you had learned the system (and it was non-trivial to learn) you could re-sort a collection of headings faster than you could pick up any one of them with a mouse.</p>
<p>If you can get to the point where your fingers know how to get the desired results onto the page, writing and editing can be very quick. I&#39;ll admit to only learning a working subset of vim - there are lots of commands that I never use - but the ones that I do have in my brain really don&#39;t require thinking to take on.</p>

A diligent editor created a category of &quot;American women novelists&quot; and began adding female novelists to it, and then removing them from the category &quot;American novelists&quot;. A predictable hue and cry ensued. James Gleick tells the story in some detail in the NY Review of Books, under the title &quot;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/29/wikipedia-women-problem/" target="_self">Wikipedia&#39;s Women Problem</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>Categorization is hard in a Wikipedia world. The namespace for articles is flat, so there&#39;s no implicit categories assigned simply by what a page is named. On the other hand, categories can contain subcategories, and the Wikipedia editors take advantage of this to create elaborate categorical structures. Everything is part of something else, in some extended rhetorical tangle. (The image is from the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization" target="_self">Wikipedia:Categorization</a>.)</p>
<p>Categories don&#39;t have to have subcategories, of course; that&#39;s a convention that&#39;s not universal to all wiki software. Localwiki&#39;s equivalent structure looks more like tags, and tags are in one big flat namespace with no explicit hierarchy.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the choice is how to best improve findability of articles, and how to incorporate a distinctive feel to a system. Wikipedia has &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Doughnuts" target="_self">Category:Doughnuts</a>&quot;, with one subcategory &quot;Doughnut shops&quot; which in turn has a subcategory &quot;Tim Hortons&quot; which in turn has 12 pages, including Timbits. Arborwiki has a page <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Donuts" target="_self">Donuts</a>, which includes pages tagged with the tag &quot;donuts&quot;, and is in turn tagged as &quot;Pastries that are not strange&quot;. (And yes, there is a &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/tags/pastriesthatarestrange" target="_self">Pastries that are strange</a>&quot; tag as well.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a problem when the technically correct task of splitting a big category into smaller parts runs smack into the political minefield of deciding which part of the category is to be primary and which is to be secondary. No one wants to be secondary, and no reasonable system would always yield category warring. Perhaps Wikipedia has bumped up against some size limit where it&#39;s impossible for any one person to understand the complexity of the classification system it has built.</p>

<p><strong>About Arborwiki</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who: </strong>More than a dozen core contributors over the lifespan of the project, plus many more who have made small edits to pages.</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Greater Ann Arbor - including Washtenaw County and the farmers who come to the Farmers Market from surrounding counties.</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>: Started in September 2005 as a class project at Community High School, then moved to servers at the Ann Arbor District Library.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>: About 10,000 pages, including the most popular <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Birthday Deals</a>, <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Volunteer_Opportunities" target="_self">Volunteer Opportunities</a>, and perennial favorite <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Donuts" target="_self">Donuts</a> and <a href="http://arborwiki.org/paczki" target="_self">Paczki</a> pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: To build community information about the Ann Arbor area.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding principles</strong></p>
<p>Locality, not notability, is the main criterion for relevance; if it&#39;s here, then it&#39;s relevant.</p>
<p>Take a local point of view, not a neutral point of view; original text and personal views welcomed.</p>
<p>Lots of external links to reference sources.</p>
<p><strong>State of the project</strong></p>
<p>Arborwiki is a mature system - it has over 10,000 pages in it, and thus there&#39;s likely to be something about most things that people might look for that are relevant to the Ann Arbor area.</p>
<p>One advantage to maturity is that a lot of people know about the project through a popular &quot;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals" target="_self">Birthday Deals</a>&quot; page, and we don&#39;t have to explain in the abstract what we&#39;re working on - that individual page gets about two hundred visits per day.</p>
<p>A second advantage is that we&#39;ve gotten tremendous amounts of cooperation from the <a href="http://aadl.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor District Library</a> system, including help with research, links, technical support, and free hosting for this community project.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges of a mature system</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s no &quot;new wiki&quot; smell, and we can&#39;t count on having a barn-raising strategy for people who want to document their community for the first time. Any enthusiasm has to be in the context of a lot of things that already exist.</p>
<p>The core of regular contributors is relatively small compared to the number of pages in the system. It would take 30+ page edits per day of existing pages just to get enough eyes on the older parts of Arborwiki just to keep each page refreshed to be less than a year since its latest edit.</p>
<p>There are too many short, uninformative pages with just a single bare link and no photo, no map, no template etc. One editor - and that would be me - went through a long period of emphasizing quantity over quality. Now that the quantity is there, it&#39;s time to focus on quality.</p>
<p>The site needs more photos and better support from photographers.</p>
<p><strong>The Ypsiwiki problem</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a separate <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ypsiwiki" target="_self">Ypsiwiki</a> which covered Ypsilanti. It was decided to merge those pages in because there was too much project overlap and not quite enough of a critical mass to keep the two systems separate. The Arborwiki name was retained, and as a result, there&#39;s resistance overall from contributors from Ypsilanti to contribute to a project that&#39;s not theirs.</p>
<p><strong>What to do next</strong></p>
<p>Improve the most popular pages on the site. Use Google Analytics to identify the pages that get the most traffic, and go through them page by page to ensure that they are up to date, correct, accurate, and informative.</p>
<p>Create new pages based on a &quot;Page not found&quot; report from Google Analytics, noting where people click on terms that get them to a blank or empty page.</p>
<p>Visit a random page in the site and make it better. Add a map, a photograph, a category, or a paragraph of information.</p>
<p>Learn the seasonal rhythms of the site. For example, the Paczki page gets traffic for about a week a year, but the Donuts page gets steady traffic year round.</p>
<p>Follow public meetings like the meetings of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Ann_Arbor_City_Council" target="_self">Ann Arbor City Council</a>, and tweet out links to projects or issues that are relevant agenda items.</p>
<p>Wish someone a happy birthday by sending them a link to the Birthday Deals page on Facebook.</p>
<p>Reward new contributors by recognizing them in public through Facebook or Twitter links to their new contributions.</p>
<p>Recognize that a Localwiki project has a natural size, and identify where you are in the process.</p>
<p>Pay attention to traffic patterns - popular pages, referral sites, keywords used.</p>
<p>If you want traffic, track the news, and befriend local media so that they are aware of the resource.</p>

<p>For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.</p>
<p>I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them. A good, tidy, modern blog that is comprehensive in some narrow sphere would have a tidy list of categories and would post in each of them regularly enough to be helpful. In contrast, a laundry list of one-time enthusiams just makes it pointedly clear when my interests have waxed and waned.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Typepad doesn&rsquo;t have a straightforward way to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; a blog post to the top of a category, the same way that it can mark a post to stay on top of the main page. That makes it trickier to create permanent navigation within a category.</p>
<p>I do hope to put together some better navigation, so that someone coming to the blog for the first time can read some more popular posts or ones that I like. The whole thing has long since gone from a narrow, coherent narrative and turned into an unpolished open notebook, gathering scraps from here and there and not always pieces that have an obvious relation to the work as a whole. If it were a real scrapbook it would have tape-tags sticking out of it at all angles in all colors flagging things that deserve to be seen again; that doesn&rsquo;t have to be done with categories.</p></p>

No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&#39;m working on upper right.</p>
<p>The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little hurt by making the sidebars full of white space, but not much. My paper notebooks have lots of marginalia, but they are marginalia that change with every page, and a lot of it is sidebar note-to-self rather than publishable anything. Still, the pages load <strong><em>a lot faster</em></strong> when they don&#39;t have quite so much crap on them, and I haven&#39;t even started to explore adding more stuff at the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typepad.com" target="_self">Typepad</a> is particularly good as a place to play with designs, they have a lot of premade ones that look much better than anything I would cobble together on my own (see e.g. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html" target="_self">this early effort</a> which I wrote in vi, which is probably where I&#39;d start from if left to my own devices).</p>
<p>Pages load a lot faster. Zoom! And that alone is worthwhile to do a redesign for.</p>
