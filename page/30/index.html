<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>My first reaction to the horrible events of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t look at pictures, especially not the graphic ones. There isn&#39;t time to react.</li>
<li>Focus on something small, like a neighbor who was running the marathon who is ok.</li>

<p> 
Now that the taxes are done, do the other paperwork you’ve been putting off! 
</p>
<p>
National Healthcare Decisions Day highlights the importance of advance healthcare decision-making.  As a participating organization, After Death Home Care is providing information and tools for the public to talk about their wishes with family, friends and healthcare providers, and execute written advance directives in accordance with Michigan laws.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, on April 16, from 6:30 – 8:30 pm, After Death Home Care is welcoming the public with information about advance care planning and advance directive forms. Merilynne Rush, RN, Natural Burial Specialist is joined by Patricia Lyndale, UM Hospital Chaplain, and John Erdevig, Attorney, to answer questions.
</p>
<p> 
National Healthcare Decisions Day encourages people in our community to have thoughtful conversations about their healthcare decisions and to complete reliable advance directives to make their wishes known.  As a result, more people will plan ahead before a health crisis, fewer families and healthcare providers will have to struggle with making difficult decisions when a patient can no longer do so, and more families will be able to honor their loved ones wishes.

<hr />
<p>April 11, 2013</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues and AAPS Families:
</p>
<p>Last evening, I gave President Deb Mexicotte a letter in which I asked her to 
accept my resignation as Superintendent of Schools of the Ann Arbor Public 
Schools, effective 90 days from yesterday. I shared with her that I plan to 
retire during the summer after 43 years as a professional educator in public 
education. I have been blessed to have truly enjoyed my 43-year career and I 
thanked her and the Board for the opportunity to serve the Ann Arbor 
community during these past two years.
</p>
<p>To all my colleagues in Ann Arbor Public Schools, it has been a privilege to 
work with you and I wish you well as you continue to maintain the highest 
of standards for all of our children in the future. Ann Arbor is truly an 
outstanding school district with so many dedicated staff members who care 
enormously about children. Your commitment and dedication are beyond 
compare! 
</p>
<p>As I retire, I hope to do some reflective writing about my many experiences 
in education, do some traveling, and reconnect with family and friends who I 
have neglected over the years!
</p>
<p>Thank you to you all!
</p>
<p>Patricia P. Green, Ph.D.
</p>
<p>Superintendent of Schools
</p>
<p>Ann Arbor Public Schools</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to have a chance to keep working on this, since even the smallest amount of money from new sales covers the direct costs &#0160;of coffee to do the writing.</p>
<p>Release Notes
</p>
<blockquote>April 9, 2013.<br /><br />This release updates the first 7 chapters of the book plus the introduction. Most of the changes are to fill in gaps, small reorganizations of the text, and line edits; there&#39;s not a ton of new original materials. Chapters 8 through to the end are unchanged.<br /><br />One of the things that&#39;s new in the Michigan FOIA world is that Muckrock (Appendix A) now supports FOIA requests to a number of Ann Arbor cities. My first trial with this worked a little bit well, and I&#39;m going to keep trying to improve how that system works so that I get the best writeup of it.<br /><br />A document trove from a recent FOIA request is a log of all FOIA requests to the City of Ann Arbor over the span of two months. Look for a future set of edits to expand the &quot;sample requests&quot; considerably based on that collection, since I&#39;m still digesting them.<br /><br />If anyone has tried the &quot;send to Kindle&quot; feature, let me know how it went.<br /><br />As always, if you have any questions, contact me at&#0160;<a href="mailto:edward.vielmetti@gmail.com" target="_blank">edward.vielmetti@gmail.com</a>&#0160;or&#0160;<a href="tel:%2B1%20734%20330%202465" target="_blank">+1 734 330 2465</a>.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Ed</blockquote></p>

      <p>A lovely day for a foolish parade. We were out and got some choice standing places in the springtime sunshine, and when the parade got to be too much for the youngest of the party, we went out for hot chocolate and a muffin.</p>

<p>According to Ken Campbell, North Quad’s maintenance mechanic, a broken joint pipe on the building’s fire suppression system was responsible for the flooding. The break occurred in the East Stairwell on the fourth floor of the building, he said. When the pipe lost pressure, the system automatically turned the water pump on to add pressure, exacerbating the flow from the three-inch pipe.</p>
<p>Campbell estimated that “thousands and thousands” of gallons poured from the pipe before it was turned off 20 minutes later.</p>

Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network.</p>
<p>It's OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts.</p>

<p>How will lunch work on Thursday at a new place? (A2B3 lost its regular restaurant, Eastern Accents, and we're meeting at Conor O'Neill's instead.) Caroline is manager.</p>
<p>What do you want to have stored up so that you can respond quickly to something new after having already thought through it at leisure?</p>
<p>How important is the drawing? (Very.)</p>
<p>Can you focus on something long enough to make it worthwhile to construct a lengthy effort to assemble media to support it?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Do I understand this? No. But this is a blog called Vacuum, and this is my service to that task.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values. As a result, the inherent characteristics of vacuum, like the speed of light, may not be a constant after all, but fluctuate. Meanwhile, in another study, Gerd Leuchs and Luis L. Sánchez-Soto, from the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Light in Erlangen, Germany, suggest that physical constants, such as the speed of light and the so-called impedance of free space, are indications of the total number of elementary particles in nature.&#0160;<br /><br />Read more at:&#0160;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-03-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-speed-of-light-fluctuations.html#jCp">http://phys.org/news/2013-03-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-speed-of-light-fluctuations.html#jCp</a></p>

      <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage.html" target="_self">OneTab</a> to help manage things.</p>
<p>The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down.</p>
<p>The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">pinboard</a> that tab) and then close it out. When I&#39;m done, there will be no open tabs, and everything will have moved forward just a little bit.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If you, like me, are interested in how systems work and when they fail, here are three good sources to look at from the internet persective on global network behavior.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages" target="_self">outages mailing list</a> (outages at outages.org) describes itself as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary goal of this mailing list (&quot;outages&quot;) is for outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns. Some also believe that LEC&#39;s and IXC&#39;s also like this model as they no longer have to air their dirty laundry. Then again, this mailing list is not about making anyone look bad, its all about information sharing and keeping network operators &amp; end users abreast on the situation as close to real-time information as possible in order to assess and respond to major outage such as routing voice/data via different carriers which may directly or indirectly impact us and our customers. A reliable communications network is essential in times of crisis.&#0160;<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s always good information about bad news to be found here, with a typical exchange being &quot;I lost some circuits to city X&quot; and the reply &quot;Company Y has a fiber cut in city Z&quot;.&#0160;</p>
<p>A second excellent source of global routing information about failures and reconfigurations of the global internet is the weblog that&#39;s written by the company Renesys. The <a href="http://renesys.com/blog/" target="_self">Renesys Blog</a>&#0160;has as of this writing details about network connectivity problems to North and South Korea, a fiber cut in the Black Sea that disrupted traffic as far away as Oman (3000+ km away), and details of a submarine cable landing in Cuba.&#0160;</p>
<p>Finally - though there is not really a finally in this world where part of the Internet is always under repair - there is a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/115136140203018391796" target="_self">&quot;Postmortems&quot; discussion group on Google Plus</a> where reports come in after the fact of people describing just what went wrong with their complex system and (usually) what they plan to do next to avoid the next round of similar failures. From squirrel-induced cascading power failures to denial of service attacks to runaway email systems, there&#39;s a new lesson to be learned from each after-action review of failure.</p>
<p>All of these groups overlap somewhat with the <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/" target="_self">RISKS Digest</a>, one of the oldest mailing lists still around on the internet, that covers risks to the public from computing technology.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Grand_Traverse_Pie_Company" target="_self">linked</a>) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly.</p>
<p>The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. I've written before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/pocket-twitter-a-suitable-replacement-for-the-internet-when-offline.html" target="_self">Pocket Twitter</a>; there's also a very effective <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html" target="_self">Pocket Issue Tracker</a> where you write down things to do and then re-sync them with your online issue tracker once you are online again.</p>
<p>There is technology that will help this state of interrupted connectivity, and I use it when I can. Of all of the applications that I use, <a href="http://mail.google.com" target="_self">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_self">Evernote</a> are the two that have the best developed clients that can intelligently buffer things when you're offline. If I have my laptop and no connectivity, I can also use "git" and "vim" to work on my writing projects, knowing that a "git push origin master" command will resync when I'm ready to update changes.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was no internet and every application worked well offline. Netnews was delivered one batch at a time, and you'd read it while the modem was quiet; email, if it was important enough, might warrant a long distance call to deliver. Now, when the net is down or flaky you should still be able to get work done. And yes, I should really get a data plan for my new phone so that I don't have to rely on the quality of random coffee shops for personal productivity.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time.</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://mysleepbot.com/" target="_self">SleepBot</a> (http://mysleepbot.com/) and <a href="http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/" target="_self">SleepTime</a> (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone's accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you're not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed.</p>
<p>I haven't used SleepTime yet, but SleepBot seemed to work this morning. That is to say, it did wake me up at 7:00 alert enough to notice that I was awake, but since I didn't have anything else planned for that early hour I caught some more sleep.</p>
<p>The only hitch I really see is that overnight is when I like to charge the phone, and by keeping the phone under the pillow it gets in the way of starting the next day with a full battery.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to hear any reviews or recommendations from anyone who's tried these over a longer period of time. I have a faint goal of getting to bed earlier and getting up earlier, and if this can be accomplished with the help of a tiny habit to put my phone under my pillow before bedtime, let's try that out and see what works.</p>

      <p>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it.</p>
<p>The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun. At some level of thrashing, the chance of an out-and-out crash gets higher, and then I&#39;m suddenly looking at a blank screen.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.one-tab.com/" target="_self">OneTab</a>&#0160;(<a href="http://www.one-tab.com/" target="_self">http://www.one-tab.com/)</a>, a Chrome extension that corrals your tabs by doing something fairly straightforward. Rather than keeping hidden tabs open, it suspends the tabs you&#39;re not using, freeing up system memory. Restoring a tab set isn&#39;t that hard and isn&#39;t that slow, and the ones you do have open go faster. In my admittedly brief experience with it, I&#39;ve managed to avoid having the system start to page, and the tabs that would otherwise chew through memory in the background (looking at you, Google Analytics) get stuck aside for later review.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not the only one who found this and liked it - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/eby" target="_self">Ryan Eby (@eby)</a>&#0160;for the link, after I complained about a Chrome crash.</p>
