<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedgeree" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Kedgeree">Kedgeree</a> - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water</li>
<li>safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it</li>
<li>spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar</li>
<li>vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>salt, pepper</li>
<li>fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon</li>
<li>greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch</li>
<li>hard boiled eggs for garnish</li>
</ul>
<p>The method runs roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Cook the rice first; if you happen to have enough leftover rice, you can use that.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large pan, and saute the onion (and possibly garlic) for 3-5 minutes until soft. Add the spices which will give the onions a wonderful color and smell when thoroughly mixed.</p>
<p>Mix in the vegetables so that they are heated through or cooked; again, suitably prepared leftovers would work here.</p>
<p>Add the rice to the onion mixture, stirring well. Add lemon juice.</p>
<p>Flake the fish and mix in with the rice. Mix in chopped parsley or cilantro. Stir well, and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with hard boiled eggs if desired.</p>
<p>- end -</p>
<p>Some deviations from this basic approach are useful.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&#39;s going on in real time. This is helped by the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/05/ann-arbor-city-council-meetings-now-simulcast-online.html" target="_self">live simulcast of Ann Arbor City Council meetings on CTN</a>, the city&#39;s cable access television feed, as well as online.</p>
<p>There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary. To help follow this, Twitter had adopted the #aacitycouncil hash tag to follow along. Last night, though, AnnArbor.com reporter Ryan Stanton had this great suggestion:</p>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton"><strong>Ryan J. Stanton</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>ryanjstanton</strong></a></div>

<div>Note that #a2council is shorter, just as informative, and unambiguous - and thus the universal decision that followed to change the use of one tag for another.</div>

      </h3>
      <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.</p>
<p>The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either).</p>
<p>The blog Brandland USA did this <a href="http://www.brandlandusa.com/2008/07/02/were-lovin-remastered-casey-kasem-at-40/">2008 piece on the revival of American Top 40</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Yes, you can still catch Casey Kasem’s original 1970s American Top 40 radio shows on your local FM. The shows have returned from a tape morgue in Hollywood, and have been completely remastered. They were remastered by “syndicated radio junkies” at the Cabot, Arkansas based audio restoration firm Charis Music Group. Charis has posted original “Cue sheets” on its website so nostalgia junkies like us can read along with the shows.</blockquote>
<p>And with that hint, I was able to search enough to find this set listing on <a href="http://staxofwaxtopofthepops.blogspot.com/2012/07/casey-kasems-at40-80s-july-7th-2012.html" target="_self">Stax of Wax</a>, the precise music played 30 years ago on the July 4 weekend show in 1982.&#0160;</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR (June 29, 2012) An intense storm called a derecho with long lived straight line winds passed to the south of the area today. The <a href="http://disastermapping.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/6292012-derecho-long-lived-wind-event/" target="_self">Disaster Mapping weblog entry 6/29/2012 Derecho</a> has a good summary of the impact to the power grid from storm, which had knocked out power to over 3 million people as of 11:45 p.m from Illinois all the way to DC. Wind gusts of over 90 miles per hour were clocked in some areas as the storm blew through.

<blockquote>
<p>June 26, 2012 — The University of Virginia&#0160;<strong><a href="http://www.virginia.edu/bov">Board of Visitors&#0160;</a></strong>today voted unanimously to reinstate Teresa A. Sullivan as president.</p>
<p>University Rector Helen E. Dragas apologized for actions that sparked the controversy and pledged that she will work with Sullivan to capture the energy from the events of the past three weeks to address the issues confronting the University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Virginia Libraries is documenting this turn in the power struggle at UVA, which saw Sullivan ousted from her post by the Board of Visitors. From the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/uva-creates-archive-documenting-sullivans-resignation/37295" target="_self">Chronicle of Higher Education</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of Virginia library staff is archiving materials related to the recent events&#0160;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Teresa-Sullivan-Resigns-From/132417/">that forced Teresa A. Sullivan to resign</a>&#0160;as president of the institution.</p>
<p>This is the first time the libraries have tried to preserve materials from a large-scale, continuing event, said Bradley Daigle, director of digital-curation services. The staff did not begin collecting materials on the subject until a rally on June 18. As of June 22, the team has archived nearly 20,000 tweets, 61 blog posts, over 200 media posts, and about 100 physical objects, such as signs from protests.</p>

<p>As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide.</p>
<p>Quite a few positions are filled without going through online job boards, of course - but it never hurts to see what&#39;s posted and available.</p>

      <p>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.</p>
<blockquote>&quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us. He could find out literally anything.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Facebook is asking me &quot;What&#39;s the best thing that&#39;s happened to you today?&quot; I&#39;m sure that this is not the only question that Facebook asks, based on other people&#39;s reports, but I haven&#39;t yet seen a comprehensive list of the prompts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p><a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/" target="_self">Global Tuners</a> is a worldwide project for people to share their shortwave radio receivers. There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Global-tuners-perth-australia" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef016306928ab3970d-500wi" alt="Global-tuners-perth-australia" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. That&rsquo;s been successful up to a point, but compared to the last time I was following this world (20 years ago) there&rsquo;s a lot less in the English language and more in Chinese. Getting access to tuners around the world, especially to ones that have better antenna setups than I do, is remarkably handy.</p>
<p>The other thing that you can use a shortwave set for most of the time is listening to AM and FM stations that are aimed at a local audience. Here is where some of the most unusual listening comes in - it&rsquo;s just plain fun to tune in an Australian FM station (via a tuner in Australia) and listen to what ordinary radio sounds like there.</p>
<p>For best results, you&rsquo;ll want to pair this with some lookup tools that help you figure out what&rsquo;s on the air at that time that&rsquo;s likely to be heard in that part of the world. <a href="http://short-wave.info" target="_self">Short-wave.info</a> has a nice real time database of broadcast schedules, so that if you are tuning around the dial on shortwave you can see which stations are likely to be broadcasting. &nbsp;<a href="http://fmscan.org/index.php" target="_self">FMSCAN</a> has global listings of AM and FM stations, and <a href="http://www.mwlist.org/ul_login.php?sprache=en" target="_self">MWLIST</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;longwave, mediumwave, tropical bands and a shortwave radio database. It&rsquo;s the kind of information that I recall from sorting through the back pages of the World Radio and TV Handbook, except that it&rsquo;s all linked together (and more up to date than my 1980s copy).</p>

      <p>When you notice <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/06/linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak.html" target="_self">a big LinkedIn password breach</a> one day, and then several other sites also announce problems in subsequent days, there seems to be a pattern worth noticing. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed of late.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-crypto-breakthrough/" target="_self">Flame virus uses a previously undiscovered attack on the MD5 cryptographic hash</a> in order to carry out some of its devious work.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flame is the first known example of an MD5 collision attack being used maliciously in a real-world environment. It wielded the esoteric technique to digitally sign malicious code with a fraudulent certificate that&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flame-malware-was-signed-by-rogue-microsoft-certificate/">appeared to originate with Microsoft</a>. By deploying fake servers on networks that hosted machines already infected by Flame—and using the certificates to sign Flame modules—the malware was able to&#0160;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/flames-god-mode-cheat-code-wielded-to-hijack-windows-7-server-2008/">hijack the Windows Update mechanism</a>&#0160;Microsoft uses to distribute patches to hundreds of millions of customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking over Windows Update is game over for a compromised system, and of course it&#39;s also an efficient way to keep your bugged system up to date with the latest bugs. Flame is thus suspected of being created by a powerful nation-state, since the crypto needed to do this is beyond the grasp of but a few skilled mathematicians.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bricklink.com" target="_self">Bricklink</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/messageThread.asp?ID=133899&amp;amp;nID=642624" target="_self">their admin user id was stolen</a>, and a number of accounts were fraudulently merged together. No word yet on how the attacker(s) got access to the key account on the system, and I haven&#39;t seen any other reporting about problems at this LEGO trading site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a few people noticed, a number of major accounts were merged fraudulently&#0160;around 12:15 pm EDT today. As a merge is almost impossible to undo, the solution&#0160;was to do a database rollback to 12:00 PM EDT today. This breach was due to the&#0160;Admin user ID being stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>TheNextWeb writes about <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/06/07/change-your-last-fm-password-now-there-may-have-been-another-security-breach/" target="_self">problems at last.fm which is reporting a big password leak</a> on the scale of LinkedIn. The <a href="http://www.last.fm/passwordsecurity" target="_self">last.fm notice</a> reads in part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently investigating the leak of some Last.fm user passwords. This follows recent password leaks on other sites, as well as information posted online. As a precautionary measure, we’re asking all our users to change their passwords immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Passwords are a weak link in many online systems, and password database security gets short shrift in some growing startups. Perhaps these two tweets from Pinboard&#39;s founder&#0160;Maciej Ceglowski are worth noting to round out the report.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>Proud to reassure my users that&#0160;<strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;passwords are not only hashed and salted, but pan-seared and dusted with a saffron quince reduction</div>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Pinboard"><strong>Pinboard</strong>&#0160;‏@<strong>Pinboard</strong></a><strong>&#0160;</strong>(rightly) exasperated security person asks me to admit that Pinboard uses bcrypt. But there is no known way to make a bcrypt tweet funny</div>

      </h3>
      <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!</p>
<p>I used the <a href="http://www.familyhandyman.com/DIY-Projects/Home-Repair/Appliance-Repair/how-to-repair-a-leaking-washing-machine/View-All" target="_self">Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine</a>&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. The repair was made with <a href="http://www.duckbrand.com/Products/diy-products/diy-specialties/self-fusing-repair-tape.aspx" target="_self">Duck Brand Wrap-Fix Tape</a>, a self-fusing silicone tape that says it&#39;s good to 100 PSI.&#0160;And <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Stadium_Hardware" target="_self">Stadium Hardware</a>&#0160;(Arborwiki link) is a marvelous store, with helpful folks and a seemingly infinite supply of parts for every hardware need.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s just hope the repair holds! The next step, if it doesn&#39;t, is to replace that hose entirely. Repair Clinic has <a href="http://www.repairclinic.com/GE-Washing-Machine-Hose-Tube-Or-Fittings-Parts?z=100" target="_self">about 70 different GE washing machine hose parts available</a>; I haven&#39;t yet identified the exact part.&#0160;</p>
<p>Please note that the repair for the high-pressure supply hose would be very different, as noted in the comment below. The Family Handyman guide referenced above suggests getting a metallic no-burst supply hose <a href="http://www.fluidmaster.com/washing-machine-connectors.html/" target="_self">similar to this one from Fluidmaster</a> to replace any worn, corroded, or leaky supply hoses. Supply lines run at much higher pressure than drain lines.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Change your LinkedIn password.</p>
<p>News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. LinkedIn, for its part, has promised to strengthen its internal controls and introduce a &quot;salt&quot; into its password storage system.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/" target="_self">An update from LinkedIn</a>&#0160;acknowledges the leak. The <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/06/technology/linkedin-password-hack/index.htm" target="_self">reporting from CNN</a> is unusually detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Countless passwords on the list contain the word &quot;linkedin.&quot; On a&#0160;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4073309">popular hacker forum</a>, many reported finding passwords such as &quot;linkedout,&quot; &quot;recruiter,&quot; &quot;googlerecruiter,&quot; &quot;toprecruiter,&quot; &quot;superrecruiter,&quot; &quot;humanresources&quot; and &quot;hiring.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leak was complicated by LinkedIn&#39;s use of SHA-1 as its encryption scheme for passwords without using a &quot;salt&quot; to improve password security. <a href="http://blog.agilebits.com/2012/06/06/a-salt-free-diet-is-bad-for-your-security/" target="_self">AgileBits has a good discussion of how salting works</a>, and why you should use it; in short, it adds a little more randomness to even bad passwords so that an attacker can&#39;t pre-compute the hashed stored passwords directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if Bot and Alice use the same password (and so have the same hash of their passwords) they don’t have to worry about each other. Who they need to worry about is Charlie the Cracker. Charlie may have spent months running software that picks passwords and generates the hashes of those passwords. He will store those millions of passwords and their hashes in a database called a “Rainbow Table.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without a rainbow table, modern password cracking hardware is mighty fast. How fast? <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2012/06/confirmed-linkedin-6mil-password-dump.html" target="_self">Robert Graham from Errata Security lays it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;How fast can hackers crack passwords? The answer &quot;2 billion per second&quot; using the Radeon HD 7970 (the latest top-of-the-line graphics processor). Each letter of a password has 100 combinations (UPPER, lower, d1g1ts, $ymbols). A 5 letter password therefore has&#0160;<tt>100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100</tt>&#0160;or 10 billion combinations, meaning it can be cracked in 5 seconds. A 6 letter password has 100 times that, or 500 seconds. A 7 letter password has 100 times that, or 50,000 seconds, or 13 hours. An 8 character password is roughly 57 days. A 9 character password is 100 times that, about 15 years. In other words, if your password was 7 letters, the hacker has already cracked it, but if it&#39;s 9 letters, it&#39;s too difficult to crack with brute force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, &quot;too difficult&quot; for one computer is not the same as &quot;too difficult&quot; for a network of computing resources. Thomas Roth in 2010 on <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/15/cracking-in-the-cloud-amazons-new-ec2-gpu-instances/" target="_self">Cracking Passwords in the Cloud</a>&#0160;on Amazon&#39;s EC2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the CUDA-Multiforce, I was able to crack all hashes from&#0160;<a href="http://stacksmashing.net/blogfiles/2010_11_15/sha1_hashes.txt">this</a>&#0160;file with a password length from 1-6 in only 49 Minutes (1 hour costs 2.10$ by the way.):</p>
<div>
<div>Compute done: Reference time 2950.1 seconds<br />Stepping rate: 249.2M MD4/s<br />Search rate: 3488.4M NTLM/s</div>
</div>
<p>This just shows one more time that SHA1 for password hashing is deprecated – You really don’t want to use it anymore! Instead, use something like scrypt or PBKDF2! Just imagine a whole cluster of these machines (which is now easily available to anybody thanks to Amazon) cracking passwords for you. Pretty comfortable, large-scale password cracking for everybody!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 6 character SHA-1 hashes would cost about $2 to crack in 2010 computer-dollars; 7 characters, $200; 8 characters, $20,000; and 9 characters, &quot;only&quot; $2 million. <a href="http://stacksmashing.net/2010/11/20/cracking-passwords-in-the-cloud-getting-the-facts-straight/" target="_self">Roth further concludes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that was new is that, due to the new Amazon offering, everyone is able to spawn a 100-or-more node cluster in the cloud and distribute the task of cracking passwords onto these nodes. The task of cracking hashes is especially suitable for massive parallelization! An attacker could easily spawn a gigantic cluster of nodes using stolen credit card information, and it would be no problem for him to crack 8-character passwords in a nice timeframe.</p>

<p>So, &quot;recruiter&quot;, step up your game (and change your password, and your password algorithm).</p>

      <p><blockquote>
<p>There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say &quot;It is yet more difficult than you thought.&quot; This is the muse of form. It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.</p>

<p>This prose piece sometimes shows up on the net as poetry; that&#39;s how I found it. It&#39;s from <a href="http://brtom.typepad.com/wberry/2009/11/the-real-work-an-internet-adventure.html" target="_self">Wendell Berry&#39;s essay Poetry and Marriage, in his compilation Standing by Words. </a>Br. Tom Murphy tells a story of how he tracked this piece down from a fragment, and then realized he had given it to his students the previous semester.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two views of the Wisconsin recall election, in which Governor Scott Walker (R) survived a challenge from Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett (D). With 93% of precincts counted, Walker leads 54% to 45%.</p>
<p>The&#0160;<a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/results/live/wisconsin-recall" target="_self">Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel results map</a>&#0160;shows who won which county:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017615118e58970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017615118e58970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017615118e58970c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 1" /></a></p>
<p>The<a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/results/live/wisconsin-recall" target="_self"> New York Times coverage also shows the margin of victory</a>, which puts the map into stark relief:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0163062852fa970d-pi"><img alt="Nyt-size-of-lead-wisconsin-recall" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0163062852fa970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0163062852fa970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Nyt-size-of-lead-wisconsin-recall" /></a></p>
<p>Compare this with the<a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/wisconsin-recall-results#margin" target="_self"> less clear Huffington Post interactive recall results margin graphic</a>, which shows percentage size of lead on a county by county basis; that over-weights the color of rural counties, and underestimates the size of the urban difference in the total vote count.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0167671c0286970b-pi"><img alt="Huffington-post-county-margin-wisconsin-recall" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0167671c0286970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0167671c0286970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Huffington-post-county-margin-wisconsin-recall" /></a><br /><br />On, Wisconsin.</p>
