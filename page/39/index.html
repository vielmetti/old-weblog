<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do.</p>
<p>Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The maddening part of the network that doesn&#39;t work is that instead of working with the network you end up working to repair the network, and its unreliablity neither gives you access nor downtime.  In other words, spotty wifi is bad, worse than no wifi at all.</p>
<p>(Posted on the occasion of the repair of my MacBook&#39;s wifi card, which had been flaky for months.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My Mac is in the shop. It&#39;s getting a new wifi card, and while they are at it they&#39;ll replace the chipped case. The chip fixing means that labor is free for the wifi fixing so it&#39;s a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The last time I had any kind of extended computer downtime I remember it being a strain, since I then had so much of my personal computing stuff actually on my computer. Now more than ever that&#39;s not the case, and I get along just fine with occasional logins from library computer systems or even the ultra-basic stripped down version of apps that I get on my not-very-smart Blackberry.</p>
<p>At some point, everything that you care enough about is also in the cloud somewhere. That might be for backups, so that if you lose a system you can carry on with minimum restore time. It might be to increase the power of whatever web-enabled terminal you log into, so that whatever public system you connect to has most of your stuff even if that stuff is private. Mostly though things go into the cloud and stay there because all physical media are fragile. The consequences of relying on anything in your own possession - especially something that gets knocked around a bit - are too great, and it&#39;s better to have those things also or primarily somewhere else that feels safe.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><span>(originally posted January 26, 2003</span>&#0160;)</p>
<p>SEMOLINA PUDDING<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 cup milk<br />4 cups water<br />grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)<br />1 cup semolina flour<br />cinnamon<br />raspberries or other berries<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. Remove from heat and pour into bowl, mold, or cupcake pan. Refrigerate for at least two hours. Pudding should be somewhat firmer than chocolate pudding, but less firm than jello.<br /><br />When ready to serve, unmold pudding or leave in bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon. Top with raspberries or other fruit. Sugared raspberries are particularly nice when a little bit of sauce is formed and can be poured over the pudding.<br /><br />The pudding has a texture that is somehow both agreeably grainy and smooth and is very cooling in the summertime. You can vary the milk:water ratio in the recipe, even to the point of omitting one or the other entirely.<br /><br />(thanks to puddingmeister Deb for the recipe)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. It makes me want to start something brand new of my own - but then - you end up being captured by all of the tools you have to learn to bring it online.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing to think through this is that all new shiny online services have a lifespan. Some of them grow quickly and then die (remember Pownce? I thought not), some of them grow slowly and still live on somehow (remember Plurk?), others never get off the ground (a dozen tiny spam-overrun Twitter clones), and a tiny handful make it to Twitter size. You generally don&#39;t know when you&#39;re starting to talk to people through some new online system whether you are going to treat it as a long-term commitment to learning a complex system, or just some hands-on experimentation in something to be ignored and forgotten in a few weeks.</p>
<p>So you are a hamster, and you see a wheel. Do you get on to try it out, give yourself some exercise, or do you go to your workshop and build a better wheel?</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge.</p>
<p>Github is mostly about software, but there are lots of other things that lend themselves to incremental parallel development - development that doesn&#39;t have to follow the wiki model of last one in gets to edit. If you think of github (the hosting service) combined with some shared recipe archive (a la grouprecipes, the Usenet Cookbook, or whatever your favorite recipe starting place is) you&#39;re thinking about what I&#39;m thinking.</p>
<p>Lots of people cook the way you&#39;d expect, starting off from a given recipe and then branching out to accomodate the seasons, ingredients on hand, their own tastes and the tastes (picky) of their family. If I&#39;m doing a cookbook, I want to acknowledge that someone else&#39;s mac and cheese recipe was the starter of my own but I don&#39;t want to actually edit their cookbook in writing mine.</p>
<p>Besides, &quot;fork&quot; is such an obvious name for a cookbook tool.</p>

Of that fire line, 6 miles is Lake Superior shoreline, 13 miles is completed line (includes County Road 500), and 21 miles is uncontained fire line. Access is very difficult with few roads.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/AtGoogleTalks" rel="youtube" target="_blank" title="Andrew Keen">Andrew Keen</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Vertigo-Revolution-Diminishing-Disorienting/dp/0312624980" target="_self">Digital Vertigo</a> is a follow-on to his earlier <a title="The Cult of the Amateur: How Today&#39;s Internet is Killing Our Culture">The Cult of the Amateur</a>. Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">Facebook</a> and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful.</p></p>

<p>With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo. With a hefty 40 plus pages of end notes and indexing, there was hardly a page of the work that didn&#39;t echo someone else&#39;s thoughts.</p>

<p>With everything so carefully indexed and footnoted, I thought I&#39;d skip to the chase and see if the earliest arguments against technology in thought and human relations were also there. In The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phaedrus-Plato/dp/0872202208%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dsuperpatron-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0872202208" rel="amazon" target="_blank" title="Phaedrus">Phaedrus</a>, Plato relates argument the argument of Socrates that writing is a technology which leads to a diminishing of intelligence and of understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soc. I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately
like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude
of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn
silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine
that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and
put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying
answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled
about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and
know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are
maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they
cannot protect or defend themselves. (<a
href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm"
target="_self">Plato, The Phaedrus</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keen doesn&#39;t quote from Plato, but he does credit himself a &quot;celebrated public speaker&quot;. It&#39;s important that someone have a reasonable criticism of today&#39;s social networks, just so we can understand them better <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next.html" target="_self">when they inevitably change or fail</a>. This particular text probably reads better as an ebook, with all of its carefully collected citations linked; it might, like the example of Phaedrus, be even better in person delivered by the speaker who can vary his answer to incorporate the changes of the day and defend his thoughts.</p>

<p>A good book for an airplane ride, or a good ebook for a contrarian romp through modern social networks hype or to congratulate yourself for missing the Facebook IPO.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m in the midst of a job hunt, and so I expect that people I talk to who don&#39;t know me very well will take a look at this weblog as part of the things they look for when trying to assess who I am or to help prepare them to make small talk as a part of discussion. This is a good and useful reason to write in a weblog, to make yourself easy to strike up a conversation with.</p>
<p>As blogs go, Vacuum is relatively old school in that it deals with everything and nothing - you&#39;ll find dozens of categories, ranging from strawberry picking to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/05/power-outage-mapping.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="Power Outage Mapping">power outages</a> to seasonal holidays to technical discussions in a variety of fields. If it looks like a somewhat eclectic notebook, that&#39;s because it is. At various times when the need has arisen I&#39;ve pulled out separate weblogs to corral related information together. Superpatron, for innovation in library systems, was the one that really took off to have a life of its own for a while. When I wrote for AnnArbor.com, a weekly column on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/foia-jobs-looking-for-all-of-your-ideas-on-foiachat.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="FOIA jobs: looking for all of your ideas on #FOIAchat">FOIA</a> had enough cohesion to look like a body of work and not just a collection of ephemeral interests.</p>
<p>When you create a resume crafted for a particular job, you emphasize the particular skills and abilities you have and by keeping it brief you remove a whole set of other things. When you blog voraciously over a decade, you collect a whole lot of things that look temporarily interesting but sometimes - perhaps more than sometimes - just turn out to be interesting of the moment.</p>
<p>So, hi. You&#39;re reading this. There&#39;s a lot here, if you search. If you ask about anything, there&#39;s probably more to be said. I assume that you&#39;ll understand if there&#39;s some things here that look unfinished, because that&#39;s by design.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Imagine that it&#39;s the year 2020; it&#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?</p>
<p><em>Something new</em></p>
<p>One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a perpetual demand for new means of expression online, and a perpetual supply of people trying to build an &quot;eyeball business&quot; to service that quest for novelty. The newness can express itself as exclusivity, or as a better way to share photographs, or by removing features that other systems take for granted. Whatever it is, the barriers for creating Yet Another Social Network Service are low.</p>
<p><em>Advertising may not sustain growth</em></p>
<p>A second possibility is that Facebook makes some same mistake that Myspace does of creating too much advertising inventory that&#39;s worth too little per use, and that marketing people and advertising people move their budgets elsewhere because they can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) want to prove their results. General Motors decided that both Facebook ads and Super Bowl ads were of little use, and they might be the harbinger of a bigger trend.</p>
<p>As communications systems grow, there are more and more pieces of them where no one has designed an ad specifically to target the niche that&#39;s being expressed in that one piece of online behavior. You thus end up with a huge inventory of space that has to be filled with something, and a need to create that supply of advertisers who don&#39;t really care where that ad goes as long as it&#39;s frequent.</p>
<p><em>The dream of the public internet</em></p>
<p>The Internet purist would hope that Facebook is displaced by open protocols and public interfaces, rather than private APIs. This is also the hope of every development team with a set of bright ideas unwilling to tether themselves to someone else&#39;s system.</p>
<p>The history of the public internet has been expansive growth at times (Usenet news, the World Wide Web) alternated with periods where the money and attention flowed into walled gardens (Compuserve, AOL). Facebook is more like AOL than it is like Usenet, and since it has to build all of its infrastructure it&#39;s at risk from innovative internetworked distributed systems where many people can play.</p>
<p>Usenet died of its own weight, overrun by success, by AOL users, and by spam and pornography. The Web spawned a whole series of mostly open systems, but really never reinvented Usenet in its pure form of distributed discussion groups where everyone you&#39;d want to talk to on every possible subject is always online. The net might just be too big to have something other than central control decisions make for orderly governance.</p>
<p><em>Mobile turns the tables</em></p>
<p>Finally, it&#39;s quite plausible that as more of our Internet time is absorbed in mobile devices that no one will figure out quickly how to take enough money from that particular set of users vs. the big-screen computer users who have lots of on-screen space for ads.</p>
<p>Imagine there&#39;s no Facebook; it&#39;s easy if you have a long memory back to eight years ago. There&#39;s some arc that innovative online systems go through from early adopter to mainstream to old news. A lot of new systems will try to capture our attention, our friendships, and our willingness to pay over the rest of the decade, and the network of 2020 will not simply be a bigger version of the net of 2012.</p>

<blockquote>If you were there for Compuserve, AOL, Tripod, Friendster, Orkut, MySpace or LinkedIn, you might have believed the same thing about any one of those social networks. Remember when those CD Roms from AOL came in the mail almost every day? The company was considered ubiquitous, invincible. Former AOL CEO Steve Case was no less a genius than Mark Zuckerberg.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/04/08/was-it-google-who-killed-myspace/">GigaOm in 2011 on Google and Myspace</a> and poor quality advertising:</p>
<blockquote>Think back to 2006: That’s when they signed the $900 million, three-year advertising deal to turn Google into Myspace’s exclusive providers of text ads and search. It was a great cash prize for Murdoch’s purchase, but actually ended up being a weight around its neck. The deal’s targets required Myspace to crank up page views and increase already-heavy advertising space at precisely the same moment that Facebook was pushing forward with a clean and easily-understood design.</blockquote>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The problem of poor quality advertising on Facebook is noted in the context of <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57437885-71/how-zuckerbergs-wedding-reveals-facebooks-problem/">constipation ads on Zuckerberg&#39;s wedding announcement</a> by Chris Matyszczyk of CNET.</p>
<blockquote>If ads for heart attacks and constipation on its most important page of celebration are anything to go by, the company has a long, long way to go in order to even begin to make advertising work. May I wish the happy couple all the wealth, um, happiness in the world. I hope as they log on to Facebook this morning to view all the good wishes, they aren&#39;t being served with ads for divorce lawyers, marriage guidance counselors and, um, investment advisers.</blockquote>

<p>None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&#39;ll share those when I have them; it&#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day.</p>
<p>Some likely opening dates:</p>
<p>Whittaker&#39;s Berry Farm, Ida MI:&#0160;&#0160;May 28th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2012 Strawberry Season has arrived! &#0160;We will be open for the season TOMORROW, MAY 28TH, 8:00am-8:00pm. &#0160;The berries we are picking Monday are called Honeoye, they are very deep red in color, and have a DELICIOUS flavor!</p>

      <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.</a></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Smart grid">smart grid</a>&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online.</p>
<p>To support a continuing interest in this field, I&#39;m looking at starting up a new blog to capture news articles, collect new maps and applications as they appear, and generally keep up with the world of smart grid mapping efforts. Look for this on a new <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/outage" target="_self">Power Outage Mapping</a> weblog.</p>

      <p>I used the Automark machine to vote today, as I did in 2010 (<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/voting-machine-links-automark/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story</a>) and in 2008 (<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html" target="_self">Vacuum post</a>).</p>

<p>This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.</p>
<p>For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. Since I can see just fine, I wasn&#39;t able to tell if the audio instructions were perfect, but they seemed pretty good and straightforward.</p>
<p>After my encounter with the poll worker, I went to city hall to give the election officials a report on what had happened. The person I talked to at city hall pulled out a guide to poll workers (from 2008) and did not immediately find specific instructions one way or the other about using the Automark, but we didn&#39;t read every page.</p>

      <p>Tonight&#39;s Ann Arbor City Council meeting <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2012/05/07/city-council-oks-justice-center-art/" target="_self">discussed at great length the expenditure of some sizable sum of money for art</a> that would be installed in the secured lobby of the Justice Center part of City Hall, where would you have to go through a security check to visit it.</p>
<p>What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it.</p>
<p>A proposal was put forth to not spend the money on art and to renovate some bathrooms in the building instead. This left a missed opportunity to instead ready-made art as part of that installation. (photo: wikimedia commons, from the original photo by Alfred Stieglitz).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar characteristics of writing for yourself and not just creating copy is that you end up finding things from your past that you still own enough to re-edit and rework as needed. A recent discussion on Twitter about paw paws helped me unearth <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/papaws-the-mich.html" target="_self">a 2008 collection of scrapbook entries about the fruit, its names, and how it tastes.</a>&nbsp;If I had produced this content for an employer (or an ex-employer), it would be long since frozen and old; but because it's just my writing, I can go back and make it better four years later.</p>
<p>I've been happy with Typepad for a long time. Recently, some of the management changes at the organization that runs it have led to some changes in the marketing around the service, so that the relatively few old-school bloggers like me still on the system seem less and less to be the target audience, in favor of professional media people who have a certain number of words of content that they are obligated to produce before they move to the next task. I guess I can only be hopeful that the sorts of tools that are needed to crank out content on the job can also be used for old fashioned blogging where the deadlines are less definite and the goals more ambiguous.</p>

The paw paw discussion came and went on Twitter, as twitter things tend to do, without leaving too much of an obvious trace; <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MickiMaynard/status/196658685341220864" target="_self">Micki Maynard</a> and Dave Askins were at the center of it.

<p>In 2011, the number of workers belonging to a union in Michigan was 671,000, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported [on&#0160;Monday, April 9, 2012]. Regional Commissioner Charlene Peiffer noted that union members accounted for 17.5 percent of wage and salary workers in Michigan in 2011 compared to 16.5 percent a year earlier. At its peak in 1989, the first year state data were available, Michigan’s union membership rate was 26.0 percent.

<p>David Erdody, a digital curator at the Bentley Historical Library, discovered a series of 20 photo negatives in early January that feature King giving a speech and hosting a discussion at the University.
