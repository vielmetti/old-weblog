        <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for Kedgeree - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.
 2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee 1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt, pepper fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch hard boiled eggs for garnish  The method runs roughly as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-20-kedgeree-or-something-quite-similar-to-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.
The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-08-new-to-me-at-least-for-80s-music-on-the-radio-play-30-year-old-casey-kasem-top-40-countdown-shows-exactly-as-originally-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.
&quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-21-the-universal-authority-on-authorities-from-second-hand-knowledge-patrick-wilson/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Global Tuners is a worldwide project for people to share their shortwave radio receivers.

I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-14-global-tuners-listening-to-far-off-radio-stations/">&raquo;</a></p>

Here&#39;s a snapshot from mid-afternoon ; the base map grid shows the most commonly used routes.
 The system began in Minneapolis two years ago.

        <p>Washington, DC is getting a new Metro map, and some new services. Called Rush Plus, it&#39;s designed to add additional service to existing lines and to change the rush-hour routing of some trains so that you can make more connections without a transfer.
The full Metro map is here, in all its PDF glory; the sample below is hoped to be a reasonable size.

Here&#39;s a map of the telemetry that was visible through APRS.FI&#0160;for the duration of the launch. The device is identified as KC8SBA.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!
I used the Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-washing-machine-hose-leak-repair/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Change your LinkedIn password.
News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak/">&raquo;</a></p>

It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course.
