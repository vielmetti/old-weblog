<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, December 22, 2011 - Three strong earthquakes of more than magnitude 5 hit Christchurch, New Zealand today, disrupting the power and telecommunications networks in the area and damaging roads and structures because of liquefaction of the soil. Damage and injury estimates are incomplete as of this writing.</p>
<blockquote>

(A geologist) was keen to use the photos in a paper he was writing and said (and I more-or-less quote) “I’ve been to substantial earthquakes all over the world for the past 30 years and I haven’t seen liquefaction anywhere near as bad as it is in Christchurch.

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://bjfogg.com" target="_self">BJ Fogg</a> is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce <a href="http://bit.ly/3tinyhabits" target="_self">three tiny habits</a> that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a perfect example of a tiny habit, since cleaning the kitchen can take a while.</p>
<p>The practice of tiny habits is radically different from the typical New Year&#39;s Resolution which is grandiose, sweeping, and hard to fulfill. &quot;Be a better person&quot; is really different from &quot;brush your teeth after you floss them&quot; or &quot;go to bed after the computer goes to sleep&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out the tiny habit that will get me writing regularly. Ideally, in some perfect world, I&#39;d write more regularly. I don&#39;t want a &quot;write a page every day&quot; goal, because that&#39;s largely unmanagable - when would I do it? But perhaps I can set myself a tiny goal, that&#39;s more like &quot;when I sit down at the computer after the kitchen is clean, open it up to my blog and start writing until I stop.&quot;</p>
<p>At the very least, that will ensure that the kitchen will be clean before bedtime.</p>

      <p>There&#39;s a great use of the term in an LA Magazine review of &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.</blockquote>
<p>Credits: the &quot;mental rolodex&quot; term is one I heard first from&#0160;<a href="http://trybean.com">Terry Bean</a>, who used it at an LA2M presentation. It&#39;s also from&#0160;<a href="http://rebekahburgess.blogspot.com/">Rebekah Burgess&#39;s weblog of the same name</a>, where she is doing a daily photograph and filing that away for reference.&#0160;</p>
<p>And kids, if you don&#39;t know what a rolodex is, it&#39;s from the days when people had land lines phones only and their phones were so dumb that they didn&#39;t have an address book built into them. Instead, they wrote down phone numbers on little pieces of specially shaped paper, and those pieces of paper fit into a clever device that could be flipped through or (in ultra cool setup) spun like a Ferris wheel.</p>

      <p>Typepad has a very convenient &quot;drafts&quot; folder into which you can write things that aren&#39;t ready for publication yet. My drafts folder is overflowing. I suppose that means that the editor in me is looking forward to reviewing them and sending them back for revisions.</p>
<p>If you wait long enough between the time you write something and the time you publish it, it&#39;s possible that you can make your writing enough better to be worth the wait. Generally, though, the work that I like the most has been edited in public. If my writing doesn&#39;t escape the draft folder quickly, chances are pretty good that it isn&#39;t ever worth publishing, even in an open notebook.</p>

Digitization is seen variously as a boon and scourge, depending on the viewer, the issue at hand, and sometimes even the time of day. As with many polarizing phenomena, there is merit on both sides. If we look carefully at the functions that we want libraries to perform, we see that although most (but not all) are made technically easier with digitization, many are made organizationally more difficult, both within libraries and within the institutions that support them and use them. Preservation, which I will argue is an essential function of academic libraries, is the most straightforward example of something that is much more difficult to organize with digital media than it was with print. Scholarly publishing, without which libraries would have little to do, is stuck with a set of institutions and practices that are ill-suited to take advantage of digital technologies. And then there is copyright. Taking as given that we now live in a world where it extremely inexpensive to copy, distribute, search, mix, and remix, it is still not entirely clear how best to respond to what should be good news. The answers depend on what we want and how willing we are to collaborate in the interest of achieving it. As in many cases, successful exploitation of changes in technology requires changes in the way activities are organized.<br />

      <p><blockquote>[New] technologies are currently being viewed as either substitutes for, or possible augmentations of, human faculties. I argue that the proffered scenarios of computerized ‘help’ for human activities evident in the ubiquitous computing world tends to focus on augmentation of human remembering, with sensors and computer networks archiving vast amounts of data, but neglects to consider what augmentation might mean when it comes to that other human activity, namely, forgetting.

<p><small>via <a href="http://www.contemplativecomputing.org/2011/12/forgetting-as-a-feature-not-a-bug.html">www.contemplativecomputing.org</a></small></p>
<p>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is reading an article by <a href="http://www.idc.ul.ie/people/liam-bannon" target="_self">Liam Bannon</a>, director of the Interaction Design Centre at the University of Limerick, on forgetting as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>I started down the path of thinking about how computers currently handle the process of forgetting, and as part of that better understand what kind of metaphors are missing for the task of augmenting forgetting.</p>
<p>There&#39;s the notion of &quot;garbage collection&quot;, when unwanted memory is reclaimed. That process relies on a way of marking unwanted (computer) memory as forgettable. Every so often the garbage collection process runs, slowing down the system as it does, and cleaning up the mess left behind.</p>
<p>Computers also have the notion and defect of a &quot;memory leak&quot;, where unwanted memory accumulates in a state where it&#39;s taking up space but not really doing anything. A slow memory leak in a long running process will eventually bring a system down as more and more system resources are absorbed and never freed.</p>
<p>When memory does go bad in a computer world, it&#39;s &quot;bitrot&quot; - think about old tapes that have glitch errors, or more importantly old computer programs that have a hard time digesting new formats of data. This often happens when a new and improved technology foregoes compatibility with old formats, with the clean slate being easier to build from rather than re-encrufting some old system.</p>
<p>Cloud computing has its own feature of forgetting, in the &quot;sunset&quot; phase of an online service where unpopular, unprofitable, or unendearing features or services get deliberately turned off. If you had relied on that system for your external memory you are in for a rude surprise.</p>
<p>The worrisome aspect of computer memory is its binary nature, where a single transient glitch can render mass storage unreadable, and so rather than the healthy forgetting of the human brain you get sudden unrecoverable failure. Your carefully pickled up thoughts or rolodex full of context vanishes, and suddenly you have to rely on your mental rolodex rather than the paper or electronic one to recall details.</p>

      <p>Follow the coverage from all sides.</p>

<p>National coverage: ESPN's <a href="http://espn.go.com/colleges/michigan/">WolverineNation</a> coverage from beat writer <a href="https://twitter.com/mikerothstein">Michael Rothstein</a>. <a href="http://espn.go.com/colleges/michigan/football/story/_/id/7316280/michigan-wolverines-land-sugar-bowl">Michigan Wolverines Land Sugar Bowl</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It almost didn't happen, however. After finishing the regular season 10-2, the Wolverines needed help from other teams around the country on Saturday and from the pollsters on Sunday morning in order to be in this position -- and they received it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Virginia Tech, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/virginia-tech-hokies-a-surprise-pick-for-sugar-bowl/2011/12/04/gIQAghsCUO_story.html">Washington Post writes</a> "one of the most surprising Bowl Championship Series at-large picks ever". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virginia Tech’s BCS at-large hopes appeared to evaporate after its 38-10 loss to Clemson in the ACC championship game Saturday. While the Hokies have been ranked all season, they have not defeated a team currently in the Associated Press top 25 poll.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game is in New Orleans, and Michigan's ever-efficient alumni association has an <a href="http://alumni.umich.edu/sports/athletic-tours-and-travel-packages/official-bowl-tours">official bowl tour package</a> complete with chartered flights. </p>

<p>New Orleans is a great place to eat a sandwich. <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/686440">Chowhound has a best sandwiches</a> thread that's got a lot of great suggestions; I'd pick a banh mi (in its role as a Vietnamese po'boy). In Ann Arbor the blog "Meg Goes Nom Nom" has a <a href="http://meggoesnomnom.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/meggoesnomnoms-one-year-birthday-banh-mi/">glowing review of the banh mi from Zingerman's</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And a few months after this occurred, I discovered that the featured sandwich at local favorite Zingerman’s Delicatessen was the Banh Mi. It was time! And not only get to try the sandwich, I got to meet the talented creator of this legit sandwich while I was there. Awesome! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Zing sandwich was done by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanstreetfood">San Street</a>, a food cart which alas I have not checked out myself yet.</p>

<p>The Viet World Kitchen blog has a <a href="http://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/06/banh-mi-sandwich-recipe.html">master banh mi recipe</a> which pretty much sums up what you'd need to put together your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is essentially one sandwich in Vietnamese cooking and it is quite a tour de force. It started out very simply, with baguette smeared with liver pate and that was it. That's how my mom knew it in the 1940s when she was growing up in Northern Vietnam. What we know today as banh mi is a light, crispy small baguette that is split and hollowed before it is invariably filled with homemade mayonnaise or butter (which I don't like), sliced chili pepper, cilantro leaves, cucumber, a tangy-sweet daikon and carrot pickle (do chua), and a drizzle of soy sauce. The variation comes in when you choose what protein component(s) will be center stage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More recipe action gets you a <a href="http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/2010/08/13/do-chua-vietnamese-carrot-and-daikon-pickle/">do chua recipe from the blog Sticky Gooey Creamy Chewy</a>, which sounds easy enough to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do chua is so incredibly easy to make. Since it is a “fresh” pickle, there is no boiling or cooking involved. All you do is julienne the carrots and daikon, and soak them in a brine made with white vinegar, rice wine vinegar, a little water, sugar and a pinch of salt. That’s it!  Plus, the pickles only need to marinate in their brine for about an hour before they’re ready to devour.</p>

<p>Now, you are ready for some football.</p>

<p>For who does not love sandwiches? They are compact, and amiable, and easy to pack for lunch. If you have a generous lunch budget, you have have someone else make you a sandwich of wide variety on the spot and enjoy it at your leisure.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The technical description is from <a href="http://drought.unl.edu/MonitoringTools/NASAGRACEDataAssimilation.aspx">Groundwater and Soil Moisture Conditions from GRACE Data Assimilation</a>, one of the sets of maps available at the <a href="http://drought.unl.edu/">National Drought Mitigation Center</a> at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launched in 2002, NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites are unique in their ability to measure variations in water stored at all levels above and within the land surface (terrestrial water storage). However, the spatial (>150,000 km2) and temporal (monthly with a significant time lag) resolutions of the GRACE fields limit their direct applicability for drought assessment. In order to increase the resolution, eliminate the time lag, and isolate groundwater and other components from total terrestrial water storage, scientists at NASA/GSFC integrate the GRACE data with other ground- and space-based meteorological observations (precipitation, solar radiation, etc.) within the Catchment Land Surface Model, using Ensemble Kalman smoother type data assimilation (Zaitchik et al., 2008). The resulting fields of soil moisture and groundwater storage variations are then used to generate drought indicators based on the cumulative distribution function of wetness conditions during 1948-2009 simulated by the Catchment model. Houborg et al. (2011) provide complete details on GRACE-based drought indicator product generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got it? This map shows groundwater storage estimated with this model, showing the extensive drought conditions in Texas as well as the wet northeast.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>My phone is either nearing the end of its useful life, or reaching the start of some new useful life; I'm not sure which.</p>

<p>Its one true calling is as a terminal for Twitter, and that task it does admirably. Everything else is marginal or slow at best. But Twitter and a fast keyboard makes up for all of that.</p>

<p>The phone in question is a Blackberry Pearl with one of those squooshed keyboards that makes typing an adventure but also lets the phone fit into very small places. I loathe the idea of getting an Android phone without a good keyboard, and an iPhone is just not appealing for the price. I don't need another Blackberry because, hey, I have my Twitterphone!</p>

<p>When all you have is a Twitterphone, every problem looks like Twitter. Need to search for a restaurant, report a problem with squeaky brakes, look for a weather report, pretty much anything - Twitter. And to the extent that your world is Twitter shaped, that's a reasonable excuse for a device to carry with you everywhere.</p>

<p>I am sure that if I got some other device, that some other strong point of it would come to the fore. I'm sure there's a perfect phone for Facebook, a ideal device for LinkedIn, a super handset for your employer's Android application. The question of search for "which device do I want" becomes impossible because you know that you will adapt to whatever you have rather than discarding it, to some extreme extent of making or losing friends because of what you hold in your hand.</p>

      <p>Tasks to take on at the end of filling up a paper notebook.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read through the whole thing, copying out the good parts. There are bound to be enough good parts that you want to save and remember some of them, and scanning them in is one way to preserve the rough qualities. Retyping a clean copy with additional notes inspired by the original is another way to manage that same task.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider shredding the bad parts. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/vacuum-0.html">Forgetting is as important as remembering</a>, and you can channel <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/03/note-to-self-15.html">15 minutes of Discardia</a> by getting rid of junk that is just taking up space. Of course this is a horror if it's a true laboratory notebook, but I'm not going to make that assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile an index of names. Figuring out who you were thinking of along the way is at least as interesting to methodically review as what you were thinking about, since the review process may be as simple as reconnecting with someone who sparked a great idea but with whom you haven't had that conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a suitable visual design for a new notebook. Figure out how to be inspired by the blank page again, and use a design that matches something that causes you to start the page full of ideas. A blank page can be more constraining than one that has some structure already filled in, and a great page layout can be inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what it is that you will be carrying with you every day. The only way to fill a notebook is to have it handy. Don't allow it to go unused simply because it isn't there, or because you don't have a pen or pencil always within reach.</p></li>
</ol>
