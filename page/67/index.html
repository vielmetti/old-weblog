<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">Achieving Extraordinary Organizational Performance Through Diversity<br />

<strong>Friday, November 21, 1-2:15 p.m.</strong><br />
Founders Room, Alumni Center<br />
200 Fletcher</p>

<p>Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant
individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&#39;s
predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond
the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page
discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&#39;re talking
about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why
diversity trumps ability. Come and learn why progress depends as much
on our collective differences as it does on our individual IQ scores!

Instructor: Prof. Nick Ellis (<a href="mailto:ncellis@umich.edu" target="_blank">ncellis@umich.edu</a> &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:ncellis@umich.edu" target="_blank">ncellis@umich.edu</a>&gt;)</p><p>

We consider Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent research
across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, is processed, and changes over time. However, there is
mounting evidence that processes of language acquisition, use and
change are not independent from one another but are facets of the same
complex adaptive system. A conference on this theme at UMich in
November 2008 brought together international scholars active in their
recognition of complexity in their respective areas, ranging from
language usage, structure, and change, sociolinguistics, cognitive
linguistics, anthropology, language evolution, complex systems, first
language acquisition, second language acquisition, psycholinguistics
and language processing, language education, individual differences,
and language testing. For details see <a href="http://elicorpora.info/LLC" target="_blank">http://elicorpora.info/LLC</a>.</p><p>
Each week as a class we (i) view the podcast recording of their
presentation, (ii) read their associated journal article, and (iii)
discuss this theme.</p><p>
This course crosses different branches of psychology, linguistics,
education, complex systems, and cognitive science, and we welcome
students of these and related perspectives.</p><p>
Students will be expected to read and participate in the discussion of
all topics, write a term paper on one of these topics discussed with
the instructor (either a literature review or a research proposal with
some pilot work), and present the work from their term paper at the end
of the course.</p><p>
Readings and resources:</p><p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm at the Google App Engine hackathon in Ann Arbor.&nbsp; My goal for the day is to get a Django instance running on top of appengine as much as possible, using as much of the existing code base that's out there that I can.&nbsp; (This instead of say, hacking a wiki, which is what their sample app is - been there done that.)</p><p>Here's some background reading:</p><p><a href="http://www.42topics.com/dumps/django/docs.html">Using Django with Appengine</a> - Shabda Raaj.&nbsp; "Welcome to Django tutorial for integrating with Appengine. This is a port of the <a class="reference" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/">Django tutorial</a>
to use appengine instead of Pure Django.
Like in the Django tutorial, we build a poll engine, where you can
create polls and others can vote for them. Instead of the four part
Django tutorial, we use only one tutorial. Also, as many parts of
Django, most prominently its <strong>super</strong>
Admin interface do not work, we will work around them. I will assume
that you know python well. However I do not assume that you have
previous experience with Django. Django concepts are explained."</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/">app-engine-patch</a> - </p><p>With app-engine-patch a major part of Django works on App Engine
without any modifications. The most important change is that you have
to use Google's <tt>Model</tt> class because the development model is too different from Django. </p><p>We also integrate a package called <strong>ragendja</strong> which provides functions that simplify Django and App Engine development. </p><p>to be continued....</p><p>
Here's Guido van Rossum's keynote in September 2008 about Google App Engine and Django.</p>

<p>First spotted via Facebook - <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2008/11/13/santa-barbara-fire/">Doc Searls reports on the Santa Barbara fire</a>&nbsp;that started November 13, 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I’m listening to KNX/1070 from Los Angeles right now. “The main body of this fire is in wilderness, but there are homes below the thick black smoke… 60 mph winds… East of Mountain Drive and Cold Springs Road… the KCAL helicopter is fighting turbulence. Heavy winds.” Now they’re talking to the retired fire chief. He says the winds are high and “downcanyon” toward the ocean. “There are structures involved in this fire.” Now burning Southwest. That’s toward town. Bad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The fire apparently started near the Tea Gardens hence the name "Tea Fire"; sometimes it's seen just as "T Fire".

<p>
With any fire like this there are lots of resources from the net that will emerge in the next not very many minutes to help track it. Here's a start at what I could find.

Researchers Hijack Storm Worm to Track Profits</strong><br /><br />
A single response from 12 million e-mails is all it takes for spammers
to turn annual profits of millions of dollars promoting knockoff
pharmaceuticals, according to an unprecedented new study on the
economics of spam.<br /><br />
Over a period of about a month in the Spring of 2008, researchers at
the University of California, San Diego and UC Berkeley sought to
measure the conversion rate of spam by quietly infiltrating the Storm
worm botnet, a vast collection of compromised computers once
responsible for sending an estimated 20 percent of all spam.</div><p></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a Wiki Wednesday series; this post is NOT FINISHED but I needed to post it anyway.</p><p>Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same.</p><p>Here is an outline of how to explain wiki to Word users.&#0160; It is broken into three parts:&#0160; the mechanics of moving documents from Word into wiki, the process of working together on a document, and formatting the resulting work for delivery to a client. &#0160; The first part, document import, is going to vary depending on which wiki platform you are using; I&#39;ll illustrate here with <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">Socialtext</a>, which does this task in response to very specific demands from early customers.&#0160; The second piece on collaboration within wiki is fundamental to the change that people will need to internalize on how work gets done inside a wiki, and it&#39;s the hardest to experience without going hands on.&#0160; Finally, the process of moving completed works from wiki to some other presentation format is worth going through, and again the devil is in the details.</p><p><strong>What is a wiki page, and how does it differ from a Word document?</strong></p><p>A wiki page can be thought of as a single document inside a collection of related documents.&#0160; It is typically designed to have multiple authors, and it may or may not have a final published version that is delivered on paper or other static form.&#0160; In most cases, people editing the wiki page will be online while they are doing it, and their changes will be instantly reflected in the page text.</p><p>In contrast, a Word document can be thought of as a single document unconnected to any related documents.&#0160; At any time it has a single author, and there is very typically a final published version which is designed and formatted for distirbution.&#0160; In most cases, people editing a Word document will do it independent of Internet access.&#0160; Changes from multiple people are typically done sequentially, with subsequent authors able to accept or reject annotated changes in Track Changes.</p><p>Word is overwhelmingly presentation focused, and generally provides tools for people to build documents that look great.&#0160; Most wikis have much more limited user control over the aesthetics of the page, and are often designed around collaboration first and only secondarily on presentation for print.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>I have an existing draft of a document that I want to upload to a wiki to edit.&#0160; How do I do that?</strong></p><p>In most cases, you can cut and paste from any document on the Internet or any Word document directly into a wiki page.&#0160; Some formatting will be lost, and some features of the original source document (footnotes, side bars, page layout, and more) will not be preserved.</p><p>Sociatext ... document import ... ???<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>How do I track the changes in a way that I&#39;m used to within a wiki?</strong></p><p>Edit ... change ... reconcile versions.&#0160; Parallel development, merge.</p><p>Edit, edit, comment on versions.&#0160; Serial development, no merge.</p><p>Change log, history, who edited which when, what were the differences.&#0160; Diff based, not red line.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Who gets to edit this document, and how do I know that we&#39;re done?</strong></p><p>Wiki permissions, edit vs view.&#0160; Social control, expectations, soft security within an enterprise.&#0160;<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>The three people I&#39;m cooperating with have differences of opinion.&#0160; How do we reconcile these differences within a wiki?</strong></p><p>Three way document review inside Word is a huge pain to make sure you get all of the changes merged in in parallel. &#0160;You can serialize the process by having the document go round-robin but sometimes that introduces unacceptable delays.</p><p><strong>I need to take this document that we have made and make it beautiful for print (or PDF) and make it final so that the client can&#39;t make changes.&#0160; How do I do that?</strong></p><p>... is just a start; we haven&#39;t even hit footnotes, tables, immutable boilerplate, annotations in the change log, accept or reject changes, and ...&#0160; The ... is ..., and ...</p><p>-------</p><p>I wonder sometimes which portion of the population has the wiki circuitry in their brains that allow them to light it up and make sense of that environment, and which part does not and will never &quot;get it&quot;.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The Fitzgerald cleared Superior, Wisconsin, on her last trip on November 9, 1975, with a cargo of 26,116 tons of taconite pellets consigned to Detroit. Traveling down Lake Superior in company with ARTHUR M. ANDERSON of the United States Steel Corporation&#39;s Great Lakes Fleet, she encountered heavy weather and in the early evening of November 10th, suddenly foundered approximately 17 miles from the entrance to Whitefish Bay (47º North Latitude, 85º 7&#39; West Longitude)

On November 9 at 7 p.m. the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a gale warning for Lake Superior. In a gale, the wind speeds range from 34-40 knots. The NWS predicted east to northeasterly winds during the night, shifting to NW to N by the afternoon of November 10. At approximately 10:40 p.m. the NWS revised its forecast for eastern Lake Superior to easterly winds becoming southeasterly the morning of the 10th. At about 2:00 am November 10 the NWS upgraded the gale warning to a storm warning (winds 48-55 knots) with a prediction of &quot;northeast winds 35 to 50 knots becoming northwesterly 28 to 38 knots on Monday, waves 8 to 15 feet&quot;. Around 2 a.m. the Captains of the Anderson and Fitzgerald discussed the threatening weather and decided to change their route. This safer route would take them northward, toward the coast of Canada. The northern route would protect them from the waves that the storm generated.

again been suckered into coming into Panera only to find that the
network is kaput. The network here is now well and truly down more than
it’s up, at least when I’m here. It’s even more kaput than usual today,
too.<br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.technologyevangelist.com/2008/04/tinyurlcom_blocked_b.html">TinyURL.com is blocked by Panera Bread, notes Technology Evangelist :</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I can understand Panera choosing to block porn sites, since it could
be disturbing for customers to glance over to see a neighboring table

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">But why is TinyURL.com banned? Why not just block inappropriate

which land does well for its inhabitants, citizens do well by their
land, and both end up better by reason of partnership. Aldo Leopold
recognized that no matter how sophisticated we become, people will
always depend on the land—“the land” being shorthand for the community
that not only includes and values people but also plants, animals,
soils, and waters, from the highest strata of the atmosphere to the
depths of the ocean. We often take natural resources and ecosystems for
granted, but, ultimately, the planet’s natural communities and natural
functions are what sustain our economy and enrich our lives. “That land
is a community,” Leopold wrote, “is the basic concept of ecology, but
that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics.” </p><p class="padding">Aldo is the grandfather of Scott and Todd Leopold, who ran the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/index.php/Leopold_Bros">Leopold Bros</a> brewpub and distillery from a converted brake factory on Main Street in Ann Arbor.&#0160; <a href="http://homelessdave.com/tt20060906toddleopold.htm">(Here&#39;s an interview of Todd Leopold on Teeter Talk.)</a> <a href="http://www.leopoldbros.com/Leopold_Bros./Welcome.html">Scott and Todd have relocated to Colorado, where they have focused on their small batch, hand distilled spirits.</a></p>

 Since it&#39;s game day (Michigan at Minnesota) I thought I&#39;d link to at least a few connections between Michigan and Minnesota.</p><p>1.&#0160; The Little Brown Jug is the trophy that goes back and forth between the two schools depending on which one wins the game.&#0160; It was originally purchased as a water jug for the Michigan team on an away game to Minnesota in 1903, it was left behind after the game (a 6-6 tie).&#0160; <a href="http://www.thedailygopher.com/2008/11/6/655570/the-little-brown-jug">The Daily Gopher has an excellent roundup of the story (warning: Minnesota point of view) quoting from several Michigan football blogs.</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Days later when Yost sent a letter requesting his water jug back, Cook replied saying &quot;<em>We have your little brown jug; if you want it, you’ll have to win it.</em>&quot; <br /></div><p><br />More on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Little_Brown_Jug">Little Brown Jug</a>, and on the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Brown_Jug">Brown Jug</a> (a South University campus bar and restaurant) at Arborwiki.</p><p>2.&#0160; Michigan shares a border with Minnesota along Lake Superior, and there is public transportation by ferry from Houghton, Michigan to Grand Portage, Minnesota via a stop at the Isle Royale National Park.&#0160;&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://www.isleroyaleboats.com/">Minnesota to Isle Royale ferry information:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Grand Portage Isle Royale Transportation Line began as a way for the
    Sivertson family of Lake Superior&#39;s north shore to transport their catch of
    freshwater fish from Isle Royale to Minnesota. It gradually expanded to include
    passenger service. <br /></div><p><br /><a href="http://www.nps.gov/isro">Michigan to Isle Royale ferry information:</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Unlike other Isle Royale ferry services, the Ranger III was designed by
the National Park Service specifically to bridge the gap between the
mainland and the Island. It was built to withstand the Lake’s fierce
storms and its ice breaking capabilities assist in opening the park in
the spring. An experienced nine-member crew take great pride in not
only maintaining the vessel, but in serving its passengers. The Ranger
III’s Captain, Bill Hanrahan, a graduate of the Great Lakes Maritime
Academy, has over&#0160;30 years of experience; the crews combined experience
is just under 200 years.</div><p><br />3.&#0160; Ann Arbor, MI was the site of GopherCon &#39;92, a 50 person workshop for developers and users of the Gopher information system, a pioneering Internet publishing system that was for some brief furry moment the hot new thing on MTV and bigger than that super-complicated World Wide Web hypertext thing.&#0160; <a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt">Prentiss Riddle wrote up the trip report for it,</a> and here&#39;s his writeup on my presentation at the time:</p><blockquote><p>RELATED TECHNOLOGIES: Ed Vielmetti of CICnet gave a talk on &quot;what we would be gathering to discuss if UMinn had never developed Gopher&quot;, meaning primarily World-Wide Web (WWW). WWW was developed for the high-energy physics community and serves as a model of what Gopher could do if a discipline-oriented virtual community invested in it<br />heavily. WWW is based on SGML (Standard General Markup Language&quot;), an ISO standard for marking up text which WWW uses to implement hypertext. SGML is a bear and it is a significant investment of effort to properly add a document to WWW, but the result is quite powerful (for instance, WWW handles footnotes in hypertext). </p></blockquote>
<p>The Internet periodically notices that Gopher is not dead; here are a survey of the current Gopher infrastructure from <a href="http://kottke.org/06/08/gopher-still-going">Jason Kottke</a>, some April development from <a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/geekery/howto_make_a_weblog_a_gopherlog.php">George Hotelling</a>, and a manifesto from <a href="http://www.scn.org/%7Ebkarger/gopher-manifesto">Bjorn Karger</a>.&#0160; </p>

<p>Along with all of the other t-shirts (Michigan Beer Pong, Michigan Undecided) for sale on State Street before football games, a new one has appeared this year:&nbsp; &ldquo;2008 Worst Season Ever&rdquo;.</p><p>Not being one to quarrel with a t-shirt, I thought I&rsquo;d go back through history and see just how bad this year&rsquo;s team is compared to teams of the past.</p><p>1.&nbsp; Rich Rodriguez has the worst lifetime record (2-7) of any Michigan football coach.&nbsp; The nearest benchmark is the 1891 team, coached by Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford, who coached for one season with a 4-5 mark.&nbsp; </p><p>2.&nbsp; The last years in modern times to have a two win season are 1962 (Bump Elliot) and 1958 (Bennie Oosterbann&rsquo;s last year).&nbsp; </p><p>3.&nbsp; In <a href="http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1934fbt.htm">1934</a> and <a href="http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1936fbt.htm">1936</a>, Harry Kipke coached to a 1-7 record.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://hooverstreetrag.blogspot.com/2007/11/harry-kipke-has-street-named-after-him.html">Harry Kipke has a street named after him</a>, notes the Hoover Street Rag, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1572436611/ref=sib_fs_top?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S00P&amp;checkSum=GoXlC%2BSVJfrhGaPTmGnsh3HniGYNsTaS19keqemvgqE%3D#reader-link">the late Gerald Ford was MVP of the 1934 team.&nbsp; </a>   Ford wrote a chapter in What It Means To Be A Wolverine which is worth a read about just how difficult a year that was.</p>
<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=superpatron-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=1572436611&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>So, not quite the worst season ever, but pretty close - "worst coach ever" is too soon to tell, but RichRod still needs to live up to the Bump Elliot benchmark of winning the Rose Bowl (with the 1964 team vs Oregon State).</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/michigan-footba.html">The other football benchmark is of course is Michigan football (see the season map):</a> look for a report on how the season compares to previous years next week.&nbsp; The reports I have gathered from people with parking near the stadium who always fill up is that prices don't vary much by the success of the team, but the time to sell out the lot is a lot less on a busy day.&nbsp; As you get farther from the Big House, even lower prices won't necessarily fill all the spaces.  Ann Arbor taxpayers depend on the rents from their 7x/year lawns to pay the property taxes, so we're all pulling for the team. </p>
