        <p>We've seen lots of electoral maps, with the US colored various shades of red, blue, or purple. The simplest ones just colorize the map; the most complex distort the map and refine the color space to show various aspects of the population, its voting patterns and changes over time. Jason Kottke has a good collection of 2008 election maps from all over the world, showing mostly the state of real time map software by newspapers, web sites, and television updated during the vote count. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-15-2008-election-maps-wayne-baker-on-metaphors-of-color-in-mark-newmans-cartograms/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>on time tracking, in general, an observation from last year: It&#39;s hard to have great weird ideas when you&#39;re tracking every minute to determine who it gets billed to. The cognitive overhead of deciding which part of your brain gets dinged for each good thought gets in the way of flow.

Over a period of about a month in the Spring of 2008, researchers at the University of California, San Diego and UC Berkeley sought to measure the conversion rate of spam by quietly infiltrating the Storm worm botnet, a vast collection of compromised computers once responsible for sending an estimated 20 percent of all spam. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-12-spam-analytics-how-effective-are-spam-campaigns/">&raquo;</a></p>

Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-12-describing-wiki-to-the-expert-user-of-microsoft-word/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Holiday traffic is seasonal, and we are in the post-Halloween, post-election, pre-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas season now.&#0160; Just look at the typical retail display which is already showing holiday stuff. Based on a study of the last three year&#39;s worth of traffic to this blog, here&#39;s some things you can anticipate me writing between now and the end of November, in part because I&#39;ll write it down because I need to know it, and in part because it&#39;s just that time of the year.&#0160; A wildcard that I don&#39;t have is any long experience with a political transition, so I&#39;ll throw in something in that slot. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-11-november-outlook---key-words-themes-trends/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Quite a few cafe networks have filters set up to block various kinds of use.&#0160; My usual failure modes with these are that they mark perfectly reasonable internet services as inappropriate. Here&#39;s a litany of Panera complaints, to give you a feel for it. Tinotopia was blocked for a while, which got the author riled up enough to document some of the failures.&#0160; No entries since April 2005: In this case, Tino of all people is the loser: for he has once again been suckered into coming into Panera only to find that the network is kaput. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-10-great-wall-of-panera-what-do-corporate-cafe-wifi-networks-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Along with all of the other t-shirts (Michigan Beer Pong, Michigan Undecided) for sale on State Street before football games, a new one has appeared this year:&nbsp; &ldquo;2008 Worst Season Ever&rdquo;. Not being one to quarrel with a t-shirt, I thought I&rsquo;d go back through history and see just how bad this year&rsquo;s team is compared to teams of the past. 1.&nbsp; Rich Rodriguez has the worst lifetime record (2-7) of any Michigan football coach.&nbsp; The nearest benchmark is the 1891 team, coached by Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford, who coached for one season with a 4-5 mark.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The last years in modern times to have a two win season are 1962 (Bump Elliot) and 1958 (Bennie Oosterbann&rsquo;s last year).&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; In 1934 and 1936, Harry Kipke coached to a 1-7 record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry Kipke has a street named after him, notes the Hoover Street Rag, and the late Gerald Ford was MVP of the 1934 team.&nbsp; Ford wrote a chapter in What It Means To Be A Wolverine which is worth a read about just how difficult a year that was. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-07-worst-season-ever---michigan-2008-football/">&raquo;</a></p>

Election reporting is perhaps the best reason to look at cloud computing as a system for dealing with peak load needs.&#0160; Demand for election information is very intense for a few hours, and then goes away.&#0160; Any system that you build that involves a stack of your own equipment sitting in some machine room is going to be too big for most of the time, and then too small when you need it most. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-06-election-2008-and-the-internet-lessons-learned/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Coffee House Coders is a programmer&#39;s group that meets Wednesday nights at ERC State St in Ann Arbor.&#0160; A large long table in the back hosts a dozen or so laptops, and the assembled crowd works on whatever code they are working on. Organized by Zach Steindler and Matt Pizzimenti, this group when I visited last week was mostly current and recent UM engineering students, with a few people from out of town visiting old friends.&#0160;&#0160; I saw a demo of a new product under development by Occiptal, which looked kind of like Doom set in cities, designed to run on a mobile phone.&#0160; At Coffee House Coders I learned about CouchDB, an object database which has an interesting data model - throw JSON objects into a big flat store, and retrieve them with Javascript map/reduce functions.&#0160; My favorite Django person, Brian Kerr, pointed me at a tutorial on how to implement a hierarchical database in this system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-05-coffee-house-coders-wednesdays-9pm-11pm-eastern-espresso-royale-cafe-state-st/">&raquo;</a></p>
