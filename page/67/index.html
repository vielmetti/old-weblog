<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      <p>This blog loads very, very slowly.&nbsp; (Sorry.)&nbsp; It's big, it's full of weird crap that I like to post because it's interesting, and sometimes things break because the weird crap is no longer supported.</p>

<p>If you want it to go faster look at this:</p><blockquote><p>Steve Souders book High Performance Web Sites describes the 14 best
practices he developed while working as the Chief Performance Yahoo!.
YSlow, the Firebug extension he created, codified those best practices.
Now working at Google, Steve discusses the next set of best practices
he's discovered, including the impact of iframes and where to place
(and where not to place) inline script blocks. </p></blockquote><p>and it you want to understand why web sites that are faster are better, more profitable, and more helpful for users see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596515081/?tag=superpatron-20">Andy King's Web Site Optimization</a> </p><blockquote><p>Fast display speed is the key to success with your website. It
increases profits, decreases costs, and improves customer satisfaction
(not to mention search engine rankings, accessibility, and
maintainability).
</p></blockquote><p>Here's Steve Souders talk at Google.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-26-google-adsense/">Google AdSense in professional association wikis</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Google's AdSense program is designed to provide relevant targeted advertising content to web pages.&nbsp; It works, sometimes intermittently, on weblogs - but there's often enough other non-relevant things on the design of those pages to work only indifferently.&nbsp; What you do find however is that the appropriately targeted wiki design - especially one where the subject matter expertise of a professional association is involved, and where the words in use a specific to a field of specialty - yields extremely targeted results.</p>

<p>Caution is worthwhile, however, because for every well-targeted advertising stripe you get the occasional horrible, unprofessional blunder.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some cases in point.</p>

<p><a href="http://quimica.wikispaces.com/">Quimica from the American Chemical Society</a> is running this ad on page one, hosted on Wikispaces:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/26/picture_8.png" title="Picture_8" alt="Picture_8" />


<br />Now ask yourself, what is to blame here?&nbsp; There are three ways that you can fix a problem like this of having inappropriate advertising running in your wiki.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Don't run advertising at all.&nbsp; Host your wiki yourself, or host it somewhere with an option to turn off advertising.&nbsp; Remove the risk of the accidental inappropriate Adwords ad by not using Adwords as an ad network.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Sell advertising in-house as sponsorships, or run house ads in the stripe of the page normally designed for external advertising.&nbsp; This might very reasonably be ads for things like upcoming association events, membership benefits, or other details that look like advertising targeted straight at your members.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; Use the Google AdSense ad quality as a measure of the relevance of the pages you have, and edit the wiki until the junk ads don't show up.&nbsp; Block advertisers that are inappropriate, remove page text that triggers inappropriate ads, and otherwise optimize for relevance, professionalism, and revenue.&nbsp; This works best when you are hosting a wiki on a platform and get the revenues for the advertising - some &quot;free&quot; wiki hosting really is paid for by click-throughs on ads that you are running, and if your association members are using Google Adwords to promote themselves they may well be running ads that would be very relevant on your site.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Use Google AdSense quality as a quality check on the professionalism of the AdWords advertising that your association members are running.&nbsp; From time to time, advertising copy writers at agencies will write ads that are completely inappropriate because of regulation or professional standards that they are blissfully unaware of, and by having a spot which attracts these ads you can build in feedback for professional ethics.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuckeyville.com/">Ed Stevens lives on at Stuckeyville.com</a>, though there are no plans of yet to re-release the 2000-2004 TV series on DVD.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ed.gov/index.jhtml">US Department of Education </a>is to blame for the No Child Left Behind program.</p>

<p>ed is the standard unix line editor.&nbsp; Ken wrote it, and Dennis wrote a history of it, as <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/qed.html">An Incomplete History of the QED Text Editor.</a>&nbsp; It was first written for the PDP-7.</p>

</p>
<p>It travels round the sun<br />
Six times to our one<br />
What no one else can see<br />
Is plain as day to me</p>
<p>They say its surface is hot as hell<br />
Unwitting servants to its spell<br />
You can’t flee Mercury in retrograde</p>
<p>You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury</p>
<p>It’s ten times worse than a full moon<br />
You’re not even safe in your bedroom<br />
Controls more than the rising tides<br />
There’s nowhere to hide<br />
There’s nowhere to hide</p>
<p>The gods must be against me<br />
My shortwave doesn’t work<br />
Lost signal, no connection<br />
Nothing goes right</p>
<p>Imbalance in the system<br />
Rogue planet off its track<br />
All circuits overloaded<br />
Nothing goes right</p>
<p>Damn that planet<br />
Damn that star<br />
Force of disruption from afar<br />
You can’t flee Mercury<br />
You can’t flee Mercury</p>
<p>Free from Mercury<br />
Free from Mercury</p>

      <p>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week's a2b3 meeting.&nbsp; Here are some things people shared.</p>

<p>Many people were using <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school.</p>

<p>Several of the people who used calendars to publish events for the general public talked about using an embedded Google Calendar in their blog as a quick and efficient way to share information and keep it up to date, like this one:</p>

<iframe width="400" scrolling="no" height="400" frameborder="0" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?title=a2b3%20&amp;showNav=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=400&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=8d9lpkmgltprmtbkv8p0tr39co%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York" style="border-width: 0pt;"> </iframe>

<p>A possible downside to the plethora of Google calendars is that there are literally half a dozen different otherwise indistinguishable versions of e.g. the Michigan Football schedule online, none of which can be trusted to reliably get game times right (or at least I haven't found any way to predict which one will work the best).</p>

<p>Of the non-Google online calendars, <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Calendar</a> got a vote as a family calendar, and someone was looking at <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra.</a> </p>

<p>On the work side of things, most people who were dealing with calendar systems mentioned Outlook at least once, not always with warmth and fuzziness.&nbsp; One person had Lotus Notes running, an excellent corporate calendar but one that refuses to sync or share.</p>

<p>Those people doing project management had a bias towards Microsoft Excel as a way to keep track of shared expectations about details, and one Microsoft Project user was in the room.</p>

<p>A relatively large number of people had positive things to say about synchronization of calendars to their mobile phone, more than I would have expected.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hsgconsultingllc.com/?p=86">Helene Gidley did a nice roundup of mobile device calendar syncing</a> which hits some of the high points; there's more than one way to do it, and some of them cost money.</p>

<p>Someone noted that they use <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a> to sync everything, and that everything more or less just works, and that this was remarkable enough that everything worked to make it a surprise.</p>

<p>Several people were using paper calendars as their primary daily calendar, either as a standalone calendar, a day planner style book, or a Moleskine as a GTD style capture device that got turned into calendar entries once a day.</p>

<p>I was one of two people who used a personal wiki as a diary style calendar (I use Socialtext, the other person uses Mediawiki, both set up in private one-person-wiki mode).</p>

<p>The universal shared paper calendar was the fridge calendar - if anyone wants to build a high tech fridge, just do the calendar application for it.&nbsp; This was the place where the family negotiated events and scheduling and changes and handoffs and other important timing efforts.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A friend of mine advised living a life simple enough that you could keep track of all of it on a single piece of paper; not quite there yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-coping-with-com/">Coping with community growth</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/a2b3">The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents</a> had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need.</p>

<p>The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you cope with community growth?&nbsp; In particular, if you have an organization that has regular meetings and it outstrips the capabilities of its venue, what do you do to keep it going?&nbsp; Some ideas.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Hold the meeting more frequently.&nbsp; If the monthly meeting is full every time, do a second event on alternate weeks.&nbsp; This is what movie theaters do with popular films (matinees, midnight films, 10a showings) or what busy religious congregations do.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Move the meeting from place to place.&nbsp; Some people will come if it's convenient enough, so if you move from place to place you'll get a variety of people attending who wouldn't otherwise because it's incrementally less convenient.&nbsp; <a href="http://motorcityconnect.collectivex.com/main/summary">Motor City Connect has ten meetings in eight cities around the Detroit area every month,</a> with the idea that it's going to be somewhere close to you some time.</p>

<p>3. Let the group subdivide laterally, with some part of the original collection of people doing something related at a different place and a different time.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microcoworking.com">The a2b3 group spawned (in some sense) the microcoworking group</a>, which started with one day and has expanded to three days at three different locations.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Raise the bar for participation, so that your community grows more slowly.&nbsp; At an extreme, you get new member initiation rituals that approach hazing, and so anyone who wants to stick around really wants to stick around; at the extreme, this coupled with no new member recruitment gives you groups that stop growing and start to grow old with the same people there every time.</p>

<p>5. Grow into different forms, e.g. take an offline group and put it online, or take an online group on one community platform and add it to another community platform.&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 has a very strong and functional mailing list,</a> so people don't have to be at the meetings to post a job offering or get bike repair recommendations or locate a trusted network security auditor (to give but three examples).</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; Use one group to bootstrap the creation of a new group, and then pull your energy out of the first group.&nbsp; In a religious setting this would be a <a href="http://www.joyfulheart.com/plant/splinter.htm">splinter church</a>, and just by that very name you get some sense at some possible social friction that would result.&nbsp; </p>

<p>7.&nbsp; Move your focus from local groups to national or global ones, and grow a community of practice globally rather than just locally.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?wiki_wednesdays">Wiki Wednesday meets on the first Wednesday of the month worldwide</a>; the <a href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/">Web Analytics Wednesday group</a> coordinates Wednesday meetings worldwide.&nbsp; The local meeting is probably still local, but it's part of a bigger world.</p>

<p>Some of these growth strategies yield more managable growth; others recognize that groups might just reach a happy steady state where you don't really want to multiply your size.&nbsp; </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-20-fixing-linkedin/">Fixing LinkedIn for Groups with Greasemonkey; step one, the naming of the parts</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you'd be surprised how many people apply who haven't any connection at all).</p>
<p>
The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there's no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile.&nbsp; That makes the workflow very clumsy and slow.
</p>
<p>
The fix-it-yourself approach to this is Greasemonkey, splicing in the existing code that does this feature on other parts of the site to the Admin UI page.&nbsp; for your (really, for my) reading enjoyment, here's that code. </p>

<p>Part two is causing this code to be called on another page other than the one it currently is being called!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>* js/miniprofile_popup.js */<br /><br />var miniProfile=function()<br />{var profileLinks,popContainer;<br />var responseSuccess=function(o){popContainer.getElementsByTagName('div')[0].innerHTML=o.responseText;<br />popContainer.setAttribute('hasMiniPanel','true');<br />lui.miniPanel.setBody(o.responseText);<br />addPanelEvents();<br />lui.miniPanel.move(popContainer);<br />lui.miniPanel.show();}<br /><br />var callBack={success:responseSuccess,argument:[popContainer],timeout:10000}<br /><br />var addPanelEvents=function()<br />{lui.miniPanel.addCloseEvent();<br />var actionForms=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('action-form','div',profilePanelBody);<br />if(actionForms==&quot;&quot;)return;<br />for(var i=0;actionForms.length&gt;i;i++){actionForms[i].style.display=&quot;none&quot;;}<br />var flagLink=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('action-flag','a',profilePanelBody);<br />YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(flagLink,'click',function(e){YAHOO.util.Event.preventDefault(e);<br />toggleFlagForm(actionForms);},profilePanelBody);}<br /><br />var toggleFlagForm=function(el)<br />{for(var i=0;el.length&gt;i;i++)<br />{if(el[i].style.display==&quot;block&quot;)<br />{lui.hide(el[i]);}else{lui.show(el[i]);}}}<br />return{init:function(){profileLinks=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('miniprofile-container','span','body');<br />lui.miniPanel.init(profileLinks,miniProfile.showProfile,miniProfile.fetchProfile);<br />profilePanelBody=lui.miniPanel.get();},fetchProfile:function(el){popContainer=el;<br />var url=el.className.split(' ')[1];<br />YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest('GET',url,callBack);},<br />showProfile:function(el){popContainer=el;lui.miniPanel.setBody(el.getElementsByTagName('div')[0].innerHTML);<br />addPanelEvents();<br />lui.miniPanel.move(el);<br />lui.miniPanel.show();}}}();<br /><br />miniProfile.init();</pre>

      </h3>
      <p>These are projected, estimated, possible, or likely prices for Michigan football parking for 2008.&nbsp; It's based on <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pqZp74nNK6ZunQusNTgfKfA&amp;hl=en">the dataset I collected from the 2007 football season</a>, which as you might recall had an unfortunate start (which definitely impacted prices).</p>

<p></p></p>

<p>It needs better icons so you don't have to decode the color chart.&nbsp; Typically prices can vary $5 from week to week depending on the game, and if all goes well it will rain on a Thursday so that the golf course is closed and thus neighborhood parking is at a premium.

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor Link Bus starts service again next week.&nbsp; Every year I get tired of not being able to figure out when the bus is going to show up, and this year I tried to build a new map to help out.&nbsp; This is a work in progress.</p>

<p>The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I'll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.&nbsp; So the Y stop becomes an 11 stop, since the bus is supposed to get there at 11 26 41 56.</p>

<p>Google Maps now has a way to do custom icons, and I'm using letters from a Unicode alphabet to get the circled numbers.&nbsp; A few glitches still until I host those icons locally.&nbsp; It's hard to get the icons located precisely right at all scales and resolutions, don't know how to fix that (short of actually doing paste up on a paper map).</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.homelessdave.com">Dave Askins</a> is contributing a set of icons for the stop markers - the &ldquo;9&rdquo; stop there is the new and improved, which allows for better stop locating.</p>

      <p>We're back from a summer vacation on Cape Cod, and now it's time for back to school.&nbsp; Ann Arbor makes a very rapid transition from summer town to college town in the span of about 72 hours, and it's just about time for everything to change.</p>

<p>You know it's time for school to start when the next projects on your fun list are the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/link-bus-2008-m.html">new Link Bus schedule</a>, the football parking prices map, the 3d grade start of school picnic and the daycare potluck.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm still writing the Superpatron weblog, and working on an article on mobile versions of library catalogs, so that when you're on the go you can look up a book or when you're in the library you can remember what you were there for.</p>

<p>Really new for me this year is a fresh interest in law school - Deb starts at Wayne State Law today, and so there will be a lot more law related stuff to be aware of.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a sneaking suspicion that means a new blog, just to pull that stuff all to one place, since I'll bet there will be two posts a day to write about that experience if I choose to.</p>

      <p>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I've told you once, I've told you 146 times: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22repetition+is+the+very+soul+of+the+net%22">repetition is the very soul of the net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a> is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.&nbsp; His 1992 masters thesis, <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm">Optimization of Learning</a>, covered the early work on Supermemo and a discussion of spaced repetition in learning.</p>

<p>I've been using some of the principles from SuperMemo, in particular the discussion of<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/paper.htm"> using SuperMemo without a computer</a>, to structure some organized retrospective looks at what I have been interested in over time and also to trigger follow up contacts with people and ideas that would have otherwise been forgotten.&nbsp; The important element of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> is used not to remember facts and figures but to trigger memory of people and the context I saw them in.&nbsp; The idea is that you structure a process to revisit previous days efforts - more recent days more frequently, and old days less frequently - and use that memory jogger to keep you connected.</p>

<p>What makes this newly easy (or at least easier) is some combination of tools and search engines not originally available in 1987, combined with my existing frequent blogging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me provide two examples, with some source code.</p>

<p>I keep a personal wiki with a page for each day.&nbsp; This is actually the second of those I have tried doing - the first was on custom pre-release versions of the Socialtext software and I reanimated it on the current Socialtext hosted platform.&nbsp; The notion is that you have a wiki page named &quot;2008 August 12&quot;, or really one page possible for every day, and you take notes on or about that day there or link to it to refer to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;There's a little bit of code that I wrote to make links from that page to a series of days spaced in the past and future which I include as a block on that page, making it easy to hyperlink forwards and backwards in time.&nbsp; That's good, as far as I do have things in my personal wiki (though maintaining that every day is a burden and I often have big blank spots when the burden of diligence is too great).</p>

<p>The second and more immediately practical approach uses search engines to replace explicit page dates to slice up the world into punctuated time slices.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use this with my weblog, creating searches like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Avielmetti.typepad.com+%22August+12%2C+2007%22">site:vielmetti.typepad.com &quot;August 12, 2007&quot;</a><br />to methodically revisit the past.&nbsp; As I said, it helps if you post daily, or have a tool like the delicious.com tag poster to do it for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The code I wrote which I'll share is based on &quot;day.sh&quot; which I released some time ago.&nbsp; That tool prints the date a specified time in the past; this new tool, &quot;<a href="http://monkey.org/~emv/src/spaced-days.tar">spaced-days</a>&quot;, creates a series of days formatted appropriately for whatever you want to paste them into.&nbsp; The sample I have generates Socialtext formatted wiki pages but minor edits will generate Mediawiki pages and more major ones could make HTML with the formatted searches above.</p>

<p>So if I'm thinking about my cousin's wedding two years ago, or next year's St Urho's Day celebrations, or the Burns Park Run for 2009, it's because there was just enough reminders to jog 1/n of my memory and not the whole darn thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>UPDATE: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/michigan-2008-election-results.html">Michigan election results for the November 2008 general election</a>, if you came here from a search.</p>

<p>The polls have closed, and results are just starting to trickle in at 8:30pm.   Here's some places to look for data.  (update: it's the next day and the votes are tallied)</p>

<p>The Michigan Secretary of State has <a href="http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/08PRI/">2008 Unofficial Michigan Primary Election Results</a> for all state-wide races, state senators and representatives, and judicial races. They also have links to <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1633_8722-103241--,00.html">Michigan primary election results by county</a> connected to almost all of the county clerk sites maintained around the state.</p>

<p>In Washtenaw County, there's a page with <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/indexreport.html">unofficial Washtenaw County election results for August 2008</a>, including <A href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/cumulativereport.html">cumulative results</a> and a breakdown by race.  Notable contested races are the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport382.html">Democratic primary Washtenaw Sheriff</a> election, and the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport544.html">15th District Judge</a> race.   The <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/08/roundup_of_results_in_washtena.html">Ann Arbor News has a roundup of results.</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oakgov.com/crts0006/controller">Oakland County non-partisan and proposal ballot results</a> include a proposal for a tax to support the zoo, which passed.   The <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080806/NEWS15/80806019">Detroit Free Press has complete 2008 August election results</a>.</p>

<p>All of the <a href="http://www.co.marquette.mi.us/clerk/results-1.htm">2008 Marquette County August primary</a> results are on one page.  (Two friends from high school are both running for judge.)  I expect to see <A href="http://www.miningjournal.net/">voting results at the Marquette Mining Journal</a>, but nothing there as of 9am Weds.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/DavidHelwig">David Helwig</a> (twitter) is covering the <a href="http://sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=33725">Chippewa County</a> elections for <a href="http://sootoday.com">SooToday</a>.</p>

<p>More details as anything is notable.  </p>

<p>Several newspapers have coverage with Twitter - the <a href="http://twitter.com/a2snooze">Ann Arbor News</a> has an (ahem) unofficial feed, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mlive">mLive</a> does some state-wide coverage.  Other newspaper twitters are dead including the Flint Journal and the Detroit Free Press.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cookingdebauchery.com/cooking_debauchery/2006/09/blueberrybuffal.html">Blueberry buffalo stew</a> from Cooking Debauchery, via merathena on LJ:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The blueberries melt into the stock producing the most delectable, mahogany colored broth and a fragrance the fills the house with the scents of fall. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>We're vegetarians at home, so this is going to have to be someone else's potluck dish.  There's buffalo raised in Michigan at <a href="http://www.sprikfarms.com/">Sprik Farms</a> near Grand Rapids, and at <a href="http://www.tmzfarm.com/">TMZ Farm</a> near Pinckney.</p>

<p><b>Blueberry-Buffalo Stew</b></p>

<p>1 ½ - 2 pounds buffalo, beef, or lamb stew meat<br />
1 cup blueberries<br />
4 cups chicken or beef stock<br />
2 tablespoons canola oil (or bacon drippings)<br />
1 ½ tablespoons honey<br />
3 tablespoons dry sherry (optional)<br />
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br />
Salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p>Cut the meat into one inch chunks and season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Heat a large Dutch oven or stew pot.  Drizzle in oil or bacon dripping to coat the bottom.  Working in batches, brown the meat well on all sides.  Add oil as necessary.  Do not over crowd the pan.  Remove browned meat to a clean dish and cover.</p>

<p>Once all the meat is browned, return it all to the pan with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.  Add stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and skim off any froth that has collected on the surface until the broth is clear.  Add the blueberries, honey, sherry, and cayenne pepper and bring back to a boil.</p>

<p>Simmer for 2 hours or until the meat is very tender and the broth has reduced.  Stir occasionally.  This helps to break up the blueberries and incorporate them into the liquid.  By the end of the cooking time the blueberries should be completely incorporated.</p>

<p>Serve with crusty bread and salad.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The primaries in Michigan are tomorrow, August 5 2008.</p>

<p>If you want a sample ballot, go to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/vote">Michigan Voter Information Center</a> run by the Michigan Secretary of State.  You'll put in your voter information, and it will come up with a list of elections on the ballot.  <a href="http://publius.org">Publius also generates Michigan sample ballots</a>, as does the <a href="http://thevoterguide3.mlive.com/?sfr">MLive Voter Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/elections/el_precincts.html">Washtenaw County precinct locations</a> is kept by the County Clerk and Register of Deeds, Larry Kestenbaum.  He's running unopposed for re-election.  </p>

<p>I'll be voting again this year using the AUTOMARK machine set up for vision impaired voters.  My notes from last time <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">show the problems I had with the AUTOMARK machine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Note for next time: vote early (and vote often), and tear the stub off before inserting the ballot into the AutoMARK machine, despite all of the instructions to the contrary.
</blockquote>

<p>My experience with AutoMARK is not unique - here's this season's clippings of people with problems:</p>

<p>Nassau County, NY: from the <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/NYSTEC-Finds-NY-SBOE-Votin-by-Rady-Ananda-080711-393.html">OpEd News</a> site (some political blog)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Nassau County purchased 450 ballot marking devices (BMDs) from Sequoia, at a cost of $12,000 each.  It reported that 85% of 240 machines were non-functional, one fifth of them damaged during shipment.  New York City also experienced software failure, when it tested ES&S AutoMARK's BMD, as attested at the June 23rd NYC Government Services Committee, reported Nassau County Attorney Lori Barrett.   </p>

<p>Ballot marking devices allow disabled voters to vote independently, printing the ballot for them, and would fulfill NY's compliance with the Help America Vote Act.  Yet a substantial portion of BMDs received in Nassau registered a printer failure.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>San Francisco is sold uncertified AutoMARK systems: from <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/elections_index.asp?id=70865">the San Francisco Department of Elections</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
On August 21, 2007, the Secretary of State announced a public hearing to examine ES&S's sale of uncertified AutoMARK machines to five California counties, including San Francisco.  In April 2006, San Francisco purchased 565 AutoMARKs from ES&S for $6,185.89 per machine, paying a total purchase price of nearly $3.5 million.  Unbeknownst to San Francisco at the time of the purchase, and as later reported by the Secretary of State, these 565 machines (as well as 407 AutoMARKs sold to other California counties) were uncertified.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after receiving the Secretary of State's statement, the Director of Elections confirmed that the voting machines ES&S sold San Francisco in April 2006 for use in the June 2006 and subsequent elections were the uncertified AutoMARK Model A200 machines.  But at the time of the sale, ES&S represented to San Francisco that it was providing AutoMARK Model A100 machines, which had been previously certified by the Secretary of State in August 2005, roughly seven months prior to San Francisco's purchase.  In fact, the machines ES&S provided were AutoMARK Model A200 machines, which had not been certified by the Secretary of State.  Unaware that ES&S's representations that the machines were certified were false, San Francisco unwittingly used what turned out to have been uncertified AutoMARK ballot marking machines in both the June 2006 and November 2006 elections. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Ed Felten's Freedom to Tinker blog on <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1269">California review of the ES&S AutoMARK and M100</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Yet still, they note that “We are not aware of any public device that has more flexibility in accommodating the wide range of physical and dexterity abilities that voters may have. The key, as always, is whether pollworkers and voters will be able to identify and implement the optimal input system without better guidance or expert support. In fact, it may be that the more flexible a system is, the more difficult it is for novices to navigate through the necessary choices for configuring the access options in order to arrive at the best solution.” One of their most striking findings was how long it took test subjects to use the system. Audio-only voters needed an average of almost 18 minutes to use the machine on a simplified ballot (minimum 10 minutes; maximum 35 minutes). Write-in votes were exceptionally difficult. And, again, this is arguably one of the best voting systems available, at least from an accessibility perspective.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Vote early (you might need the extra time!)</p>

      <p>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota.  From a <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/article.do?rid=189603">profile of Jim Johnson</a> by writer <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/artistHome.do?rid=11865">Cheryl Reitan</a> in the <a href="http://www.mnartists.org">mnartists.org</a> site:</p>

<blockquote>
JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.
</blockquote>

<p><b>In The Blueberry Bucket (from A Field Guide to Blueberries)</b><br />
<blockquote><br />
A man picks blueberries all day. In the bucket<br />
small green and withered sifting down,<br />
too old and squashed against the sides,<br />
twigs leave spruce needles settled to the bottom<br />
while the large ripe rise up to the top.<br />
So full of flesh, so ordinary?<br />
a woman, at sunset<br />
a blond woman leading a reindeer<br />
across the horizon. You are that woman. I am that man.<br />
And this I give to you<br />
is, if not the history of the world<br />
at the end of the day, but<br />
a bucketful of blueberries.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In blueberry picking news, we were at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">the Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> yesterday (August 2 2008) and picked a good quantity of berries - the big commercial high bush berries which are easier to fill buckets with, even if you are the only one picking and your traveling companions are mostly eating.</p>

<p><blockquote>
Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. &ldquo;It has the string sound of a viola,&rdquo; Kallet says, &ldquo;and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it&rsquo;s small enough that I can handle it easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the pieces on the record possess elements of Scandinavian melody and harmony, yet remain Balkan in rhythm.</p>

<p>"Cindy and I love to play Swedish and Norwegian traditional fiddle tunes in which the fiddlers play in harmony with each other," Larsen says. "It's a beautiful sound, and you can get four-part harmonies going with just two people."<br />
