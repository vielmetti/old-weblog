<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of
maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department
of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they
cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility
company. I know it won&rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies
have at least one county that they only provide service to part
of), but as a start it&rsquo;s a pretty good one.</p>

<p>The DOE data is based on their Form EIA-861, and I&rsquo;m working from
the 2013 data set. See <a
href="http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/">Electric power
sales, revenue, and energy efficiency Form EIA-861 detailed data
files</a> if you want to get your own files. It&rsquo;s provided as Excel
(XLSX) files, so you&rsquo;ll need something compatible to read them; I
ended up using <a
href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/in2csv.html">in2csv
from csvkit</a> as the first part of the pipeline to break these
apart.</p>

<p>You get lines from the provided file that look like this:</p>

<pre>
Data Year,Utility Number,Utility Name,State,County
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Shiawassee
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,St Clair
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Tuscola
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Washtenaw
2013,5109,DTE Electric Company,MI,Wayne
</pre>

<p>The next challenge is to pull a map for each county served. To do this, convert the (State,County) list to a FIPS code, using a table like this one from ORNL called <a href="http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/CoFIPS00.txt">CoFIPS00.txt</a>. (MI,Washtenaw) turns into 26161. Feed a list of FIPS codes into the Census Reporter geo API, and out comes GeoJSON files, like so: <a href="http://api.censusreporter.org/1.0/geo/show/tiger2013?geo_ids=05000US26103,05000US26003">GeoJSON for Marquette and Alger Counties, Michigan</a>. </p>

<p>We have a list of counties for each utility, so at minimum we're set right there. But we need to get 2935 of them, and it's kind of slow to wait for each one to return before fetching the next one. That motivates the use of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU Parallel</a>, a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel. On my four core MacBook Air I ran 32 jobs in parallel, and 2935 fetches (using "curl") took 287 seconds with the median elapsed time for each job at about 3 seconds - about a 31x speedup vs doing things serially.</p>

<p>However, the GeoJSON provided is really one shape per county, and we're looking for a complete service area in a single shape, so we need to merge the result together. Here a useful tool is the "R" stats package, particularly the "rgeos", "rgdal", and "maptools" packages. </p>

<p>The first step is the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/ogrInfo">readOGR() function from the rgdal library</a>. It takes a variety of input map formats including GeoJSON and shape files and pulls them into a Spatial vector object in R. rgdal is an R interface to Frank Warmerdam's <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a>, and it handles both raster and vector geospatial data formats.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/maptools/docs/unionSpatialPolygons">unionSpatialPolygons() function from the maptools library</a> to merge the county polygons into a single polygon. The docs say that this is a wrapper around the <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gUnion">gUnion() function from the rgeos library</a>. rgeos comes from the Google Summer of Code 2010, and this <a href="https://gsoc2010r.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/rgeos-introduction/">introduction to the project</a> explains the motivation. rgeos provides an R interface to <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/">GEOS</a>, which is in turn a C++ port of <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/main.html">JTS</a>, the Java Topology Suite.</p>

<p>After you run the unionSpatialPolygons() operation, you will inevitably find that there are tiny holes in your unioned map. Geographic boundaries are complex, and as a result there are often little areas that don't quite touch, leaving little bits of land that aren't included anywhere. This algorithm from stackoverflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12663263/dissolve-holes-in-polygon-in-r">Dissolve holes in polygon in R</a>, takes care of the issue. </p>

<pre>
G.rings = Filter(function(f){f@ringDir==1},G.union@polygons[[1]]@Polygons)
G.bounds = SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(G.rings,ID=1)))
</pre>

<p>As the Polygon documentation note for ringDir: "the ring direction of the ring (polygon) coordinates, holes are expected to be anti-clockwise"</p>

<p>Having done this cleanup work, we return a GeoJSON file with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/leafletR/functions/toGeoJSON">toGeoJSON() function from the leafletR package</a>. Now I probably don't need to pull in all of leafletR; there's a <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgdal/docs/writeOGR">writeOGR() function in the rgdal package</a> that should also do the same work. The aside, though, is that <a href="https://github.com/chgrl/leafletR">leafletR</a> creates nice maps in R using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> Javascript library.</p>

<p>With all that done, we have a new GeoJSON file that's a cleaned up merge of multiple county outlines done in R. However, the process isn't quite done. Some of the merged files don't have holes, but they do have "slivers", little angular bits of geometry from where two counties don't quite touch at their corners. I didn't find an algorithm to unsliver in R, but this <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/120286/removing-small-polygons-gaps-in-a-shapely-polygon">Removing small polygons gaps in a Shapely polygon</a> did the trick. </p>

<pre>
# Here's the algorithm
fx = poly.buffer(eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre).buffer(-eps, 1, join_style=JOIN_STYLE.mitre)
</pre>

<p><a href="http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html">Shapely</a> from Sean Gilles is a "Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using (via Python’s ctypes module) functions from the well known and widely deployed GEOS library." So we're back to GEOS, which is also supported by R...which means I suspect this algorithm translates directly back into R by proper invocation of the equivalent <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/rgeos/docs/gBuffer">gBuffer() function from the rgeos package</a>.</p>

<p>No matter, I installed Shapely. It's pretty fast, and if I had time to refine this operation I'd try to port all of the R code back into python using Shapely to see if I could get a meaningful speedup improvement.</p>

<p>All this description! Here's the code.</p>

</pre>

<p>So, progress.</p>

<p>One process, written in python, takes an Excel file provided by the county and creates a GeoJSON file from it. Addresses in the file are geocoded. The original file has a set of restaurant inspection reports and three kinds of inspection problems found; I add a fourth "score" variable that's derived in some way from those three.</p>

<p>A second process (code above) is in R using the LeafletR graphing package. It in turn takes the GeoJSON file as originally provided, and writes an HTML file that reads it using the Leaflet maps package.</p>

<p>A screenshot of the result is below:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" title="Screen Shot 2015-03-02 at 12.56.42 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7572bc9970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Some big caveats.</p>

<p>My color palette is all wrong - I need to think that through. </p>

<p>This process is based on a single monthly Excel file, and should be updated to include all recent inspections and not just a single month.</p>

<p>The map needs labels of some sort. (How they will look when everything is smushed together, don't know.)</p>

<p>It would be nice to have HTML links to the Arborwiki page for each restaurant, and to a deep link for the inspections itself.</p>

<p>The geocoder is a bit slow, and I should cache previous results so that it goes faster in future months.</p>

<p>RESTAURANT NAMES ARE IN ALL CAPS AND THAT'S SHOUTING.</p>

<p>Leaflet can do all sorts of things and I've hardly scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I probably could do this all in R - or all in Python - but I'm trying to spin up on both systems &amp; thus really want to use each for what they are good at.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don't ask me why.) Here's some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more.</p>

<p>First, some prior art. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Tactile-Feedback-Compass-Belt/">How to make a tactile compass feedback belt</a> is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt. When you're pointing in a certain direction, the belt vibrates in that spot, and you get a continuous sense of direction. <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/esp.html">Wired Magazine wrote this up in 2007</a>, and the invention of the "feelSpace belt" is credited to Osnabrück cognitive scientist Peter König. Here's a CBC interview with Peter König from 2014.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.cbc.ca/i/caffeine/syndicate/?clipId=2626883935" width="620" height="348" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If you look at the designs for these magnetic belts, you quickly discover that the electronics to detect direction are relatively straightforward, and that there are lots of wires and buzzers that you have to harness together. So the question I have is whether there's a better way to encode direction that doesn't require a dozen motors! You'd think that you could use a code on a single vibrotactile device to "tap out" a direction, or use a pair of devices to encode "northiness" and "eastiness" to give the whole code with two points instead of a dozen. There would be a training time to learn this, and it might be less obvious than a single motor pointing north. The evident advantage of the two-motor approach over the twelve-motor approach is that the wearable device could be very small.</p>

<p>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it's cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate.</p>

<p>I thought I'd use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch.</p>

<p>The setup:</p>

<p>Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag. I'm using RabbitMQ as my MQTT message passing system, but that's not strictly necessary for this application.</p>

<p>The Macbook has support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which is what the Sensortag talks. Support for BLE in Node-RED is provided by the "noble" module, which the "sensortag" module uses to communicate with the device. Freeboard is a visualization dashboard with some simple widgets to display data coming to it.</p>

<p>This report on <a href="https://gist.github.com/dceejay/fb47301b759222e05f84">how to use the Freeboard dashboard with Node-RED</a> has all of the difficult parts. It provides a websocket listener for Freeboard, and you use the built-in websocket transmitter on Node-RED. There's a very tiny bit of logic to pull apart the data coming off the Sensortag; it could probably be less if I were more clever.</p>

<p>The Node-RED code looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 10.00.33 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb07e40ac5970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>and the very simple dashboard I put together to test this looks like this</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 9.07.09 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0c9e228970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>There's a catch to using the TI Sensortag; it sometimes turns itself off, to save battery. To correct this you can install new firmware on the device to disable the battery saving mode. The folks at MyWeatherCenter provide a <a href="http://www.myweathercenter.net/installing-a-new-firmware-for-ti-sensortag/">link to their firmware</a> which deals with the issue, at the cost of lower battery life. </p>

<p>The results: the windows are way, way colder than the inside air (about 45 degrees), but the curtains read much warmer (about 60 degrees). Thermal curtains for the win!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-12-vellum-a-downtown-ann-arbor-restaurant-has-closed/">Vellum, a downtown Ann Arbor restaurant, has closed</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/01/downtown_ann_arbors_vellum_to.html">Ann Arbor News story</a> tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.</p>

<p>What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. County health officials took a dim view of this, as seen in this excerpt from a <a href="http://www.healthinspection.info/establishments/1364">health inspection in February 2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Critical) Found a package of meat in a vacuum sealed package, and found beef short rib in a vacuum sealed package in the basement meat walk in cooler. These packages were the same size as the vacuum package supply in facility, and did not appear to be commercial products as there were no labels and pic could not provide any statements or boxes indicating from a commercial licensed source. Pic corrected by discarding meats in vacuum sealed packages. Found a piece of meat in a vacuum sealed package with " 140 degrees 4 and half hours" written on package in the walk in cooler. Pic states he does not know what marking mean and where this came from. Pic corrected by discarding meat. Found several pieces of sous vide equipment in the basement and main kitchen areas. Found at least 5 boxes of packages for vacuum packaging on the shelf in the basement prep area, and was denied access to room/closet next to shelf with vacuum packaging. To correct verify that no one in facility is using vacuum sealer or preparing food using sous vide method as a variance is required. This violation has repeated and a risk control plan is required to be submitted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your innovative kitchen depends on methods that are in violation of regulations, it's going to be hard to keep up the buzz when you have to give them up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.</p>

<p>Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.</p>

<p>The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. Expect the neighborliness issue to be a substantial point of discussion.</p>

<p>The downtown zoning plans revolve around the changes proposed to what's now a parking lot next to the DTE building on S Main St. The parcel abuts a residential neighborhood and the neighbors don't particularly want a giant building to the west looming over their back yards.</p>

<p>On the consent agenda is approval of an emergency repair to the city's tower truck in the sum of $64,464.93 which is to repair damage from an accident on October 31, 2014. The fire department has brought its 18 year old previous tower unit back into service in reserve, according to the city administrator's notes accompanying the purchase order approval request.</p>

<p>Council will take up the issue of rezoning of a parcel at 3601 Plymouth Road to allow the construction of a Plum Market on the land most recently occupied by Cleary University.</p>

<p>It should be an early night at council.</p>

<p>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti
Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a
little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic
cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing
functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65
pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into
the machine.</p>

<p>Graveraet Middle School in Marquette had one of these, presumably
discarded from its use in the school administration. By 1977 the
machine was so completely obsolete that it sat idle, with no one
knowing how it worked. I got plenty of time to spend with the system,
and frankly I never really figured it out either. It was easy enough
to use it as an adding and multiplying and dividing machine, but
the mysteries of its program logic escaped me.</p>

<p>There are several folks who have active projects to restore the old
system, including a project at the DataMuseum in Denmark. <a
href="http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Olivetti/Programma_101/Revive">See their
efforts here.</a> There are quite a lot of mechanical parts in this
old machine, including a set of 8 pulleys that drove the various
bits of the card reader and the printer. Rubber rollers of course
get old and decayed with time so every account of a restoration has
some discussion of that repair.</p>

Spain, who outlines the use of the Programma 101 <a

      <p>As of this writing (2 am Sunday December 28 2014 in Ann Arbor MI) there is no word on the fate of the lost airliner Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 which went missing on a flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. </p>

<p>Trying to find reliable information about an event in progress half way around the world is always a challenge. Twitter and Facebook are good at moving information quickly around the globe, but they send sense and nonsense in equal parts, and it's easy to read things that are speculation or even outright falsehoods.</p>

<p>Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_AirAsia_Flight_8501">Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501</a> warns "Initial news reports may be unreliable". At the moment the page is up to date with as much of the fragments of news that have been made available, and it links to "unconfirmed and speculative early reports" that speak of wreckage being found.</p>

<p>Much less reputable are the reports of Russia Today and China's CCTV which take rumor as fact.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every month I get an email with a spreadsheet of restaurant inspection reports from Washtenaw County. Here's a summary of the worst (and best) of the restaurants inspected in November 2014.</p>

<p>There are three types of problems reported by county health. To simplify reporting I score them proportionately to see which locations go to the top of the list. </p>

<p>6 locations had no problems at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>DOG DAYS III  2515 JACKSON    ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>DOMINICK'S    812 MONROE  ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>HOTEL HICKMAN WILD WEST ADVENTURES STFU   2400 HICKMAN RD ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>JIMMY JOHN'S GOURMET SANDWICHES   342 S. STATE STREET ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>OCED SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM 2025 E. CLARK ROAD  YPSILANTI</li>
<li>WETZEL'S PRETZELS 100 BRIARWOOD CIRCLE K108   ANN ARBOR</li>
</ul>

<p>By far and away the worst restaurant is Tim Horton's on 760 S Hewitt Rd in Ypsilanti, with 9 priority violations, 8 priority foundation violations, and 14 core violations. 
This sums it up (all caps in original)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL IS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED IN THE FACILITY AS EVIDENCED BY EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY HANDWASHING, EMPLOYEES ARE MONITORING FOOD TEMPERATURES, PROPERLY WASHING AND SANITIZING CLEANED MULTIUSE EQUIPMENT AND UTENSILS BEFORE THEY ARE REUSED, MONITORING DISHWASHING PROCEDURES. BASED ON NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OCCURRING WITHIN THESE FOOD CODE CATEGORIES ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL IS NOT OCCURRING ON A REGULAR BASIS. CORRECT BY RETRAIN MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FOOD CODE AND PROVIDE TOOLS FOR MONITORING CLEANING, TEMPERATURES ETC FOR MANAGER TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE. ,</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tim-hortons-ypsilanti">Yelp reviews for this place</a> share some of the horrors.</p>

<p>Bill S.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disgusting - worst sandwich I have ever purchased in my life. Dried out chicken that tasted like it bad been sitting around for 3 days. Threw it out after 2 bites. Would have asked for a refund but didn't want to deal with the aggravated and stressed out staff running the place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mia M: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, the same person is running the drive thru window. She's rude and I overhear conversations that make me question the cleanliness inside the restaurant. "Grab a wet rag and pretend you wiped down the tables." "Put a towel on it and we'll clean it up later." Or my personal favorite, "We're out of coffee [and it's 8 o'clock in the morning.]" </p>

      </h3>
      <p>From Scientific American, [For Sale: “Your Name Here” in a Prestigious Science Journal] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. "Begger's funnel plot" appears to be an accidental hybrid of the two names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem? A steep rise in the number of "meta-analysis" papers published in China, many of which seem to be following a common template for reporting results - including sharing typographic errors, mis-attribution, and formulaic text. </p>

<p>The best ongoing reporting on dishonesty in the scientific literature is <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> from Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus. Filion's post on <a href="http://blog.thegrandlocus.com/2014/10/a-flurry-of-copycats-on-pubmed">A flurry of copycats on PubMed</a> digs deeper into the problem, studying the copycat formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real shock came when we downloaded the papers. Most are behind paywalls, so we could access only 25 of them. There was no need for more, the pattern was very clear from the third study. The papers have exactly the same structure, with the same figures in the same order. The last figure of each paper is a “Begger’s funnel plot”, featuring a surrealistic fusion of Begg and Egger (Colin Begg and Matthias Egger both gave their name to a test for publication bias). What struck me the most was the similarity in the aesthetics of the figures, the same line widths, the same colors, the same shapes etc.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.</p>

<p>The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. Note that broadcasts in English are not 24 hours a day, and that shortwave reception varies widely by time of day and location of receiving station.</p>

<p>The key to do this is to acquaint yourself with <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a>, a project that allows multiple listeners to tune into the signal of a single wideband radio. You'll need to pick a receiver that has an antenna that covers the appropriate part of the broadcast band, and you'll need also a schedule for when the station is broadcasting.</p>

<p>Many shortwave schedules and stations can be located via <a href="http://www.short-wave.info/">short-wave.info</a>.  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" title="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Given a schedule and a frequency, use WebSDR to find a suitable listening location. My two favorites for monitoring Havana are the original <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">WedSDR at U Twente</a> and <a href="http://96.225.100.244:8902/">K2SDR in New Jersey</a>. </p>

<p>Of course you can tune in via <a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Havana-Cuba-p1687/">TuneIn</a> and get to the broadcast direct. The sound will be more clear, and the reception more reasonable. But there's really something to be said for experiencing broadcast radio through the medium of radio rather than this newfangled Internet thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Dr. Dobb's Journal is closing down, with its last issue appearing at the end of 2014. They <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">tell their story</a> in a final report.</p>

<p>The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side, our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My memory of reading Dr. Dobb's dates back to the early 1990s, when it was a source for careful writing (complete with source code) on programming issues of the day. Now days there's an infinite supply of technical writing on the net, so it's not surprising that ad revenues dried up (or more pointedly got concentrated on Google the gatekeeper for much of online traffic).</p>

<p>"Running light without overbyte" was their first slogan. You can pick up a first edition of their compiled first year of publication (1976) from <a href="http://www.kuenzigbooks.com/pages/books/22185/dr-dobb/dr-dobbs-journal-of-computer-calisthenics-orthodontia-running-light-without-overbyte-volume-one">Kuenzig Books</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.</p>

<p>websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. There are websdr servers running around the globe, each tuned in to some particular slice of the radio waves. Multiple people can tune in at the same time and hear their own piece of the airwaves.</p>

<p>The interesting thing happens when you connect these two systems together. Some small number of the websdr receivers tune into the 2 meter band, which is the typical band used by Echolink. Using Echolink (or in my case the Mac application Echomac) I identified an Echolink host in the vicinity of the websdr receiver, then connected to it. Sure enough, I was able to hear my call sign back in through the websdr front end.</p>

<p>This little image shows the result. Transmitted via DM0ZHS, and monitored at http://129.187.5.188:8901/ on 145237.50 kHz, I'm sending from Isen, Germany and receiving the transmission at the Olympic Tower in Munich, Germany.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gall, John C. 9/18/1925 - 12/15/2014 Walker, MN John C. Gall, Jr.,
beloved husband, father, pediatrician, scholar and author, passed
away with his wife by his side Dec. 15, 2014, in Walker, MN, from
natural causes. He was 89. John was born on September 18, 1925 in
Washington, D.C. and grew up near Upperville, VA. In 1945 he was
drafted into the Army Air Corps and sent to Germany, where he served
as a medic in the Allied army of occupation. During his tour of
duty he attended the Nuremberg trials, which kindled in him a
lifelong passion to heal the afflicted and promote justice. Upon
returning home he furthered his education, graduating from Yale and
George Washington University Medical School. He was a postdoctorate
fellow at the Mayo Clinic, where he was dubbed &ldquo;the best pediatric
diagnostician [they had] ever seen!&rdquo; In addition he earned a
certification in Human Genetics and completed 7 years of therapy
training. Dr. Gall began his medical career as a researcher at the
University of Virginia, followed by a 3-year stint at the Geisinger
Clinic in Danville, PA. He next went into private practice in Miles
City, MT, but was soon invited to teach at the University of Michigan
Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. There he also served as head of
the Plymouth State Home, where he did research partially funded by
the Kennedy family foundation, and named and described several
syndromes of the developmentally disabled . In addition he established
a long-running private pediatric practice of 38 years. During this
period he developed a special appreciation for, and an enduring
interest in, the importance of nonverbal communication between very
young children and their parents. This led him to expand his practice
to include support and education classes, in which he was aided by
his late wife, Beth, and then by his wife Carol. Their observations
and anecdotes are included in Elegant Parenting, written with wife,
Beth; in Dancing with Elves written by John, and with wife Carol
he wrote Hit by a Low-Flying Goose. John&rsquo;s best known book is System
Antics, later published under the title The Systems Bible, a humorous
but insightful study of the problems and pitfalls that afflict every
type of system that human beings create-whether mechanical, economic,
corporate, aeronautical, legal, linguistic, religious, medical or
electronic. It was first published in 1976 by the New York
Times/Quadrangle Press and has been translated (officially or
unofficially) into at least 14 languages. He lectured widely
throughout the United States and was interviewed by the Voice of
America on nuclear proliferation issues after its publication. John
and Carol were both invited to speak in London in 2012 to a group
of CEOs and other executives from around the world and John was
introduced as &ldquo;The Grandfather of Systems Theory.&rdquo; He retired to
Walker, MN, in 2001 in search of privacy and uninterrupted time,
which he used to write seven other books, including a novel, First
Queen, plus books and video books on parenting and the art of
pediatric practice. He was very proud that the great Swiss psychiatrist,
Alice Miller, who introduced the world to the subject of child
sexual abuse, endorsed his work before she died. His work has also
been endorsed by others too numerous to name, but including such
luminaries as the head of the Dept. of Psychology at Cambridge,
University, who forwarded his material to several British social
service agencies. In the late 1990s John helped to write the National
Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Exam in Washington D.C several years
running. More recently he was invited to Washington D.C. by a
government psychiatrist and consulted with this man on the development
of psychological profiles of moles (double agents). He also spoke
at a symposium at Princeton University entitled &ldquo;Children under the
Shadow of War.&rdquo; The group included scholars from around the world,
and filmmakers who had photographed kidnapped children who had been
conscripted into war and forced to commit atrocities. It was John&rsquo;s
job to deliver the final speech, summarizing and tying together all
of the presentations. This was the only lecture open to the public.
John gave a moving presentation that left not a dry eye in the
audience. In the final months of his life, John continued to think
and write actively on a wide range of subjects. Most recently he
completed a 4th edition of Systemantics and contributed, with other
international scholars, to a book on Panarchy, due to be published
in 2015. John was preceded in death by his first wife, Beth, and
three step-grandsons, Michael Nelson, and Franklin and Alexander
Sawvel. His is survived by his wife, Carol, brothers Dr. Joseph
Gall (Diane Dwyer) and Howard, sons Duane (Valerie) and David
(Suzette), step-sons Steven (Sarah) and Terrell (Eleanor) Nelson,
and grandchildren Izzie, Nathan, Sebastian, and Simone, plus
step-grandchildren Anthony, Cody, Alaya, Nicole, and Branden Nelson.
A private family ceremony will be held in the Episcopal Church in
Upperville, VA, in the late spring.  -</p>

<p>I tried to do this <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">back in 2008</a> when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates.</p>

<p>I have a few bots that tweet out weather updates which I guess I will keep running because it's more trouble than it's worth to temporarily turn them off. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out
that the routine I have with Google's Gmail for handling inbound
correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail
to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.</p>

<p>I don't know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect,
but it seems to be pretty good. Email comes in, I read it, and anything
that deserves further attention but can't be handled right away is
starred. The next round of handling works its way through the starred 
messages, and when something in that queue is stuck and needs more
attention than I can get to at the moment it goes into a Github issue.
Periodically I work through Github, sort out some priority items,
and try to crank through the queues. </p>

<p>The problem with systems is that they periodically fail. My system works
OK as well as it goes, but it can fall down when I get a whole series of
messages from one person right one after the other. I'm accustomed to a
routine where in most cases there's one or two things outstanding that need
to be resolved on any ongoing conversation, and the burst of unanswered
email gets in the way of that effort. </p>

<p>If you have a system that allows you to accumulate a queue, there will
inevitably be delays. I like being absolutely on top of my inbox and able
to answer queries as they come in, and there's some basic capacity in
messages per hour that I can process when I'm "on". Even emptying out a
queue into an issue tracker can take time, and thus inevitably there's
some things that don't get done instantly. </p>

<p>In periodic posts to Twitter I try to track my backlog. In truth there's
always something that will cause an event in my todo list to be overtaken
by events, at a pace of about one or two a day. The key mostly for me is
just to keep things flowing through, and to try very hard not to get so
bogged down in the moment that I can't tackle tougher tasks that actually
need more than 10 minutes of concentration.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues.
By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status.
This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well
as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.</p>

<p>I've been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while,
using its milestones feature to track categories. This has been mostly
a one-dimensional exercise of managing very long lists, or shorter lists.
It's been cumbersome to use either labels or milestones to handle the quick
need to say to yourself "I'm going to focus on this now" without the issue
sinking back quickly into a mile-long undifferentiated list.</p>

<p>Enter a whole series of Github add-ons that all add a similar feature, the kanban-style
column view. I'll list them here with any experience I currently have using
them. My best bet is that at some point Github absorbs one of these and makes 
it its own, but that is tempered by the realization that Github issues really
isn't changing much as a product.</p>

<p>Zenhub, <a href="https://www.zenhub.io/">zenhub.io</a>. This is a Google Chrome plugin, which gives you a kanban-style view of your issues. It only works in Chrome. I tried it, but didn't see an easy way to configure which columns referred to which labels, and after a few tries gave up on it.</p>

<p>Waffle, <a href="https://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a>. At the moment this is what I'm using. You authenticate to it with Github, and then it displays your issues. Free (for now), they are advertising that it will be $7/mo for private repos, which is what I currently pay for all of the rest of Github.</p>

<p>Huboard, <a href="https://huboard.com">huboard.com</a>. Free for open source repos or $7/mo/user for private repos. 14 day free trial. </p>

<p>Blossom, <a href="https://www.blossom.io">blossom.io</a>. No free plan, 14 day trial, minimum is a 5 user plan at $22/mo.</p>

<p>Task Tub, <a href="http://www.tasktub.com/">tasktub.com</a>. Company page does not load.</p>

<p>SweepBoard, <a href="http://sweepboard.com/">sweepboard.com</a>. Free for open source projects.</p>

<p>When I first started finding these sorts of things, I didn't really realize that it was a whole category of products. Most of them have some other features beyond the kanban to add to Github as a project management tool. I don't think there's a category winner, but if you are interested in visualizing your work and taking your todo list beyond the simple long list this is a useful set of tools to explore.</p>
