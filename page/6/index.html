<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>The Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is considering hiring "downtown ambassadors" to patrol city streets, help out visitors, and keep the downtown neat and clean and welcoming. </p>

<p>As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People's Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-12-vellum-a-downtown-ann-arbor-restaurant-has-closed/">Vellum, a downtown Ann Arbor restaurant, has closed</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The <a href="http://www.mlive.com/business/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/01/downtown_ann_arbors_vellum_to.html">Ann Arbor News story</a> tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.</p>

<p>What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. County health officials took a dim view of this, as seen in this excerpt from a <a href="http://www.healthinspection.info/establishments/1364">health inspection in February 2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Critical) Found a package of meat in a vacuum sealed package, and found beef short rib in a vacuum sealed package in the basement meat walk in cooler. These packages were the same size as the vacuum package supply in facility, and did not appear to be commercial products as there were no labels and pic could not provide any statements or boxes indicating from a commercial licensed source. Pic corrected by discarding meats in vacuum sealed packages. Found a piece of meat in a vacuum sealed package with " 140 degrees 4 and half hours" written on package in the walk in cooler. Pic states he does not know what marking mean and where this came from. Pic corrected by discarding meat. Found several pieces of sous vide equipment in the basement and main kitchen areas. Found at least 5 boxes of packages for vacuum packaging on the shelf in the basement prep area, and was denied access to room/closet next to shelf with vacuum packaging. To correct verify that no one in facility is using vacuum sealer or preparing food using sous vide method as a variance is required. This violation has repeated and a risk control plan is required to be submitted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your innovative kitchen depends on methods that are in violation of regulations, it's going to be hard to keep up the buzz when you have to give them up.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.</p>

<p>Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.</p>

<p>The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. Expect the neighborliness issue to be a substantial point of discussion.</p>

<p>The downtown zoning plans revolve around the changes proposed to what's now a parking lot next to the DTE building on S Main St. The parcel abuts a residential neighborhood and the neighbors don't particularly want a giant building to the west looming over their back yards.</p>

<p>On the consent agenda is approval of an emergency repair to the city's tower truck in the sum of $64,464.93 which is to repair damage from an accident on October 31, 2014. The fire department has brought its 18 year old previous tower unit back into service in reserve, according to the city administrator's notes accompanying the purchase order approval request.</p>

<p>Council will take up the issue of rezoning of a parcel at 3601 Plymouth Road to allow the construction of a Plum Market on the land most recently occupied by Cleary University.</p>

<p>It should be an early night at council.</p>

</p>

<p>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti
Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a
little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic
cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing
functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65
pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into
the machine.</p>

<p>Graveraet Middle School in Marquette had one of these, presumably
discarded from its use in the school administration. By 1977 the
machine was so completely obsolete that it sat idle, with no one
knowing how it worked. I got plenty of time to spend with the system,
and frankly I never really figured it out either. It was easy enough
to use it as an adding and multiplying and dividing machine, but
the mysteries of its program logic escaped me.</p>

<p>There are several folks who have active projects to restore the old
system, including a project at the DataMuseum in Denmark. <a
href="http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Olivetti/Programma_101/Revive">See their
efforts here.</a> There are quite a lot of mechanical parts in this
old machine, including a set of 8 pulleys that drove the various
bits of the card reader and the printer. Rubber rollers of course
get old and decayed with time so every account of a restoration has
some discussion of that repair.</p>

Spain, who outlines the use of the Programma 101 <a

<p>Trying to find reliable information about an event in progress half way around the world is always a challenge.

<p>Wikipedia's page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_AirAsia_Flight_8501">Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501</a> warns "Initial news reports may be unreliable". At the moment the page is up to date with as much of the fragments of news that have been made available, and it links to "unconfirmed and speculative early reports" that speak of wreckage being found.</p>

<p>Much less reputable are the reports of Russia Today and China's CCTV which take rumor as fact.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Every month I get an email with a spreadsheet of restaurant inspection reports from Washtenaw County. Here's a summary of the worst (and best) of the restaurants inspected in November 2014.</p>

<p>There are three types of problems reported by county health. To simplify reporting I score them proportionately to see which locations go to the top of the list. </p>

<p>6 locations had no problems at all:</p>

<ul>
<li>DOG DAYS III  2515 JACKSON    ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>DOMINICK'S    812 MONROE  ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>HOTEL HICKMAN WILD WEST ADVENTURES STFU   2400 HICKMAN RD ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>JIMMY JOHN'S GOURMET SANDWICHES   342 S. STATE STREET ANN ARBOR</li>
<li>OCED SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAM 2025 E. CLARK ROAD  YPSILANTI</li>
<li>WETZEL'S PRETZELS 100 BRIARWOOD CIRCLE K108   ANN ARBOR</li>
</ul>

<p>By far and away the worst restaurant is Tim Horton's on 760 S Hewitt Rd in Ypsilanti, with 9 priority violations, 8 priority foundation violations, and 14 core violations. 
This sums it up (all caps in original)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL IS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED IN THE FACILITY AS EVIDENCED BY EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY HANDWASHING, EMPLOYEES ARE MONITORING FOOD TEMPERATURES, PROPERLY WASHING AND SANITIZING CLEANED MULTIUSE EQUIPMENT AND UTENSILS BEFORE THEY ARE REUSED, MONITORING DISHWASHING PROCEDURES.

<p>Bill S.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disgusting - worst sandwich I have ever purchased in my life. Dried out chicken that tasted like it bad been sitting around for 3 days. Threw it out after 2 bites. Would have asked for a refund but didn't want to deal with the aggravated and stressed out staff running the place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mia M: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, the same person is running the drive thru window. She's rude and I overhear conversations that make me question the cleanliness inside the restaurant. "Grab a wet rag and pretend you wiped down the tables." "Put a towel on it and we'll clean it up later." Or my personal favorite, "We're out of coffee [and it's 8 o'clock in the morning.]" </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. "Begger's funnel plot" appears to be an accidental hybrid of the two names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem? A steep rise in the number of "meta-analysis" papers published in China, many of which seem to be following a common template for reporting results - including sharing typographic errors, mis-attribution, and formulaic text. </p>

<p>The best ongoing reporting on dishonesty in the scientific literature is <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> from Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus. Filion's post on <a href="http://blog.thegrandlocus.com/2014/10/a-flurry-of-copycats-on-pubmed">A flurry of copycats on PubMed</a> digs deeper into the problem, studying the copycat formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real shock came when we downloaded the papers. Most are behind paywalls, so we could access only 25 of them. There was no need for more, the pattern was very clear from the third study. The papers have exactly the same structure, with the same figures in the same order. The last figure of each paper is a “Begger’s funnel plot”, featuring a surrealistic fusion of Begg and Egger (Colin Begg and Matthias Egger both gave their name to a test for publication bias). What struck me the most was the similarity in the aesthetics of the figures, the same line widths, the same colors, the same shapes etc.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.</p>

<p>The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. Note that broadcasts in English are not 24 hours a day, and that shortwave reception varies widely by time of day and location of receiving station.</p>

<p>The key to do this is to acquaint yourself with <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a>, a project that allows multiple listeners to tune into the signal of a single wideband radio. You'll need to pick a receiver that has an antenna that covers the appropriate part of the broadcast band, and you'll need also a schedule for when the station is broadcasting.</p>

<p>Many shortwave schedules and stations can be located via <a href="http://www.short-wave.info/">short-wave.info</a>.  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" title="Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Given a schedule and a frequency, use WebSDR to find a suitable listening location. My two favorites for monitoring Havana are the original <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">WedSDR at U Twente</a> and <a href="http://96.225.100.244:8902/">K2SDR in New Jersey</a>. </p>

<p>Of course you can tune in via <a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Havana-Cuba-p1687/">TuneIn</a> and get to the broadcast direct. The sound will be more clear, and the reception more reasonable. But there's really something to be said for experiencing broadcast radio through the medium of radio rather than this newfangled Internet thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Dr. Dobb's Journal is closing down, with its last issue appearing at the end of 2014. They <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">tell their story</a> in a final report.</p>

<p>The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side, our revenue declined such that today it's barely 30% of what it was when I started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My memory of reading Dr. Dobb's dates back to the early 1990s, when it was a source for careful writing (complete with source code) on programming issues of the day. Now days there's an infinite supply of technical writing on the net, so it's not surprising that ad revenues dried up (or more pointedly got concentrated on Google the gatekeeper for much of online traffic).</p>

<p>"Running light without overbyte" was their first slogan. You can pick up a first edition of their compiled first year of publication (1976) from <a href="http://www.kuenzigbooks.com/pages/books/22185/dr-dobb/dr-dobbs-journal-of-computer-calisthenics-orthodontia-running-light-without-overbyte-volume-one">Kuenzig Books</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.</p>

<p>websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. There are websdr servers running around the globe, each tuned in to some particular slice of the radio waves. Multiple people can tune in at the same time and hear their own piece of the airwaves.</p>

<p>The interesting thing happens when you connect these two systems together. Some small number of the websdr receivers tune into the 2 meter band, which is the typical band used by Echolink. Using Echolink (or in my case the Mac application Echomac) I identified an Echolink host in the vicinity of the websdr receiver, then connected to it. Sure enough, I was able to hear my call sign back in through the websdr front end.</p>

<p>This little image shows the result. Transmitted via DM0ZHS, and monitored at http://129.187.5.188:8901/ on 145237.50 kHz, I'm sending from Isen, Germany and receiving the transmission at the Olympic Tower in Munich, Germany.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gall, John C. 9/18/1925 - 12/15/2014 Walker, MN John C. Gall, Jr.,
beloved husband, father, pediatrician, scholar and author, passed
away with his wife by his side Dec. 15, 2014, in Walker, MN, from
natural causes. He was 89. John was born on September 18, 1925 in
Washington, D.C. and grew up near Upperville, VA. In 1945 he was
drafted into the Army Air Corps and sent to Germany, where he served
as a medic in the Allied army of occupation. During his tour of
duty he attended the Nuremberg trials, which kindled in him a
lifelong passion to heal the afflicted and promote justice. Upon
returning home he furthered his education, graduating from Yale and
George Washington University Medical School. He was a postdoctorate
fellow at the Mayo Clinic, where he was dubbed &ldquo;the best pediatric
diagnostician [they had] ever seen!&rdquo; In addition he earned a
certification in Human Genetics and completed 7 years of therapy
training. Dr. Gall began his medical career as a researcher at the
University of Virginia, followed by a 3-year stint at the Geisinger
Clinic in Danville, PA. He next went into private practice in Miles
City, MT, but was soon invited to teach at the University of Michigan
Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. There he also served as head of
the Plymouth State Home, where he did research partially funded by
the Kennedy family foundation, and named and described several
syndromes of the developmentally disabled . In addition he established
a long-running private pediatric practice of 38 years. During this
period he developed a special appreciation for, and an enduring
interest in, the importance of nonverbal communication between very
young children and their parents. This led him to expand his practice
to include support and education classes, in which he was aided by
his late wife, Beth, and then by his wife Carol. Their observations
and anecdotes are included in Elegant Parenting, written with wife,
Beth; in Dancing with Elves written by John, and with wife Carol
he wrote Hit by a Low-Flying Goose. John&rsquo;s best known book is System
Antics, later published under the title The Systems Bible, a humorous
but insightful study of the problems and pitfalls that afflict every
type of system that human beings create-whether mechanical, economic,
corporate, aeronautical, legal, linguistic, religious, medical or
electronic. It was first published in 1976 by the New York
Times/Quadrangle Press and has been translated (officially or
unofficially) into at least 14 languages. He lectured widely
throughout the United States and was interviewed by the Voice of
America on nuclear proliferation issues after its publication. John
and Carol were both invited to speak in London in 2012 to a group
of CEOs and other executives from around the world and John was
introduced as &ldquo;The Grandfather of Systems Theory.&rdquo; He retired to
Walker, MN, in 2001 in search of privacy and uninterrupted time,
which he used to write seven other books, including a novel, First
Queen, plus books and video books on parenting and the art of
pediatric practice. He was very proud that the great Swiss psychiatrist,
Alice Miller, who introduced the world to the subject of child
sexual abuse, endorsed his work before she died. His work has also
been endorsed by others too numerous to name, but including such
luminaries as the head of the Dept. of Psychology at Cambridge,
University, who forwarded his material to several British social
service agencies. In the late 1990s John helped to write the National
Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Exam in Washington D.C several years
running. More recently he was invited to Washington D.C. by a
government psychiatrist and consulted with this man on the development
of psychological profiles of moles (double agents). He also spoke
at a symposium at Princeton University entitled &ldquo;Children under the
Shadow of War.&rdquo; The group included scholars from around the world,
and filmmakers who had photographed kidnapped children who had been
conscripted into war and forced to commit atrocities. It was John&rsquo;s
job to deliver the final speech, summarizing and tying together all
of the presentations. This was the only lecture open to the public.
John gave a moving presentation that left not a dry eye in the

      <p>Nothing personal, but it's time to take a break from Twitter.</p>

<p>I tried to do this <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">back in 2008</a> when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates.</p>

<p>I have a few bots that tweet out weather updates which I guess I will keep running because it's more trouble than it's worth to temporarily turn them off. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out
that the routine I have with Google's Gmail for handling inbound
correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail
to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.</p>

<p>I don't know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect,
but it seems to be pretty good. Email comes in, I read it, and anything
that deserves further attention but can't be handled right away is
starred. The next round of handling works its way through the starred 
messages, and when something in that queue is stuck and needs more
attention than I can get to at the moment it goes into a Github issue.
Periodically I work through Github, sort out some priority items,
and try to crank through the queues. </p>

<p>The problem with systems is that they periodically fail. My system works
OK as well as it goes, but it can fall down when I get a whole series of
messages from one person right one after the other. I'm accustomed to a
routine where in most cases there's one or two things outstanding that need
to be resolved on any ongoing conversation, and the burst of unanswered
email gets in the way of that effort. </p>

<p>If you have a system that allows you to accumulate a queue, there will
inevitably be delays. I like being absolutely on top of my inbox and able
to answer queries as they come in, and there's some basic capacity in
messages per hour that I can process when I'm "on". Even emptying out a
queue into an issue tracker can take time, and thus inevitably there's
some things that don't get done instantly. </p>

<p>In periodic posts to Twitter I try to track my backlog. In truth there's
always something that will cause an event in my todo list to be overtaken
by events, at a pace of about one or two a day. The key mostly for me is
just to keep things flowing through, and to try very hard not to get so
bogged down in the moment that I can't tackle tougher tasks that actually
need more than 10 minutes of concentration.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues.
By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status.
This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well
as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.</p>

<p>I've been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while,
using its milestones feature to track categories. This has been mostly
a one-dimensional exercise of managing very long lists, or shorter lists.
It's been cumbersome to use either labels or milestones to handle the quick
need to say to yourself "I'm going to focus on this now" without the issue
sinking back quickly into a mile-long undifferentiated list.</p>

<p>Enter a whole series of Github add-ons that all add a similar feature, the kanban-style
column view. I'll list them here with any experience I currently have using
them. My best bet is that at some point Github absorbs one of these and makes 
it its own, but that is tempered by the realization that Github issues really
isn't changing much as a product.</p>

<p>Zenhub, <a href="https://www.zenhub.io/">zenhub.io</a>. This is a Google Chrome plugin, which gives you a kanban-style view of your issues. It only works in Chrome. I tried it, but didn't see an easy way to configure which columns referred to which labels, and after a few tries gave up on it.</p>

<p>Waffle, <a href="https://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a>. At the moment this is what I'm using. You authenticate to it with Github, and then it displays your issues. Free (for now), they are advertising that it will be $7/mo for private repos, which is what I currently pay for all of the rest of Github.</p>

<p>Huboard, <a href="https://huboard.com">huboard.com</a>. Free for open source repos or $7/mo/user for private repos. 14 day free trial. </p>

<p>Blossom, <a href="https://www.blossom.io">blossom.io</a>. No free plan, 14 day trial, minimum is a 5 user plan at $22/mo.</p>

<p>Task Tub, <a href="http://www.tasktub.com/">tasktub.com</a>. Company page does not load.</p>

<p>SweepBoard, <a href="http://sweepboard.com/">sweepboard.com</a>. Free for open source projects.</p>

<p>When I first started finding these sorts of things, I didn't really realize that it was a whole category of products. Most of them have some other features beyond the kanban to add to Github as a project management tool. I don't think there's a category winner, but if you are interested in visualizing your work and taking your todo list beyond the simple long list this is a useful set of tools to explore.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Twitter, especially. A search this morning for "ann arbor ice" gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around. Streets and highways were bad, and a Delta flight slid off the runway at DTW. For Michigan weather follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/miwx">#miwx</a> hashtag.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Maps with the "traffic" overlay. Zoom way out, and you'll see splotches of red, showing where traffic is moving at significantly lower than posted speeds; zoom in, and you get recent reports from motorists using Waze reporting specific incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Broadcastify's "top feeds". Here you count on citizens monitoring public safety traffic to give you an idea of what kinds of places are working a lot of incidents. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/top">top feeds</a> can also be set up to generate alerts on your phone if you use their mobile app.</p></li>
<li><p>Power outage maps, for when storms and incidents get really bad. There's no one single source to go to, but if you can figure out which utility company covers an area, their outage map is a good measure of storm location or path and intensity.</p></li>
<li><p>The morning's problem was ice. An unusual and good map of ice risk is the <a href="http://www.spia-index.com/">SPIA Index</a>, a metric that combines an ice forecast with a wind forecast to predict damage. </p></li>

      </h3>
      <p>Some questions to ask while you're trying to sort this out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end
to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the
parts that "just work", because undoubtably there are 
unexpected cases that won't work just when you need them 
to work. </p></li>
<li><p>Identify the message flows through the system.
Where do signals get generated, where do they get
retransmitted, where do they get changed and when
does a human interpret them? Look for feedback loops,
where messages oscillate between two parts of a system.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out what kind of time scale you need to operate
on, and understand the characteristics of delays within
the system. Identify the cycle time of critical components,
how often they can be queried and especially how long it
takes to return an accurate reading. </p></li>
<li><p>Form follows funding. Understand the financial flows
through the system that constrain the data flows. If a
process costs money, sort out the planning and
budgeting implications of making a change. Systems that
are subject to external regulation may have unexpected
constraints on operations and reporting, </p></li>
<li><p>Complex working systems are in a perpetual state of
partial failure, and often the resolution of partial failures
involves human inputs. Consider the human element in
the systems design, and draw that into your functional
design.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's possible to overthink all of these, and some of the
parts decompose into smaller parts that are in turn rather
complex. Inside every complex working system is a simpler
system that works, and you are looking to identify that at
the core of your efforts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. That's a pretty typical pattern for me
these days, and I'm trying to make sense of whether it's a good one.</p>

<p>The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out
what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours.
There are lots of competitors for the morning attention, including yesterday's
inbox, the overnight news, and the steady tick of Twitter and Facebook. You could
sit and just read things for a while and not get anything in particular done.</p>

<p>One element of morning focus could be simply on churning out something - anything -
that was a sign of progress towards a goal. This doesn't even need to be anything
substantial, just a morning wakeup exercise to get the keys moving. I experimented
with <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750wordscom-a-writing-environment-for-a-daily-writing-exercise.html">750 Words</a>, a system designed for just this
daily writing exercise. That was ultimately unsatisfying, though I like the idea
the details didn't work out. This effort gets called "Morning Pages" which I guess
justifies as part of a writer's craft.</p>

<p>Daily work is hard, hard work. It asks you to be able to tune in and focus
each and every day, whether or not you woke up with that idea in mind. Carving
out that chunk of the day, committing to a specific goal, tracking your progress
towards the goal (without the tracking being its own burden), and following through
in the absence of some easy feedback. </p>

<p>I read my own advice about doing things frequently and sometimes I laugh at my
own cheery suggestions. "Write about the same thing twice a day", I cheerily suggest in the <a href="http://vielmettti.typepad.com/secret">Blogger's Secret</a>, "and do that for six months". OK, which thing? What happens if two weeks into this commitment you discover that it's not the right thing to do?</p>

<p>So wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. Produce something. If you need to determine how it fits into a bigger plan, do your edits in the afternoon.</p>

      </h3>
      <h1>wjchat is a weekly Wednesday night chat session on Twitter. "wj"</h1>

<p>in this case is short for "web journalism". Tonight's session is on
using social media for long term editorial projects.</p>

<p>The longest long-term editorial project I'm working on that's relevant
to this is Arborwiki, which is now part of the Localwiki project. It's
a local encyclopedia of the Ann Arbor area, and as such it's a very
useful spot to accumulate the back story for any story that you want to
tell. It's an ideal place to write the little biographical sketch for
someone who's in the news, to write up a brief history of important issues,
or to collect public records that help you understand the ins and outs
of some ongoing project. The effort started in 2005 and is still going strong.</p>

<p>I've gotten so accustomed to having a wiki as an outboard memory
that I understand that if I don't write something down, I'm not
likely to be able to find it again. That impulse is tempered by the
realization that writing it down might take an appreciable amount of
time, since the value of a fragment or an incomplete image is limited.</p>

<p>The biggest headache of any long-term editorial project is that it's
very hard to get the exact right point of view expressed so that if
you walk away from the thing you're working on for a year or two that
you can come back to it and bring it up to date easily. The durable
pages look like a "tick-tock" with a heavy emphasis on a timeline and
much less in the way of explanation. If you can at least get a solid
timeline nailed down, you can at least pick up the story (in non-wiki,
proper story form) after leaving it and be have some good backstory to pick
and choose from.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm working on a project that will remain nameless. The sponsor of the
project asked me not to write about it, and I agreed. I'm spending a lot
of time communicating about the project, but those communications are
all private. It's intensely frustrating.</p>

<p>I learn best by writing about what I'm doing, in enough detail to capture
some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening.
There's no better way for me to learn - and to teach - than by documenting
the bits and pieces as I go, while they are still fresh. I write in a form
that's framed so that the pieces which are sharable are shared widely,
and if there's anything private that gets edited out. I've learned to do this
over time, and when it works, it works well.</p>

<p>When you write things down for the world to see, such as in this weblog or
carefully for Twitter, you get the benefit of fast feedback. People can see
what you are interested in, and you can reach out to them with something
relevant on the front page of what they see when they look for you. If there
are questions that are top of mind they can go to the top of the page. It's
a very effective way to take advantage of introductions, and to reach out
beyond people you know.</p>

<p>Without the ability to write things down it's easy to flounder. You end up
reviewing ground that you had gone over before because you forgot it, and
didn't write it down somewhere you could find it. Decisions that were made
and observations that were agreed on get revisited sometimes endlessly because
there's no contemporaneous record of the conclusion. Obscure details that
you want to follow up on later get wiped out. </p>

<p>This particular project has an internal communications tool, which will also
remain nameless. It's a stylized, formalized, cartoonish caricature of what
people actually use in real life, and it's designed to maximize management
visibility into the process rather than the utility of the process to the goal.
In many ways it reminds me of other systems I've been forced into where the
sole measure of progress was the easiest thing to measure, and all of your
hard qualitative work gets squeezed down into a single number (number of 
transactions, queue depth) that bears very little resemblance to anything useful.</p>

<p>I've written before about systems and why they fail; that's actually part of
my 140 character Twitter biography. Here the failures probably are on my part,
for not understanding the project expectations before starting, and not being
able to exit gracefully before the effort is over. The whole effort has given
me a sour taste. Most importantly, I understand sadly that being asked not to
write has been to cut off the most important part of what I can contribute to
an effort, and in retrospect I should have walked out of the room when that happened.</p>

      <p>Note to self: if you get asked to be part of a project, 
and then subsequently get asked to not talk about that
project, renegotiate the terms of that effort promptly.
Non-disclosure has wide ranging consequences, and that's
especially true when you habitually learn about how
something works by writing about it. </p>

<p>In retrospect, I should have walked out of the room.
That would have been brave and not foolish.</p>
