<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>One of the challenges in getting things started is figuring
out where the end product is going to live. Hugo has its own
web server which is pretty nice, but since it generates static
pages, the results can really go anywhere.</p>

<p>This tutorial goes through the process in excruciating detail</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/">http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/</a></p>

<p>but somehow fails to make it easy. What I&rsquo;d like is a publishing
workflow that just like the normal Hugo workflow puts things online
instantly once they are built.</p>

<p>This one deploys with CodeShip</p>

<p><a href="http://jice.lavocat.name/blog/2015/hugo-deployment-via-codeship/">http://jice.lavocat.name/blog/2015/hugo-deployment-via-codeship/</a></p>

<p>And this one deploys with Wercker</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/">http://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/</a></p>

<p>Yet one more, with Github hooks and S3/Cloudfront; it depends on s3cmd.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com">https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com</a></p>

<p>Finally, one that focuses on the github side of things:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950">https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950</a></p>

<p>The approach I have runs like so, it assumes that you have
a working directory &ldquo;~/src/hugo&rdquo; with your blog in it, and
a target directory &ldquo;~/src/vielmetti.github.io&rdquo; set up for
github pages.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/src/hugo
hugo -d ../vielmetti.github.io --theme=vacuum
# wait to build, then
cd ../vielmetti.github.io
git add -A .
git commit -m &quot;build complete&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>By having separate build directories like this you can keep the
continuous build on your draft setup going, and then push a
working version whenever you&rsquo;re perfectly happy with the result.
Not like anyone is really perfectly happy with any blog.</p>

<p>The dish also calls for rice pasta, but again feel free to substitute;
you&rsquo;re aiming for something like a rotini which handles the sauce well.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Take out a lasagna pan, which is

<li>1 large can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>bread crumbs</li>
<li>ground nutmeg</li>
<li>romano cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil water for pasta; cook a pound or so of your favorite pasta,
we use a rice rotini pasta in this one.</p>

<p>Shred the cheese fine in a food processor or with a hand grater.</p>

<p>When the pasta is done, drain it, and then put about half of it
in the lasagna pan. Cover with about half of the cheese and half of
the tomatoes. Put the rest of the pasta in, then more tomatoes and
more cheese. Top with breadcrumbs and then sprinkle a little romano
cheese on top and a few pinches of nutmeg for flavor.</p>

<p>Cook 20-25 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the
tomato sauce is bubbling.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Themes can be customized by editing the top matter, or by
directly changing the theme. The challenge is understanding
enough of how the moving parts interconnect to make it do what
you want it to do, or at least enough of them so that you don&rsquo;t
have a blog that just looks like a weak ripoff of someone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This tutorial</p>

<p><a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13">http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13</a></p>

<p>does a very nice job of helping you walk through the simple
bits. It does not get far enough to give you a sense for how
to get pagination working but that&rsquo;s at least a start.</p>

<p>There should be a super easy way to iterate through all
of the themes. I&rsquo;m looking for one that already nicely has
some way of doing categories or tags or some kind of metadata.
It would be extra super swell to find one that has a sidebar
and footer structure to so that I can (finally) recreate notebook
pages. I think I have someone that goes OK as a start - it
wants to insert dynamic content into the sidebar for the home page,
and then also to insert content that depends on the categories
or tags for individual pages, so that the whole thing feels more
like a carefully constructed notebook and less like a simple blog.</p>

<p>At some point you can iterate endlessly on appearance and completely
lose track of contents. Fortuantely I have a body of work that I really
want to see in this, so that motivates some level of forward progress.
For instance, I&rsquo;d love to see categories actually work here, since I
have some content that belongs together. I also have sidebar ideas
that really want to be exercised again.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-converting-typepad-to-hugo/">converting typepad to hugo</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The task of the night was getting a few years worth of Typepad posts
into Hugo.</p>

<p>My first step was to convert to Jekyll format, which I did using this
typepad_to_jekyll Ruby gem:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll">https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll</a></p>

<p>You then need to do a few things to get the Jekyll files exactly right
for Hugo:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the date format</li>
<li>Rewrite the Categories</li>
<li>Download and relink all of the images</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing the format for &ldquo;date&rdquo; was a one-liner in perl with the -i (&ldquo;edit in
place&rdquo;) flag.  I didn&rsquo;t get to the category rewrite or the image rescue yet.
The approach I took was to simply hack on the output files, rather than
change the source code to the typepad_to_jekyll program, but if you were
serious about it you&rsquo;d do the latter and fork it until it did the right thing.</p>

<p>Relinking all of the images requires opening a support ticket because Typepad
does not have an easy image export. Actually image hosting is a real
challenge and I don&rsquo;t know exactly the right way to do it inside Hugo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need to adjust the theme or pick a new theme so that it only shows
the first n posts on a page and then paginates, and I also need to adjust
it so that it shows categories. The show everything approach is unreasonable
when you have 1000s of pages to show off. On the other hand, the most
reasonable themes that I can find that look nice don&rsquo;t have pagination
turned on by default. There&rsquo;s some learning curve to roll my own, maybe
one that has some kind of reasonable sidebar structure.</p>

<p>We then went to the Malletts Creek library, until about 4:00 p.m.

      <p>So 634 pages from my Github Gollum based Wiki markup all got imported
into Hugo and it rendered all of them in 828 ms, or basically under
a second to pull in everything I&rsquo;ve ever written. Astonishingly fast.</p>

<p>Alas, those files while they are in Markdown are not really ready for
direct import, since they have [[double brackets]] everywhere that
get uglified. The other limiting factor is the date marker that&rsquo;s not
included with them so they all show up as January 1, 0001 which is
funny the first few times and then not funny.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Hugo have an import function? It does, for converting front
matter. The closest for importing other things are the various Jekyll
converters which aren&rsquo;t really the same.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Progress, actually quite a lot of it:</p>

<p>The problem, neatly stated. Docker is good for bringing up single services ("microservices"), but sometimes your application needs more than one thing running for the whole thing to work. Enter "docker compose", formerly "fig", which automates the process of running various Docker commands in the right order with the right arguments all driven from a configuration file. As described by their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The particular task I have in front of me is launching Node-RED and mosquitto (an MQTT broker) together on a Raspberry Pi 2 which is running Hypriot and Docker. Most of the background for <em>why</em> that's a relevant task is at this post on Hypriot, <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-compose-nodejs-haproxy/">How to use Docker Compose to run complex multi container apps on your Raspberry Pi</a>, which I dutifully and successfully managed to run all of the examples from. </p>

<p>Emboldened by this I tried to get Wordpress running with MySQL but got stuck because of a variety of things (not the least of which was some over-enthusiastic documentation that downplayed the complexity of that task, and the lack of a Pi-specific Wordpress Docker images). But having had the taste of what might be I carried on until I managed to get something to work for what I really wanted: Node-RED running alongside mosquitto so that I could have a local MQTT broker to talk to.</p>

<pre>
nodered:
  image: nieleyde/rpi2-nodered
  command: flows.json
  volumes:
    - /home/pi/node-red:/root/.node-red
  ports: 
    - "1880:1880"
  links:
    - mosquitto

mosquitto:
  image: nieleyde/rpi-mosquitto
  ports:
    - "1883:1883"
</pre>

<p>Some subtleties to note:</p>

<p>The nieleyde/rpi2-nodered runs on the Pi 2; there's a corresponding nieleyde/rpi-nodered for the Pi. Both are ARM images. I haven't yet tweaked this to run on x86, but if you do, you'll need to update the "image" stanzas everywhere.</p>

<p>The "command" and "volumes" stanzas in the nodered configuration serve to make Docker mount a subdirectory on the host machine where the flows.json file is stored; this makes changes to the configuration persistent. If you want a read-only configuration, you'll need to change this; I haven't gotten that far yet. It might also make sense to have a data volume container, but again I'm not there yet.</p>

<p>The "mosquitto" configuration is extremely bare bones and runs the default config, which is wide open. I haven't gotten far enough to replace the config file with something better, but that's an obvious next step.</p>

<p>From within Node-RED you refer to this internal MQTT server at hostname "mosquitto", port "1883". If the links stanza was changed to "mqtt" and the mosquitto section was changed to "mqtt" you'd then refer to the MQTT server at hostname "mqtt".</p>

<p>For further reading:</p>

<p>An issue open on Niel Eyde's rpi-nodered Github, <a href="https://github.com/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/issues/5">documentation for how to extend this image with your own nodes and flows</a>, where I'm working some of this out.</p>

      <p>Of course you never read the comments, but you might read the commentary on the comments. Here's The Verge's decision to turn off comments on its stories for the summer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And sometimes it gets too intense. What we've found lately is that the tone of our comments (and some of our commenters) is getting a little too aggressive and negative — a change that feels like it started with GamerGate and has steadily gotten worse ever since. It's hard for us to do our best work in that environment, and it's even harder for our staff to hang out with our audience and build the relationships that led to us having a great community in the first place.</p>

      <p>Your comments excluded, of course, dear reader, though there are
more posts here than comments by people on those posts. The reference
is to the interminable slog of newspaper comments which place a
long stream of dreck at the end of that carefully edited story.</p>

<p>I miss the days of carefully considered letters to the editor -
when you could count on not every letter getting published, when
you were limited to a certain number of words, and when if you were
wildly off-topic your words might never see the light of day. An
editor would pick a selection of letters to run, and some wouldn&rsquo;t
make the cut.</p>

<p>Publishers who have well-edited work up front shouldn&rsquo;t diminish
the impact of their work by giving the great unwashed Internet
access to their platform to post whatever the heck they please. It
detracts from the work to have unedited commentary on it posted so
close to the original. At a minimum any comments should be held for
approval before being posted, just so that the balance of power
tips over to the editor and not to the drooling, mouth-breathing
commentariat.</p>

      <p>From the BBC: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33306158">Greece's bank holiday from hell</a>. Greek banks are expected to stay shuttered for more than a week, and in the meantime depositors can only withdraw 60 euros per day.</p>

      <p>The evening's work can be roughly summed up as</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with 'A'. Much of the time, that will be a person's name.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment on that person's weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until 'Z'.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on "The algorithm driven day". In reading through it I am not sure it needs to see the light of day just yet, but it does help me wonder what parts of our efforts are driven by randomness and which are put there by design and how on earth one might tell the difference.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/"><code>squid</code> is a web caching system</a>. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don't have the data, and way faster when you do.</p>

<p>I'm doing some automated data collection from the web using <code>curl</code>, and as a part of that I want to not be overly aggressive in harvesting details from a site if I already have a recent copy of the data that hasn't changed. Putting a cache in the way makes sense, since unlike most GUI based browsers that have their own caches, <code>curl</code> just fetches whatever it's asked for unquestioningly even if it just got the same thing seconds ago - unless you tell it to use a cache.</p>

<p>The first appearance of squid dates to 1996, so it's old software by modern standards. It dates from the bad old days when the Internet was slow on long haul links but fast locally, and so it made all the sense in the world to optimize and economize. Even now there are lots of times and places where the net is slow enough that you're willing to introduce a little bit of complexity in exchange for a little bit of speed.</p>

<p>I installed my copy of squid on my Mac using MacPorts, which seems to do a fine job. I had also tried to build a copy of squid using what looked like simple instructions on Docker using the configuration on <a href="https://github.com/michaljemala/docker-squid">@michaeljemala/docker-squid</a>, but for reasons as of yet unexplained I got the error message</p>

<p><code>
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3128: Connection refused
</code></p>

<p>after setting that up and following package directions.  Still puzzling out whether that's a result of some Docker configuration oddness on 1.7.0, or something else. Anyway, the native version is working, so I'm good for now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don't think that's the part of the hobby I'm most interested in.</p>

<p>The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you'd think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that's hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. It feels really noisy and unnecessarily difficult. I am told that some contesters use software defined radio to watch more of the band - that seems more effective than just listening to one narrow channel and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>I guess I'm much more used to using repeaters than I am to simplex operations. With a repeater at least you have a positive acknowledgement that your transmission was received by a machine, and with that you can get a better sense for what you sound like on the air. I'm also used to a station acting as "net control" and acknowledging people and managing the flow of conversations. In contrast the contest sounds like chaos.</p>

<p>For whatever the unfamiliarity is, the other reality is that to listen to it, contests can be pretty boring. People give out the barest of bare minimum of information about their station and then move on.</p>

<p>What Field Day brings to mind is a much more interesting event I was a little part of last year, the <a href="http://www.nj2bb.org/museum/">Museum Ships Weekend Event</a> run by The Battleship New Jersey Amateur Radio Station NJ2BB. I went to the Hands-On Museum in early June 2014 and listened and talked to shipboard radio stations on museum ships around the world. It was a lot more fun because the station operators were less concerned about maximizing the count of their contacts and more interested in telling the stories of their museums. </p>

      <p>Gogs is a self-hosted Git server, an alternative to using Github as a for-pay hosted service or Gitlab as another self-hosted system. It's written in the Go language, and is said to be sparing of system resources.</p>

<p>I'm building it using Docker on a Raspberry Pi 2, thanks to the folks at Hypriot; the writeup is <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/run-your-own-github-like-service-with-docker/">Run your own GitHub-like service with the help of Docker</a>, and the file on Dockerhub is at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian/">hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian</a>. The install went essentially as described; note that if you are using Avahi to provide a .local name service, you can avoid using IP addresses in configuration files and instead use names like "black-pearl.local" as your hostname.</p>

<p>Juan B. Rodriguez did a nice writeup of <a href="http://jbrodriguez.io/gogs-an-alternative-to-gitlab/">Gogs, an alternative to Gitlab</a>, again with a Docker based installation description and a nice feature comparison.</p>

<p>After some poking around with Gogs I noted three substantial limitations, none of which are complete show-stoppers but which collectively give me pause about doing a wholesale replacement of Github with Gogs; and a fourth that gives me hope for some project that might address these issues but which might not end up being called Gogs.</p>

<p>First, there's no built-in wiki. I don't always use a wiki with a Github repository, and when I do I'm not always thrilled by the minimalist features of Github's wiki, but it's mighty handy and I miss it right away. Gogs doesn't have a wiki, and though it's been an acknowledged issue for a long time it doesn't seem to have any forward movement.</p>

<p>Second, there's no built-in file editor. I'm very used to the workflow where you see a file that has some small problem, you fork the repository right in the editor, type in your fix, save, and submit your patch to the maintainers. It's a very straightforward way of doing small things efficiently without dropping down to the command line, and the lack of it makes Gogs hard to understand how it would work in a mostly-web world.</p>

<p>Third, Gogs has a lot of obvious copying from Github, and I'm uncertain about the whole ethos of wholesale replication of documentation. Sometimes there's not even an effort made to document what the system does and instead there's just a link to Github documentation. Self-hosted systems should have self-hosted documentation, and even if you're replicating someone else's system faithfully you still need to write up your own docs.</p>

<p>Fourth and finally, Gogs has been forked. "gitea" is "Git with a cup of tea", and it seems to have a bunch of energy to fix things that the Gogs project is currently lacking. See <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea">the gitea project on Github</a> and its corresponding <a href="https://gitter.im/go-gitea/gitea">gitter chat for gitea</a>. gitea has not produced a release yet, but when it does I'll be sure to look for a reasonable packaging of it to try it out.</p>

<p>All of that said, I'm happy to have found Gogs, and plan to poke through it some more and store some not-very-important files in it for a while until I get some confidence in it. I don't think it (or gitea) is an instant replacement for my hosted Github service, but for the narrow purpose of holding a private repository beyond what Github provides for its service plan it looks like a reasonable alternative now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I followed the instructions on <a href="http://www.linuxmediaserver.net/linux-basics/streaming-webcam-raspberry-pi/">this post on LinuxMediaServer.net</a> to get an old Logitech web camera running on a Raspberry Pi 2. Here are some of the changes I did from the original to support my hardware.</p>

<p>lsusb returns this device:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 046d:08ae Logitech, Inc. QuickCam for Notebooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to add a driver for the camera:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo modprobe gspca_zc3xx</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The camera I have shows up as /dev/video0 and has a resolution of 320x240:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo ./mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so -r 320x240 -d /dev/video0" -o "./output_http.so -w www" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Existence proof, showing that it works. You should be able to recognize the Festifools t-shirt.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>It's not an awesome camera, but the resolution is perfectly adequate to a small task. A next challenge, should I choose to take it on, is to wrap up all of the dependencies into a Dockerfile and do a Docker build. I'm going to wait on that until Docker 1.7.1 drops since 1.7.0 is not stable on ARM platforms. I haven't yet successfully managed to get Docker on the Pi to read from USB devices (but how hard, indeed, could it be).</p>

<p>UPDATE: looks like @chuckleb built a Dockerfile for this for Ubuntu at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/chuckleb/mjpg-streamer/">chuckleb/mjpg-streamer</a>. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: If you're using the Raspberry Pi camera, <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi">Miguel Grinberg has these build instructions for that device</a>.</p>

<p>I suspect that this hiatus will be temporary, as I have previously <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">quit Twitter</a> and look at me now.</p>

<p>"The only way to win is not to play." </p>

<p>With the time I have left from not being on Facebook I should be able to send more postcards, write more blog entries, sort through some accumulated paper, and what not. It's not like there's any shortage of other things to do in person and on the net.</p>

<p>UPDATE: When I don't look at Facebook, I look at this weblog more; and when I look at this weblog, I do more tech stuff and less non-tech stuff. That's an OK balance.</p>
