Why was the launch scrubbed this time?

Hydrogen leaks (STS-127) (STS-73)Thunderstorms (STS-93)Problem circuit card in the pyrotechnic initiator controller (STS-51)
Perseid meteor shower&#0160;(STS-51)
I didn&#39;t see a complete list of all possible reasons, but there are lots of problems that can happen when you launch into space. &#0160;I watched two launches in the last few days - the SpaceX rocket which went up without a hitch, and the shuttle which went up on its 6th try, all very exciting to see. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-17-why-the-launch-was-scrubbed/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Another copy of the Ann Arbor Gerbil showed up on my sidewalk this morning. &#0160;It&#39;s nice to have a morning paper, much nicer than the mid-afternoon Ann Arbor Snooze that used to never arrive quite early enough to read over lunch, and by the time it got to be after dinner to read it it was most of a day old.

Some of last week&#39;s Gerbils that were left on lawns unread decayed enough to leave crumbs of newspaper on the lawns of apartment buildings on Packard, no worse so far than the occasional decaying NY Times or Wall St Journals that sometimes pile up in front of student rentals unread. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-17-a-blogger-reads-the-newspaper-day-13/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>day 9 of notes on my new job at annarbor.com
A new newspaper showed up on my sidewalk yesterday afternoon; I&#39;m not going to name it by name, but let&#39;s just call it the A2 Gerbil.&#0160; It was a happy little paper, full of happy little stories about quaint things happening in some leafy town somewhere near here.&#0160; It took me a couple of minutes to leaf through it and a few more minutes to hunt down the web site for it and appreciate some of its finer points. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-11-a-blogger-reads-the-newspaper-day-9/">&raquo;</a></p>

Almost every week for the last 4 years I&#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-09-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary-day-8/">&raquo;</a></p>
