<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

but if you do so, make sure you read the Ann Arbor city ordinances and all of the very, very fine print very carefully:
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
No permit shall be issued to a person, by the City, and no chickens shall be allowed to be kept unless the owners of all residentially
zoned adjacent properties (see 9:42(3)(j)) consent in writing to the permit. Please attach the Adjacent Neighbor Consent Form to
this application and check the box that you understand and have complied with the terms of this ordinance requirement.<br />
 <br /></div><br /><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
If the requirements of Chapter 107 are not complied with, the City may revoke any permit granted and/or initiate prosecution for a
civil infraction violation. A person who has been issued a permit shall submit it for examination upon demand by any police officer or
code enforcement officer. Fenced enclosures are subject to all provisions of Chapter 104 (Fences). Notwithstanding the issuance of a
permit by the City, private restrictions on the use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit. Private
restrictions include but are not limited to deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws,
and covenant deeds. A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of chickens
is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved.<br /><br /></div><p><a href="http://www.repastspresentandfuture.org/123-people-eat-at-selma-cafe-and-king-of-calm-silvio-medoro-does-not-break-a-sweat/#respond">What happens if the man doesn&#39;t agree with your poultry easement</a>: you get a personal visit from the city attorney (!!!!!) who is apparently the city&#39;s only animal control officer.</p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">We decided we were not interested in pursuing the official permit,
as we are a bit out of compliance anyway and do not really feel this
should be required (that this process is more just a way for the city
to ease into a common sense practice). The city attorney hand delivered
a notice telling us of all our waywardness. I will post a
notice/petition of support out front. Please come by and sign it when
you get a chance. Thanks!!</p><p>Read the <a href="http://www.chickenvideo.com/topten.html">Top Ten Reasons to Raise Your Own Yard Hens</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">

      <p><p>If the power goes out for an extended period of time, some of your food can go bad.&#0160; Here&#39;s pointers to documents you can grab ahead of time and print out so that you can know how to sort through things.</p><p>From the <a href="https://americanredcross.com/services/disaster/0,1082,0_564_,00.html">American Red Cross: Food safety in a power outage</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Sudden power outages can be frustrating and troublesome, especially
when they are prolonged. Perishable foods should not be held above 40
degrees for more than 2 hours. If a power outage is 2 hours or less,
you need not be concerned, but how do you save your food when the
refrigerator is out for longer times? Being prepared can help. By
planning ahead, you can save your perishables.</p><p>USDA, <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/keeping_food_Safe_during_an_emergency/index.asp">Keeping Food Safe During an Emergency</a></p><p class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible
    to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food
    safely cold for about 4 hours if it is unopened. A full freezer
    will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if
    it is half full) if the door remains closed. Obtain dry or block
    ice to keep your refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is
    going to be out for a prolonged period of time. Fifty pounds of
    dry ice should hold an 18-cubic foot full freezer for 2 days. Plan
    ahead and know where dry ice and block ice can be purchased. </p><p>CDC, <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/poweroutage/needtoknow.asp">What you need to know when the power goes out unexpectedly</a></p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of your food right
before you cook or eat it. Throw away any food that has a temperature

<li>The paragraph is the unit of composition.&#0160; Keep your paragraphs together, making it possible to have any one of them pulled out and quoted in some other part of the internet without losing too much in the process.&#0160; If your narrative has complicated paragraphs, be aware that someone might pull out only a sentence from it. </li>
<li>Write where it&#39;s easy to find what you said.&#0160;&#0160; </li>

rates, measured by weighing snow blown into a filter fabric trap, were
greater over hard snow or ice than for the same wind speed over soft,

blizzards showed that friction between moving particles and the surface
was less, and particle speeds were greater over hard surfaces.
Transport rates at a given wind speed increased rapidly as aerodynamic
roughness decreased in the rough-smooth transition region. Bagnold&#39;s
theory for bed load transport provided a useful framework for the
analysis.</div><p><br />So, what we have includes modeling systems when there is inclement weather, modeling the transport of fine particles during inclement weather, and building simulators that are computer controlled to let you see how things work.&#0160; All fun ideas.</p><p><a href="http://www.pasty.com/heikki/heikkilunta.html">(More info at pasty.com)</a></p>

      <p>Some notes, more for myself than for you.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Horseradish">Horseradish</a> is now available at market; $4 for a jar from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Grandma%27s_Kitchen">Grandma&#39;s Kitchen</a>.&#0160; Grandma says hers is pure, not mixed with turnip as some would do.&#0160; </p><p>Farmers Market had a lot of produce - field greens and flowers were the big new crops.&#0160; We had some tat soi from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Shannon_Brines">Shannon Brines</a> that was very good in a stir fry.</p><p>The phone on the farm in Homer, MI is answered only at 8am, if I read the handout right.</p><p>No zucchini yet (and not expected for a long while), but Grandma says that if you mix the zucchini with a small amount of pineapple essential oil and let it sit overnight you&#39;ll swear that it was really fresh pineapples.</p><p>People&#39;s Food Coop had sunflower sprouts (or sunsprouts) from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Gardenworks">Gardenworks</a>.&#0160; Delicious and green with the taste of the sunflower.&#0160; It would be a nice add-in to a mixed stirfry greens or as a few on top of a rice and beans salad.</p><p>If I start the lentil soup from Martha Rose at 9am (p84-85) I can not hurry in the evening on Monday.</p><p>Add a little water and cook off the crusty rice at the bottom of the rice pan, stirring until you have a kind of a rice slurry.&#0160; Then add salt, pepper, and butter to taste.&#0160; Mmmm.</p><p>Mexican style kosher for Passover foods recipes from <span><a href="http://www.jewishchronicle.org/article.php?article_id=11366"> Julian Medina, chef and owner of Toloache</a>.&#0160; To read more than to cook.<br /></span></p><p><span><a href="http://www.pixietangerine.com/">Ojai Pixie Tangerines</a> at Trader Joes in Ann Arbor.&#0160; </span>The Pixie is a result of open 
             pollination of Kincy mandarins (Kincys are a hybrid 
             between a King Mandarin and a Dancy Tangerine).&#0160; Small and delicious.</p><p>People&#39;s Food Coop does a much better job than Whole Foods at merchandising their <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Ann_Arbor_Tortilla_Factory">Ann Arbor Tortilla Factory</a> tortillas; they are much fresher, and you don&#39;t have to dig into the cooler to see them.&#0160; Both places have troubles keeping them in stock daily.&#0160; Produce Station is another good source.</p><p>The Avalon Bread bakery is very close to Wayne State University, but I don&#39;t have any sense for that walk.&#0160; <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=422+w+willis,+detroit+mi+48201&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=r2XZSfXfMYy0NerLnAY&amp;ll=42.35171,-83.064065&amp;spn=0.007469,0.017638&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">422 W.

      <p><a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a> is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&#0160; It&#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.</p><p>Priority one is a book purge; I&#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house.</p><p>Priority two is an internet purge, looking at the online services that absorb time (and money some times) and seeing which ones I can do without.&#0160; This means that every single email that comes into the inbox for the next few days gets the query &quot;how do I get rid of this&quot;.</p><p>Priority three is a kitchen purge, looking at the emergency cupboard for the food that will never be eaten by us and should be donated, and looking for spare utensils and containers that could go.</p><p>Properly done, this is a year round effort, the sort of effort that has a box in your house that is the designated spot to send things off to the Reuse Center or some other organized recycling process.&#0160; With two kids around the house the natural tendency is towards unmitigated clutter, but there&#39;s some way to counteract that.</p>

      <p><p>Here is the Penzey&#39;s Apple Pancake recipe&hellip;a morph from the Dutch Baby.
</p><div>&#0160;</div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup butter&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;<wbr />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</div>
<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup all-purpose flour</div>
<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup milk </div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt</div>
<div>2 medium baking apples, peeled and thinly sliced&#0160; (I used Braeburn apples)</div>
<div>3 Tbs sugar</div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp ceylon cinnamon</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Preheat oven to 400.&#0160; divide butter between two 9&quot; pie plates and
put them in the oven to melt the butter.&#0160; Rotate to be sure that butter
covers bottom and&#0160; sides of pans.&#0160; Use a 4 cup measuring cup as a
mixing bowl (makes it easy to divide the batter).&#0160; Beat eggs, flour,
milk and salt on medium speed for 1 minute.&#0160; Divide the apple slices
between the pans and pour <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the egg mixture over each pan.&#0160; Mix
the cinnamin and sugar and sprinkle over the batter.&#0160; Bake until puffed
and folden brown&#0160; 20-25 minutes.&#0160; Serve right away, while still puffy,
with warm syrup.&#0160; </div></p>

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Serves 4-6&#0160;&#0160; Prep time 10 minutes, baking time&#0160; 20-25 minutes. <br /><br />and the report from up north from March 18, 2009:<br /></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Over the weekend we put 28 taps in our maple sugar trees.&#0160;&#0160; We
collected 8 gallons the first day but the next two nights were not
below freezing.&#0160; We have only 17 gallons so far.&#0160; It was cold last
night so the sap should run today.&#0160; Snowshoes are very necessary as the
<span class="il">snow</span> is &quot;punky&quot;.&#0160; Even with snowshoes we
sometimes break through the crust and one leg goes down 1 foot...makes
for slow going.&#0160; Hopefully we have a good wide track packed now.&#0160; </div>

<br /></p>

<p><br />&quot;SS: Oh, okay! Yeah, no, I haven&#39;t had a lot of time to pay
attention to our statistics yet, but I will at the end of this month.
It just rolled out April 1st. Our area associations, I imagine, are
going to want to embed this&ndash;and we encourage them to&ndash;in their own
webpages. For instance, Main Street Area Association, and State Street
Area Association. There are a lot of them, these associations and other
organizations, who could really benefit from it, especially if you&#39;re
going to have an event, you&#39;re telling your attendees to come downtown.
