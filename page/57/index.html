<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup all-purpose flour</div>
<div><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup milk </div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt</div>
<div>2 medium baking apples, peeled and thinly sliced&#0160; (I used Braeburn apples)</div>
<div>3 Tbs sugar</div>
<div><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp ceylon cinnamon</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Preheat oven to 400.&#0160; divide butter between two 9&quot; pie plates and
put them in the oven to melt the butter.&#0160; Rotate to be sure that butter
covers bottom and&#0160; sides of pans.&#0160; Use a 4 cup measuring cup as a
mixing bowl (makes it easy to divide the batter).&#0160; Beat eggs, flour,
milk and salt on medium speed for 1 minute.&#0160; Divide the apple slices
between the pans and pour <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the egg mixture over each pan.&#0160; Mix
the cinnamin and sugar and sprinkle over the batter.&#0160; Bake until puffed
and folden brown&#0160; 20-25 minutes.&#0160; Serve right away, while still puffy,
with warm syrup.&#0160; </div></p>

<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Serves 4-6&#0160;&#0160; Prep time 10 minutes, baking time&#0160; 20-25 minutes. <br /><br />and the report from up north from March 18, 2009:<br /></div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>Over the weekend we put 28 taps in our maple sugar trees.&#0160;&#0160; We
collected 8 gallons the first day but the next two nights were not
below freezing.&#0160; We have only 17 gallons so far.&#0160; It was cold last
night so the sap should run today.&#0160; Snowshoes are very necessary as the
<span class="il">snow</span> is &quot;punky&quot;.&#0160; Even with snowshoes we
sometimes break through the crust and one leg goes down 1 foot...makes
for slow going.&#0160; Hopefully we have a good wide track packed now.&#0160; </div>

<p><br />&quot;SS: Oh, okay! Yeah, no, I haven&#39;t had a lot of time to pay
attention to our statistics yet, but I will at the end of this month.
It just rolled out April 1st. Our area associations, I imagine, are
going to want to embed this&ndash;and we encourage them to&ndash;in their own
webpages. For instance, Main Street Area Association, and State Street
Area Association. There are a lot of them, these associations and other
organizations, who could really benefit from it, especially if you&#39;re

Vernon, Alabama<br />
Friday, December 24, 1886</p><p>
THE STORY OF MAD-STONE<br />
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]<br />
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all<br />
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,<br />
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison.<br />
This stone has something of a history. In 1848 Captain Wilson, of<br />
Alabama, killed a white deer in Talladega County, and search was made<br />
in the stomach for a stone. One was found a little larger than a<br />
goose-egg, with a flat surface on one side It resembled a petrified<br />
sponge. The stone up to this time has been used in upward of one<br />
thousand cases. Captain Wilson gave the stone to Mr. Cowan, who lives<br />
near Handley, in this county. Mr. Cowan, as a token of great<br />
friendship, gave the stone to W. R. Sanner, who would part with it for<br />
no amount. The philosophy of the operation of the stone and the reason<br />
it is found in the stomach of the white deer is given by the Indians<br />
as follows: &quot;The white deer is more susceptible to vegetable poisons<br />
taken into the stomach when eaten with grass. To preserve the life of<br />
the animal, nature has placed in the stomach this porous stone, which<br />
at once absorbs the poison, neutralizes it, and saves the deer&#39;s life.<br />

have a little more time to take in information and to have a discussion
with retailers. Rapundalo asked Bryan Weinert, the solid-waste
coordinator for the city of Ann Arbor, to give an update on staff
efforts. Weinert said that on March 22-23 staff would be meeting with
retailers to get feedback on the already-drafted ordinance. He said
there would be information on city’s website and a public information
survey, acknowledging that there was some controversy surrounding the
issue.&#0160; Weinert said that based on feedback from the public and
merchants, staff would bring forward a recommendation. Weinert did not
state what the range of possibilities for such a recommendation would
be.</p><p>Plastic bag manufacturers are not immune to the current economic stress; <a href="http://hilexpoly.com/news/single/article/hilex-poly-announces-agreement-to-restructure-debt-15//nbp/170.html">one leading manufacturer, Hilex Poly, just went through Ch. 11 bankruptcy (restructuring of debt) in 2008.</a></p><p class="bodytext" style="margin-left: 40px;">HARTSVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA – May 6, 2008 – Hilex

Statistics show that 10% to 15% of the parking spaces in garages are not used, even when the garage appears full. In a parking structure such as Century City with 2,500 spaces, that means that at any given time, the garage could “appear” full, but it would have 200 to 400 spaces available. “You just couldn’t find them, at least not easily,” deWildt says. “It’s like we had built a 400-space garage.”

A salesman for himself and his vision of the American dream, he was also a master peddler of many products, whose makers were as loyal to Harvey as his listeners. A skit from the 1984-85 season of Saturday Night Live had Harvey (played by Rich Hall) compulsively peppering his news items with sponsor names. The man remained unapologetic. "Some days," he told Larry King in 1988, "the best news in the broadcast is the commercial. You can keep your natural teeth all your natural life! There is a glove that doesn't wear out! There is a car battery that keeps its promises! That's good news! And I would use those things on the air if they were not in the body of the commercial."

<p>
A 2002 story in the <a href="http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2002/07/08/daily26.html">Dayton Business Journal</a> gives some sense for their scope of operations:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded in 1999 by Steve Buchholz, serves nearly 40,000 associations, chambers of commerce and mall or shopping centers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
By 2004, when Certifichecks had signed up a network of Christian-owned hotels, they had grown substantially, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2004/10/25/daily5.html">as noted in the Dayton Business Journal</a>:
</p><blockquote><p>
CertifiChecks, founded locally by Steve Buchholz in 1999, now has about 72,000 restaurant associations, chambers of commerce and bed and breakfast associations as customers nationwide.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
News is starting to trickle in about the impact of this. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/02/chamber_fumes_as_widespread_gi.html">From Muskegon, MI, Chad Lerch of the Muskegon Chronicle writes in the story Muskegon Chamber fumes as widespread CertifiChecks gift checks bounce</a>


</p><blockquote><p>
MUSKEGON COUNTY -- An Ohio-based company that offers gift checks for retailers abruptly closed Thursday, leaving West Michigan chambers of commerce, merchants and shoppers fuming and searching for answers.


Cindy Larsen, president of the Muskegon Area Chamber of Commerce, said up to $150,000 worth of gift checks for &quot;Muskegon Money&quot; could still be unspent.

If that&#39;s the case, a myriad of shoppers are holding checks that are worthless -- at least for now.

&quot;We&#39;re freaking out,&quot; Larsen said. &quot;We&#39;re freaking out because we&#39;re worried that someone is going to get stuck.&quot;
</p></blockquote><p>More will certainly come out of this story - if Certifichecks really has this many subscribers, gift cards and gift certificates are going to start bouncing all over the country.</p>

      <p><p>Every once in a while you find a smallish wiki that looks like it&#39;s healthy and has interesting material. &#0160;These wikis are bigger than the single person brain-dump, and smaller than Wikipedia, and less abandoned than most temporary bouts of enthusiasm that bring people into wiki-land.</p><br /><div>Inevitably when I find one of these I have the urge to edit and organize just long enough to figure out what kind of stuff is in it. &#0160;Sometimes the wiki authors so much assume that everyone knows what some key terms or concepts are, and so those things never get their own pages until you wander in and link them. &#0160;Other times the wiki authorship collectively is so interesting in making links to things that they never manage to get around to putting pages at the other end of the links. &#0160;Doing a round of edits to random pages to try to improve them just enough to make sense of them is a way to figure out whether you want to wrap your brain more about the topic.</div><br /><div>Wikipedia, in its timeless charmless categorical imperative way, calls the sort of people who wander into a wiki and start tidying things up as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GNOME">WikiGnomes</a>. &#0160;This is a passive-aggressive way of saying &quot;who the hell are you and why are you editing all of these pages and not adding anything to them&quot;. &#0160; If someone else calls you that, step back and head back to your blog. &#0160;The other term of art for this is &quot;Wiki gardening&quot;, which implies some low-level drone job pulling weeds and fixing other people&#39;s punctuation, which also completely misses the point.</div><br /><div>Sometimes, in order to make your own sense of something, you have to change it and see if it changes back after you touch it.</div><br /><div>(Written on the occasion of <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org">wandering into the Code4Lib wiki</a>, making a dozen changes, and stepping back.)</div></p>

<p></ul>
<div>That discussion pointed to this essay by <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/leader.html">Phil Agre on How To Be A Leader In Your Field</a> (2005), aimed at grad students. &#0160;He has a six part recipe (more pointless numbered lists; but you understand that as a grounding principle) on how to do it. &#0160;Starkly abstracted:</div><div><ol>
<li><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times">Pick an issue. You need an issue that the profession as a whole is not really thinking about, but which is going to be the center of attention in five years.&#0160;</p></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Having chosen your issue, start a project to study it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Find relevant people and talk to them. First do your library work so you know any conventional wisdom that&#39;s out there. Then talk to some working professionals who are facing the issue, especially if they have spoken publicly about an aspect of it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Pull together what you&#39;ve heard. Nobody is expecting you to solve the problems.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Circulate the result. Send copies to the people who helped you. Call it a draft or interim report if you want. Give credit to the people whose ideas you&#39;ve written down. Then follow up.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Build on your work. Get invited to speak at meetings. Correspond with people who have contacted you after reading your work.</span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</li>
</ol>
<span>Note that Agre&#39;s list has five steps before the &quot;speak at meetings&quot;, and that Marick&#39;s list only has&#0160;</span>&#0160;two; you can chalk up most of that to the need in grad school to engage in more ritual behavior vs. the practitioner who is just looking to talk about something novel to the people who want to hear something novel.<br /></div><br /><div>&ndash;</div><br /><div>I write about this stuff all the time, because in part I think about the tag line this blog has now (&quot;I am a leader by default, because nature abhors a vacuum&quot;) and how it reflects on the leadership role of seeing something not yet there and working at it until it is real enough for others to take as their own. &#0160;Hard to say that this is an easy path to do - if you are too scatterbrained you have dozens of projects that are not quite full formed and you never get to the expert level - but there is something to be said for the notion that this is something which you or anyone can do by simple application of diligence and leverage in some small gap in the structure of how the world currently is.</div></p>

Easing some tasks and eliminating others, new commercial processes inexorably altered women&#39;s daily lives and relationships—with each other and with those they served.<br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;">There&#39;s some additional line of thinking I&#39;d like to go down - a patent search - here&#39;s some from the 1920s that show up:</div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><br /></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=VCdhAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=sears+vacuum#PPA3,M1">1699598</a>&#0160;-&#0160;<span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; line-height: 15px; ">Objects of the invention are:—to equalize the pressure of air passing through all points of the air inlet orifice of a vacuum cleaner; 10 to enable a surface to be efficiently cleaned in corners with a minimum of change of position of the machine; to prevent the curling upward of the margins of rugs, loosely laid carpets,&quot;or other fabrics by the suction 15 when a vacuum cleaner is moved across their edges; to simplify the assembling and disassembling of the operating mechanism and otherwise to increase the efficiency, improve the operation and simplify the arrangement 20 of parts of traveling vacuum cleaners.</span></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 15px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><a href="http://www.vdta.com/hof-list.html">aha, much much more from the Vacuum Dealers Trade Association - A Vacuum and Sewing Hall of Fame!.. stopping now.</a></div><div style="text-indent: -11px;"><span style="font-family: -webkit-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 15px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;"><br /></span></div></span></p>

      <p><p>Typepad says that I have 2,000 posts in this weblog. &#0160;Some of them, to be sure, are drafts that were abandoned, and some are scheduled in the future, but that&#39;s as good a round number as I need to reflect on blogging (the practice and the habit).</p><div><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html">I&#39;ve been blogging since April 1999; here&#39;s the first month or so of posts. &#0160;</a>&#0160;&#0160;They were edited oh so patiently with vi, and at the time the genre was new enough that I could say with confidence &quot;Huh, this daily weblog stuff is too hard. &quot; and have that be a novel observation. &#0160; &#0160;Jorn Barger at the time noted in his Robot Wisdom blog<span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; "></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&quot;New weblog from Ed Vielmetti, who&#39;s been on the Net forever.&quot; &#0160;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal;"><br /></span></div><div><span>Ten years later I&#39;m still at it. &#0160;I suppose that I might have just enough experience in blogging that even I would think of myself as an expert at it, for what that&#39;s worth. &#0160;(As Forbes once said about my bright ideas, &quot;Too bad everyone else had the same idea.&quot;) And like any good blogger, I have a nice pat seven item list to share with you - because people who read blogs love pointless numbered lists.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>1. &#0160;Repetition is the soul of the net. &#0160;If I&#39;ve told you this once, I&#39;ve said it a thousand times. &#0160;Every year, regular as clockwork, there is an audience for people reading about where to pick blueberries, how to get election returns, who makes the best paczki, what to do on your birthday or your kids birthday. &#0160;You get a free pass to repeat your good content over and over again annually, do it.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>2. &#0160;Don&#39;t think too much. &#0160;Think more, perhaps, than you would in writing a 140 character twitter message; think twice before saying something that you&#39;d regret before a judge or in print. &#0160;But don&#39;t think more than twice, and be prepared to post something before it&#39;s absolutely polished and done. &#0160;Sometimes the people who read what you are writing will fill in the blanks for you.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>3. &#0160;Omit needless words. &#0160;Your screen is small, and the day is short. &#0160;Don&#39;t ramble on and on - fill the text input box until it&#39;s full, and hit post.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>4. &#0160;Leave comments. &#0160;Comments on other people&#39;s blogs will remind them of stuff that you have collected that&#39;s relevant; comments on your own blog will let you update things that are changing without going back and re-editing. &#0160;Every once in a while, you&#39;ll unearth someone who is a bona fide expert who reads the news clippings you pasted together and gets an insight.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>5. &#0160;Don&#39;t feed the trolls. &#0160;(And there are so many of them.) &#0160;Squash idiot comments, commercial spam comments, irritating comments, stray trackbacks, and any other crud out of your blog as soon as you see it. &#0160;</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>6. &#0160;Did I mention pointless numbered lists? &#0160;Use them. &#0160;Everyone&#39;s attention span is short, and lists let people know just how far along they are before they can be done. &#0160;They let you jump from idea to idea without pesky transitions, and make it easy for someone else to cut and paste that one good idea hiding in your pile of dreck and take it for their own.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>7. &#0160;Quote liberally (and credit liberally). &#0160;Half the battle in blogging is figuring out who knows more than you do about something; the other half the battle is figuring out who is uselessly ignorant but still writes a lot. &#0160;If you are good and thorough and relentless in clipping out good paragraphs from other people&#39;s work, and you are good and thorough and relentless in doing the searches that end up in results that aren&#39;t on everyone else&#39;s front page of Google, you can learn a lot and share a lot.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>I&#39;ve been averaging a post a day for a long time. &#0160;Some days more, some days less, and some blogs are mercifully left for dead from ideas that didn&#39;t pan out. &#0160;I wish I knew what it all meant. &#0160;In some ways it reminds me a lot of my short lived but illustrious high school forensics career of impromptu speaking - all it really shows is that you can be coherent on short notice about pretty much anything, and that you have enough diligence to keep being coherent for a long time.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>If someone can tell me what career that qualifies me for, please let me know - I&#39;m looking.</span></div></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A new breed of general-purpose manycore computing platform is
emerging. Exemplary examples include the Niagara from Sun Microsystems,
the G80 from Nvidia, the Cell from IBM, and the up-coming Larrabee from
Intel. These manycore processors each pack 8-32 relatively simple cores
on a chip, capable of supporting up to 100s of threads, and boast
tremendous potential peak single-chip performances up to the range of
Tera-FLOPS. However, traditional algorithms and applications in many
domains cannot take advantage of much of the parallelism provided by
these platforms. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The ParLab at Berkeley was recently founded in part to help
meet this acute need for novel algorithmic approaches to unleash the
performance potentials of emerging manycore platforms for a wide range
of application domains. It proposes to concentrate on analyzing the
communication and computation patterns (or Dwarfs) of important classes
of algorithms underlying modern application domains, and develop
techniques to efficiently parallelize them for the general purpose
manycore platforms.
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">We concentrate on the domain of image recognition and
retrieval, leveraging the Intel PIRO content-based image retrieval
framework as a motivating application. Specifically, we study the
parallelization of classification algorithms for machine learning, and
develop parallelization techniques to improve the performance of these
algorithms and applications on the emerging manycore platforms.</p><p><a href="http://www.bv2.co.uk/?p=281">Here&#39;s a discussion of an OCR system that uses the CUDA libraries called cocr</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The cuda implementation allows for exceptionally fast image

although cocr is by no means a complete ocr package it is orders of

more work and an additional of a neural network ocr it could easily

File No. 2006-014.17 (mgn)</em></p>
<p><em>We are writing to inform you of the recent investigation and
analysis that was performed on the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S.
State Street.&#0160; We are also reporting on the condition of the bridge and
providing information regarding possible short- and long-term solutions
for the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street and the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.</em></p>
<p><em>Attached, please find a Traffic Control Order (TCO) that
recommends a reduction in allowable gross vehicle weights for the E.
Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street in accordance with the
limits contained in this memorandum.</em></p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>On December 29, 2007, our Field Operations forces were called
out to the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over S. State Street as
medium-sized pieces of concrete were falling off of the bottom of one
of the box beams that support the roadway.&#0160; These pieces of concrete
were large enough to damage passing vehicles, if they were to strike
them.&#0160; Our Field Operations and Safety Services personnel closed one
lane of traffic at a time and removed the remaining loose concrete from
the underside of the box beam.&#0160; No injuries due to the falling concrete
were reported.</em></p>
<p><em>As a result of the concrete removal, we reviewed the structure
again and were concerned about the condition of one of the box beams.&#0160;
In early January 2008, a meeting was held on-site between Project
Management Unit, our bridge inspection consultant, and bridge design
personnel to review the condition of the bridge and (1) determine what
possible courses of action could be taken to help prevent further
damage to the bridge and (2) identify possible repair strategies.</em></p>
<p><em>We directed our consultants to re-analyze the bridge structure
given the section loss that had just occurred.&#0160; As you may recall,
effective January 1, 2008 we lowered the weight limits due to section
loss that was discovered during the biennial inspection that was
performed in late October 2007.&#0160; Based upon the new analysis that was
performed in January 2008, it is recommended that we reduce the weight
limits on this structure again.<br />
Condition of the bridge</em></p>
<p><em>The existing bridge is composed of 16 pre-stressed concrete box
beams that are laid side-by-side.&#0160; They are “tied” together with steel
post-tensioning rods that connect pairs of beams together.&#0160; The beams
are overlaid with an asphalt wearing surface.&#0160; There is a concrete
sidewalk that has been cast on top of the two northernmost beams.&#0160; The
bridge does not provide sufficient vertical or horizontal clearances
and is considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the box beams has developed a severe longitudinal crack.&#0160;
This is the beam that our field personnel had to hand-chip to remove
the spalled concrete in late December 2007.&#0160; There are other beams that
are developing longitudinal cracks, as well.&#0160; Other beams have several
broken pre-stressing strands and the abutments that support the beams
are in poor condition.&#0160; Note that the pre-stressing strands are the
primary elements of the bridge beams that provide structural strength.&#0160;
Based on these deficiencies, the bridge, viewed as a whole, is
considered to be in poor condition.&#0160; The beam that is severely cracked
is considered to be in serious condition.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon review of the “as-built” drawings of the structure, we
believe that it is not possible to repair the severely cracked beam in
any manner that can restore its structural integrity.&#0160; This is due to
the location of the beam itself, and the location and configuration of
the post-tensioning rods that tie the box beams together.&#0160; The severely
cracked beam is the fifth beam in from the south side of the
structure.&#0160; Due to the manner in which the bridge was constructed, it
is not possible to replace only this beam. In order to repair the beam,
we would have to cut the post tensioning rods on each side of the
beam.&#0160; We would not be able to access the needed areas of the beams to
re-install the post-tensioning rods, however, effectively leaving the
beams to function individually.&#0160; This would be unacceptable.&#0160; There is
also one other beam that contains small cracks that currently are not
as severe as the beam described above, but we believe that it is likely
that it, too, will crack in a similar manner.&#0160; AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE
IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO REPLACE AT LEAST FIVE BEAMS ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THE BRIDGE, AND POSSIBLY AS MANY AS EIGHT.</em></p>
<p><em>Exacerbating the problem is the condition of the remaining
beams.&#0160; We believe that it is likely that the tops of these beams have
begun to spall.&#0160; It is apparent to us that salt-laden water has seeped
between the asphalt layer covering the beams and the beams themselves.&#0160;
Water routinely leaks around the beams and runs down the abutment
walls.&#0160; Over time, this moisture and salt will cause the concrete to
disintegrate.&#0160; Given the length of time this has been occurring, we
have reason to believe that it is possible that the tops of the beams
are damaged to the point that they may not be able to be repaired, if
we were to attempt it.</em></p>
<p><em>We also believe that any attempt at performing a repair itself
would be expensive.&#0160; We do not have detailed costs at this time, but we
estimate that it would cost at least $250,000 to attempt to replace the
five to eight south side bridge beams.&#0160; Also, it would take at least
one month to perform the needed construction.</em></p>
<p><em>At your request, we could prepare a more thorough and detailed
estimate of the repair costs and other possible options that could be
implemented should funding for the replacement of the structure not be
available in the foreseeable future.&#0160; This evaluation would cost
approximately $15,000 to retain the services of a structural engineer
to analyze and review various options.&#0160; We also recommend that about
$10,000 be budgeted for our Field Services personnel to assist in the
performance forensic investigations on the bridge in order to better
determine the extent of deterioration of the existing bridge beams and
abutments.</em></p>
<p><em>We do not believe that it is possible to repair the bridge over
S. State Street cost effectively, however.&#0160; This is due to the
extensive deterioration of the existing beams, abutments, and
asphalt-wearing surface.&#0160; As mentioned previously, the bridge is
considered structurally deficient and functionally obsolete.&#0160; These
deficiencies cannot be easily remedied.&#0160; We will, of course, continue
to monitor the condition of the bridge. Should it become necessary, we
are prepared to repair the structure in order to allow the bridge to
remain in service.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Short-term Action</em></p>
<p><em>In order to help minimize damage to this structure and prolong
its life span to the greatest extent possible, we are recommending that
the weight limits be lowered.&#0160; We have prepared the following table
that compares the existing and proposed weight limits for the three
classes of trucks that can use the structure:</em></p>
<p><em>Design<br />
Vehicle&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Existing<br />
Posted Load<br />
(since January 1, 2008)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Proposed<br />
Posted Load&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Reduction in<br />
Load carrying capacity<br />
Single Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 31 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 19 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Two-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 24 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 39%<br />
Three-Unit Truck&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 44 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 26 tons&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; 41%</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed Traffic Control Order (TCO) recommends a reduction
in gross vehicle weight for the three types of trucks that can travel
on Michigan roadways without special permits.&#0160; They are one, two, and
three-unit trucks.&#0160; A single-unit truck is any truck without a
trailer.&#0160; A single-unit truck can be any number of common vehicles.&#0160;
Some examples of this would be a school or AATA bus, moving van, or in
the worst case, a fully loaded concrete truck.&#0160; A two-unit truck can be
most easily described as a semi-truck with one trailer.&#0160; Note, a
pick-up truck or car pulling an “ordinary” trailer (such as the
trailers that lawn maintenance companies would use) would not be
considered a two-unit vehicle. Finally, a three-unit truck can be most
easily thought of as a semi-truck pulling two trailers.&#0160; An example of
this would be the large sand or gravel hauling trucks that bring
materials to construction sites.</em></p>
<p><em>The recommended gross vehicle weight reductions are
significant.&#0160; Also, the overall condition of the bridge has declined
measurably over the course of the last calendar year.&#0160; We expect that
the condition of the structure will continue to decline as the
structure is nearing the end of its useful life.&#0160; Based on the rate of
deterioration that we have observed over the course of the last few
years, we believe that the structure has approximately three to five
years in which it will be able to carry trucks.&#0160; We also expect that
additional weight limit restrictions will be necessary in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Proposed Long-term Actions</em></p>
<p><em>As you may recall, we have begun a project to perform the
preliminary design of the replacement for this structure, as well as
the E. Stadium Boulevard Bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks.&#0160;
The bridge over the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks is located about 300 feet
to the west of the bridge over S. State Street.&#0160; We believe it makes
sense to consider replacing both bridges at the same time, although it
is also possible to replace the two bridge structures at different
times.</em></p>
<p><em>We have not able to move forward on the preliminary design of
the bridge over S. State Street or the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks
because we are waiting for the 4th Ward City Council members to
nominate and confirm a Citizens Advisory Committee to assist us with
the public engagement process.&#0160; It has been our experience with
projects of this nature that it is important to consider and review all
aspects of the proposed design with the citizens in order to make sure
the project that we deliver meets community expectations.&#0160; This process
will also help us to avoid conflicts later in the design process as we
will have already confirmed the design approach and aesthetics of the
project with the public and City Council.&#0160; Finally, this preliminary
design process will allow us to better estimate the cost of the project
based on a more complete picture of all project elements.</em></p>
<p><em>We have estimated that it will take about 2 to 3 years to
prepare for bridge replacement including the public engagement and
internal project review process; the preliminary and final design of
the bridges and needed approach work; and the development of a funding
plan for the project.&#0160; We have prepared a tentative schedule for this
project such that its construction could be started shortly after the
University of Michigan’s Football Stadium Renovations are completed.&#0160;
We are also planning and coordinating this project so that it is
compatible with the planned improvements along W. Stadium Boulevard.&#0160;
Attached, please find a drawing that we have prepared that locates all
of these planned improvements and their anticipated starting and
completion dates.&#0160; Also attached, please find the tentative project
schedule that details the required tasks and estimated durations of the
required activities to complete the project’s design.</em></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p><em>Fortunately, the reduction in weights that we are proposing does
not yet affect most of the everyday users of this structure.&#0160; However,
we believe that when it is again necessary to reduce the posted weight
limits, both AATA and the Ann Arbor Public Schools will be impacted by
this change.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed change will impact the trucking and construction
operations that use this corridor as they, most probably, will not be
able to route trucks through this portion of the E. Stadium Boulevard
corridor between S. Industrial Highway and S. Main Street.&#0160; These types
of trucks will have to find an alternative route around this portion of
E. Stadium Boulevard.</em></p>
<p><em>We are also working with the Communications Office to prepare a
press release notifying the appropriate agencies of the proposed change.</em></p>

more people have come to this site looking for from-scratch blueberry
muffins than, as far as I can tell by the search terms that lead people
here, anything else. I&#39;ve been feeling sort of guilty: that post was
such a tease. Unfortunately, blueberries are definitely out of season
during these dark days; but maybe you stashed some in your refrigerator
last August...</p><p><a href="http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=337987">a recipe from amyburns1999 on SparkPeople for Blueberry Cardamom Muffins</a>; it&#39;s vegan, should that be relevant to you.&#0160; (personally, skip the splenda, but that&#39;s me)</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">These are so delicious you should make a double batch so you can freeze
some for later or share with friends. I normally substitute the sugar
with splenda for less calories.<br /><span class="gray12"><em>45 Minutes to Prepare and Cook</em></span><br /><br /><br /></div>

 <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><p>surprisingly - there were not a lot of these recipes that were easy to find on the first go-around; that might have been just because the general rule is &quot;optional: add some other spice to taste&quot;.&#0160; will report back after I experiment.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This bit of an exchange from a mailing list has been stuck in my inbox for more than a year, time to post it.&#0160; It was about <a href="http://chi.mp/">Chi.mp</a>, a &quot;content hub and identity management portal&quot;.</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">People using Chi.mp will have identities that are importable, exportable, interoperable, portable and most importantly theirs. 


<br /></div><p><br />and I can&#39;t help but think of this from the magazine In Formation #2, part of the late dot-com era:
</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/03/every-day-compu.html%20">Every day computers are making people easier and easier to use.


</a><br /></div><p><br />Come on people, don&#39;t believe that you can
create a world where the bits in the system
are a perfect mirror of who you are. Individual
identities are not something that can be reduced
to microformats. I can change my mind, and not
have to go back and update a zillion web pages to
reflect that change of mind. Whatever you are
calling &quot;identity&quot; here is emphatically not what
human beings think of as their identity; perhaps
if you replaced it with &quot;dossier&quot; the nature of
the data gathering would be more clear in a historical
context (think Stasi, for instance, instead of Facebook).</p><p>To the extent that your personal data projected onto the internet
(or onto the financial networks or the astral plane) is a reflection of
you, then in some real sense it is you.
</p><p>I&#39;ll stay very skeptical that by standardizing a microformat that we
can easily update that we can somehow &quot;control our own identity&quot;.
How much of your personal identity (or the data that reflects some
aspect of your personal identity) is really stored on servers and systems
and for that matter on paper beyond your immediate control? After all,
I have a dossier (er, Address Book entry) which you can&#39;t update at
will. If you change names, change jobs, or change ideas about what
your Self is, that&#39;s going to take some time to percolate through The System,
and some parts of it will be unchangable just like the name you never
use now but that people who knew you from when you were little still
call you.</p>
