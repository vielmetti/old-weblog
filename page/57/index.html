Ed Vielmetti&#039;s Vacuum is a new weblog that focuses mostly on Ann Arbor. [Wow!] With that thought, it&#039;d be pretty cool to see weblogs pop up that cater to folks in San Francisco, New York City and Austin. Any takers?

        <p>A neighbor got a citation for his day lilies, which were in violation of something; I haven&#39;t seen the actual paper he got to know which chapter and verse of city code they violated.
Looking through it I see Chapter 47 STREETS and section 4:2

        <p>From Skepticism to Citizen Journalism via a Tea Party « Emerging Technologies Librarian I learned to mistrust the US popular press several years ago. A friend of mine is positioned high enough in the military to have a sense of the big picture and low enough to have a sense of what is going on in the lives of the “grunts”.

Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.
