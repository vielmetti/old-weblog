<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>day 3 notes</p><p>I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.</p><p>In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89.1 WEMU FM; and Dave Gershman from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; Some part of the DDA meeting was also recorded by video cameras; I haven&#39;t figured out yet how to replay that.</p><p>It&#39;s instructive to see the different viewpoints that these three media channels provide, and to figure out what added perspective you could get from it.</p><p>Dave Askins was twittering out notes on <a href="http://twitter.com/A2ChronicleMeet">@A2ChronicleMeet</a> with a running play by play.&#0160; I&#39;m certain that it will be part of the raw materials for a long, descriptive, detailed account of the meeting, complete with bits of reflection on logos on garbage cans and the ins and outs of what roles and responsibilities flow to the mayor pro tem.&#0160; Dave gave a great talk at <a href="http://igniteannarbor.com">Ignite Ann Arbor</a> 1 the previous night about how the extremely descriptive style of news that the Chronicle publishes serves them well in reviewing things long after the fact, even if wading through 7000 words seems like a bit long for right now in a world where reporters are used to publishing 500 or 1000.</p><p>Andrew Cluely from WEMU was in the back taking a few notes, and he had his recorder out front at the end of the meeting with one of the board members.&#0160; I looked online really hard for where the story might have been posted already, and came up at best with <a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wemu/news.newsmain?action=search&amp;advanced=true&amp;newSearch=true&amp;searchOption=1&amp;TEASE_WORDS=cluley&amp;BYLINE_WORDS=&amp;Submit=Search">this page where it might be</a>, buried deep on a search string.&#0160; There&#39;s some wasted opportunity here, since the same-day audio clip is going to give you a perspective on decisions later - if, and only if, you can find it again.</p><p>Dave Gershman filed two stories from the Ann Arbor News - one on how the DDA&#39;s <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/downtown_ann_arbor_mural_plan.html">decision on public arts funding impacts the murals proposed by Fire Up Downtown</a>, and one on how <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/07/ann_arbor_expects_federal_prog.html">federal stimulus money will save $1.5 million in financing costs for the Library Lot underground garage</a>.&#0160; The mural story attracted MLive&#39;s usual crowd of incredibly lame, rude, and anonymous commenters - people who didn&#39;t add any value to the story.</p><p>Now I know that there were a lot more stories to be told out of that event - the continuing saga of somewhat confused people figuring out how e-Park meters work, the continuing series of anecdotes about how the Maynard St structure is always full without any supporting data or analysis, and the parliamentary maneuvers about whether Leigh Greden should be able to vote in the seat reserved for the mayor as mayor pro tem.&#0160; </p><p>Where do you start with news?&#0160; Small town politics of parking meters.&#0160; I&#39;m told that new employees at the New York Times and returning international correspondents once worked the sanitation beat as their first stint (and I can&#39;t source that quote, even though I&#39;d like to, because I didn&#39;t bookmark that link).</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-movable-type-rich-text-editors-and-stripping-weird-tags/">Movable Type rich text editors and stripping weird tags</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Another part of day 3 -</p><p>We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript.&#0160; Microsoft Word is one version of that process; there&#39;s lots more paths that get there.</p><p>I know that when I used to use Typepad, that the rich text editor I had was pretty good about stripping out tags and attributes that were weird.&#0160; Font tags disappeared, for instance, which made it possible to be sure that stuff didn&#39;t show up as Comic Sans unless I really wanted them to be in Comic Sans.</p><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found out so far.</p><p><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/developer/rich-text-editors.html">MT supports multiple kinds of rich text editor abstractions.</a>&#0160; There&#39;s currently support for the YUI editor, for TinyMCE, and for FCK.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The relevant bit of configuration code is wrapped in<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <code>&lt;mt:setvarblock name=&quot;editor_content&quot;&gt;</code></p><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tinymce-mtplugin/">TinyMCE MT plugin source</a> posted on Google Code.&#0160; The current release, supporting Japanese and English, is in active development and is at version 0.1.11 as of 29 hours ago.</p><p>Richard Benson wrote and supports the <a href="http://www.richardbenson.co.uk/projects/yui-rich-text-editor-in-movabl.html?utm_source=mt-plugins&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=yui-editor">YUI MT plugin</a>, which is at version 1.3.</p><p>Now, to the actual MT rich text editor:</p><p>A rant from<a accesskey="1" href="http://padawan.info/en/2007/07/upgrading-to-mt.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>François Nonnenmacher</a> about the HTML generated by the MT rich text editor:</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>The Rich Text Editor produces tons of ugly fucking code behind the screen</strong>, especially when using Safari. So it&#39;s an <a href="http://padawan.info/web/oldschool_rich_text_editors.html">old-school editor</a> such <a href="http://padawan.info/web/midas.html">Midas</a>, only a slight improvement over <abbr title="What You See Is Fucking Ugly Code">WYSIFUC</abbr> in the sense that it hides it from you (unless you select &quot;none&quot; in the Format menu or &quot;HTML Mode&quot; and scream in horror at the <abbr title="Fucking Ugly Code">FUC</abbr>
it generates, like &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style:
italic;&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;!). For
example, on Safari it generates a DIV per paragraph, while on Firefox
it just spits out &lt;br&gt; tags or cosmetic &lt;i&gt; or &lt;b&gt;
tags (not even &lt;br /&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt; tags, mind
you).<br /></div><p><br />And generally that&#39;s my experience to date; weird tags, bad semantics, and unpredictable behavior.&#0160; What I don&#39;t know yet (and hope to figure out) is what the data path is through the system that would let things be cleaned up and filtered on the back end so that they are consistent, or fixed on the front end so that the generated code from the rich text editor is better.</p><p>The funny thing is, this used to work better: old versions of Typepad, and old versions of MT, both had a very conservative rich text editor that denatured the text quite a bit, removing a lot of tags and operating in &quot;safe mode&quot; much more so than &quot;rich mode&quot;.</p><p>a puzzle...</p>

      <p>So, I have a new Blackberry replacing my old Blackberry.&#0160; The new device has a camera in it, which I never had before in a phone.&#0160; So therefore I need to figure out how to get pictures from the phone to the various places I put pictures now and understand the path.</p><p>Facebook: My phone has a Facebook app - it was even pre-installed.&#0160; So the camera has a &quot;Send to Facebook&quot; menu entry, which sends it up.&#0160; <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/features/social/facebook.jsp#tab_tab_start">Here&#39;s a few docs.</a>&#0160; I&#39;ve used this already, it&#39;s fast and easy.</p><p>Twitter.&#0160; The service that I&#39;ve seen people use that seems like it works pretty well is <a href="http://twitpic.com/">Twitpic</a>; it was good enough to capture <a href="http://twitpic.com/135xa">a plane landing on the Hudson</a>.&#0160; To make it work, the consensus seems to be that the best way to go is to send the photo via email to your Twitpic address.&#0160; Haven&#39;t gotten that far yet.</p><p>Typepad.&#0160; <a href="http://www.typepad.com/features/blog-blackberry.html">Typepad has a Blackberry app</a>; haven&#39;t tried it yet. &#0160; </p><p>Flickr.&#0160; There&#39;s an existing &quot;email your photos to Flickr&quot; process; Flickr also allows you newly to announce new photos to Twitter.&#0160; <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/upload-photos-to-twitter-by-email/9092/">Here&#39;s a Flickr / Twitter tutorial.</a>&#0160; Again sounds like a good thing to work my way through, again haven&#39;t done it yet.</p><p>overall - my todo list looks like &quot;set up email&quot; next, which gets me Twitter/twitpic; then install the Blackberry app for Typepad; then dig into Flickr&#39;s config to post to Twitter.&#0160; If things work right, I will be able to show things they way they should be.</p>

                <div class="delicious-extended">In a phone conversation this morning, Kramer described the project as “an effort to move beyond banner ads,” which have proven lucrative for the site, but also limited. MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota. (That’s one reason the CPM is so good.) As a result, the site had several weeks this spring when marketers’ demand for advertising space exceeded the site’s supply of local readership.</div>

The great thing is technology allows us to have a virtual meeting online. Arm journalists with laptops, webcams and phones and call the editorial meeting wherever and whenever they are. Too long have journalists been removed from the people they serve. (If not in reality, at least in the minds and attitudes of our community members.)</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Encountered last week-end in Venice, Los Angeles. Still about press, I am fascinated by foreign press available as these A3 sheets of papers sold straight from the printer. Far from the complex e-paper technology, these very low-cost one-sided magazines show an interesting trend about the importance of physical artifacts. Besides, the name of this service (”paper direct”) is conspicuously relevant in these times of frenetic digitalization. Given that it’s printed locally, it’s an up-to-date instantiation (that prevent you from waiting two or three days to have the same newspaper coming from the guts of an Airbus/Boeing Cargo flight).</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">As a story plays out across the Network, as new information is uncovered, the inputs are routed through the mixing board of the writer’s keyboard. A writer must now listen to how the whole jam is sounding— the writer is a player down in the groove with other players. As we learn to write through a real-time medium, we’ll need to look to the values, standards and practices of live performance. But these performances aren’t necessarily the traditional one-to-many events unfolding within a proscenium. We’ll need to dig into the performance theories of Richard Schechner and the Happenings of Allan Kaprow; revive the thoughts of Michael Kirby and The Art of Time, and the work of Fluxus. The journey from text on a page to hypertext on the Network is not a small adjustment to a business model; it’s a transvaluation of all values.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Localism ain’t it, unless it undergoes a total transformation of focus away from trying to sell real estate.  The Local ain’t it, unless it too undergoes a transformation and embraces the community on which it is reporting — and in fact, actually does some, you know, reporting.  The answer may be in social media, like MaplewoodOnline and Baristanet, as more and more journalists leave the newspaper business (by choice or not) and end up having to learn whole new skills in web-based, local, community-powered media.</div>

                <div class="delicious-extended">Crisis communications used to be the handled exclusively through official channels like press releases, spokespeople and media relations. But today, through the power of socially distributed problem-solving, a first draft of history more nuanced and accurate than ever before is emerging from social media, and increasingly, people are turning to unofficial sources first, particularly in times of crisis.</p>

<p>In this episode, social media crisis communications researcher at the ConnectivIT Lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder Leysia Palen shares what she has learned about social media usage during a crisis, assessing the credibility of citizen journalism and user generated media during a crisis, and how organizations might align with unofficial back channels in the future.</div><br />

For the rest of his lifetime, he carried out the following editorial creed: &quot;What we want, and what we shall have is the royal American privilege of living and dying in a country town, running a country newspaper, saying what we please when we please, how we please and to whom we please.&quot;</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">Once people could no longer pick up the local gazette and find out who was visiting from California and when Helen Carter was going to sell her famous peach pies, the papers became less relevant to their lives.</p>

<p>Without that relevancy, society and democracy suffered. People became not only less informed, but less involved in their communities.</p>

<p>Consider that 57 percent of Americans say that if their local newspaper went away, both online and in print, they wouldn&#039;t miss it and it wouldn&#039;t hurt the civic life of their towns. The numbers are just as dismal when the question is isolated just to regular newspaper readers. This is in keeping with an earlier Harris poll that found nearly two-thirds of Americans say their local newspaper doesn&#039;t serve its community well.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">For more than a decade, we expected to build online news organizations that could support a super structure of the modern newspaper newsroom -- with the all the reporters and editors and big story packages (look at all the emphasis we put on big Flash multimedia productions) and that we could keep doing journalism just the way we always did it.</p>

<p>While we bemoaned shovelware (taking the same exact print story and repurposing it for the Web), we took little time to really examine what might might be different about online publishing that should change the way news is gathered and presented.</div><br />

                <div class="delicious-extended">I’ve been asking Mark Josephson that question for months, and now he has an answer: Josephson, the CEO of local news platform Outside.in, figures the local, online-only newspaper of tomorrow,  for a decent-sized city, will have a staff of 20 people. That’s 20 people, period. Perhaps 6 of them will be “news gatherers.”</p>

<p>    ..traffic volume has made it difficult for any but the wealthiest media operations to monitor user comments as diligently as they do letters to the editor or “talk backs” to news directors. The combination of virtually open access and limited oversight has turned these public squares into mosh pits, without the latter&#039;s youthful exuberance or bonhomie.</p>

<p>Trying to adhere to policies that work to keep rules in place without disrupting or silencing the passionate voices of their readers have challenged media operators. Yet, many news media have taken steps in striking a balance between quality and quantity.</div><br />

It describes the making of persimmon beer among Mississippi African-Americans. In and around Darlington, South Carolina, people would host outdoor gatherings and serve “chicken bog,” a distinctive chicken-and-rice dish. Nebraskans loved buffalo barbeque and Wisconsin folks enjoyed sour-dough pancakes.</div>

The commenter Robert Knilands (aka Wenalway) may seem your run-of-the-mill troll, but he expresses a virulent form of prejudice too frequently directed towards online and young journalists by some - and I stress, only some - print journalists. Robert Knilands says:</p>

<p>    It can’t survive, though, as long as young journos are getting opportunities they are unqualified for and posting ignorant blog entries. All that does is destroy the present and the future.</div><br />

      </h3>
      <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.</p>

<p>It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all.</p>

<br />Saturday June 27, 2009: 10:00 am to 11:30 am -- <br />Downtown Library:
Multi-Purpose Room
</p><div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">Bring your camera and explore Ann Arbor! Photowalk is a fun way to
capture photos of the beauty of Ann Arbor and then post them online
for all to see. Our first Photowalk is held in conjunction with the
Library’s summer reading program, Local Motion - which encourages the
use of local neighborhoods, gyms, recreational facilities and outdoor
areas to explore Ann Arbor and get fit. We will begin with
presentations by several local photography experts, including: Myra
Klarman, professional photographer specializing in studio and
lifestyle portraits, Michael C. Myers, local photographer and a
founding member of the Ann Arbor Crappy Camera Club, and Leisa
Thompson, Ann Arbor News Staff Photographer. Following the lecture, at
11:30 am, we will go out in small groups to photograph Ann Arbor. The
results will be an online exhibit of your photos in the aadl.org
pictureAnnArbor collection.
