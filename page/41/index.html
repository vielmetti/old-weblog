<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time it was del.icio.us, and it was the new cool way to use bookmarks and tagging, and I used it all the time. I put more than 10,000 bookmarks into the system. This was when Flickr was on the top of the world and before Facebook and Twitter had made much of a dent.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us turned into delicious.com, got bought by Yahoo. Some cool people started to work there supporting it. Yahoo gave it a loving embrace, and those cool people left to do other cool things. They warned me on their way out, and I moved <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">my 10,000 bookmarks</a> to <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_self">pinboard</a> and mostly stopped using both systems because I wasn&#39;t ready to invest heavily in something that other people didn&#39;t trust.</p>
<p>Yahoo sold delicious.com to the founders of Youtube, who now run a company called AVOS. By all accounts the transition hasn&#39;t gone very well, e.g. your most loyal users say that the system has been <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/avos-delicious-disaster-lessons-from-a-complete-failure/705" target="_self">mangled by carpetbaggers</a>. From Violet Blue on ZDNet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahoo! got caught with its finger on the trigger to kill Delicious, an amazing cry came up from the internets to save it. Then AVOS rode in on a white unicorn to save it. Yay!</p>
<p>But, no. What we got was our worst fears about the bubble, confirmed.</p>
<p>Delicious is a bitter lesson for everyone. It’s the difference between how people actually use a product versus how rich, out-of-touch knuckleheads think people&#0160;<strong>should be</strong>&#0160;using that product, all to further their own self-interests.</p>
<p>If you make a startup we like, such as Delicious: please don’t sell it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinboard has been doing well, but it&#39;s a one-person show with a very modest balance sheet.&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what to conclude about this phase of network history, other than to note that the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/07/cyberspace-is-gone.html" target="_self">anti-internet texts of the 1990s</a>&#0160;provide some small measure of solace, and that if you want to keep something that you find on the net&#0160;in order to find it again making a copy of it in addition to bookmarking it is appopriate.</p>

This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944.

      <p>The UARS satellite is making its way back to earth. Here's some parts of the ways to track it. (Think of it as research for your next disaster movie.)</p>
<p>On Twitter, the #<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23UARS" target="_self">UARS</a> hash tag has a lot of traffic. I'm following @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/UARS_Reentry" target="_self">UARS_Reentry</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/NASA" target="_self">NASA</a> and that's enough to get the summary information.</p>
<p>Heavens Above has an <a href="http://www2.heavens-above.com/orbitdisplay.aspx?icon=default&width=300&height=300&satid=21701">orbital display</a> with current location information; you'll need to refresh periodically.</p>
<p>I wouldn't know where to start looking on Facebook for information.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Atmosphere_Research_Satellite" target="_self">Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite</a> page is getting an edit every few minutes, as wikipedians try to decide the proper balance between newsworthiness and encyclopedic content.</p>
<p>There are a few video channels that people are hosting, but none of them are very interesting. Instead, watch Weekend Update science editor John Belushi reporting on the impending <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/iss/skylab.deorbit.html">fall of Skylab</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">Facebook changes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Facebook is changing, again; that&#39;s not really news, since it seems to change all the time. Some people will like it, some people will hate it, and for the most part people will get used to it since they always seem to.</p>
<p>I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. It&#39;s remarkable that even stuff from four years ago was relatively easy to dig up; to do the same task on Twitter is impossible at the moment, and blog archive systems could learn a thing or two as well.</p>
<p>I&#39;m never going to end up with all of my digital history tucked away neatly inside the Facebook world; for better or for worse, it&#39;s too messy to find and not worthwhile to even think how to relive enough of the past. Still, there&#39;s something appealing now to a system that really has a sense of time, and where things that are old don&#39;t disappear.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote this for a now defunct mailing list on the day after 9/11. It seems reasonable to post it now, to remember what happened in a way that doesn&#39;t focus on the event, but rather how much things have changed since then.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Saul and I went swimming today at the Y. The big pool was full of kids&#0160;taking lessons, and the little pool had 3 parents and their kids splashing&#0160;and kicking and in Saul&#39;s case swallowing a bit of water. The radio was&#0160;on rather loud in the lifeguard&#39;s office, with what sounded like NPR news&#0160;going. Earlier in the day we went to farmer&#39;s market - it&#39;s nearing the&#0160;end of the peach season, but there are peppers in abundance, and plenty of&#0160;tomatoes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely starting to be fall here, with leaves turning red on at&#0160;least one tree on my regular path downtown. [...]<br /><br />A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.<br /><br />By 11 am there were no copies of the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, or&#0160;even USA Today to be had from vending machines or from Borders.<br /><br />My immediate family is checking in, and everyone is accounted for.&#0160;I have three cousins in New York City, and my parents are visiting&#0160;my brother and sister-in-law in DC. There are stories to tell but<br />not now, I am not ready for that quite yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5R0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1304%2C767102" target="_self">Big rally on the Diag last night, something like 15,000 people were there</a>,&#0160;the&#0160;coverage from the student newspaper. We were putting Saul to bed at the&#0160;time.<br /><br />I spent far too much of Tuesday glued to the net, the radio, and to my&#0160;phone, and then late at night I finally hauled up our TV from the basement&#0160;and looked at some pictures.<br /><br />It&#39;s late now, and I don&#39;t really have a lot more to say. I would like to&#0160;hear what you are doing. I know that not everything is all right, but&#0160;even a few words about what your day is like, the sights and sounds around&#0160;you, would be nice to hear.<br /><br />For those of you who lost friends and loved ones yesterday, my&#0160;thoughts are with you.<br /><br /></p>

      <p><p>The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee have made their way slowly from the Gulf of Mexico to the northeastern United States, bringing a storm with a slow-moving heavy rain. There is widespread flooding in the Susquehanna River basin and flash floods across the area. The Weather Underground&#39;s <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1921" target="_self">Jeff Masters has commentary on the storm</a> from the morning of September 8, 2011, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An extreme rainfall event unprecedented in recorded history has hit the&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBGM/2011/09/07/DailyHistory.html" target="_blank">Binghamton, New York</a>&#0160;area, where 7.49&quot; fell yesterday. This is the second year in a row Binghamton has recorded a 1-in-100 year rain event; their previous all-time record was set last September, when 4.68&quot; fell on Sep 30 - Oct. 1, 2010. Records go back to 1890 in the city. The skies have now cleared in Binghamton, with this morning&#39;s rain bringing the city&#39;s total rainfall for the 40-hour event to 9.02&quot;. However, another large region of rain lies just to the south in Pennsylvania, and all of the rivers in the surrounding region are in major or record flood. The Susquehanna River at Binghamton is at 25&#39;, its highest level since records began in 1847, and is expected to overtop the flood walls protecting the city this afternoon. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, Swatara Creek is 18&#39; over flood stage, and more than 8&#39; above its record flood crest. Widespread flash flooding is occurring across the entire area, and over 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.</p>

      <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://crisislanding.appspot.com/" target="_self">2011 hurricane season crisis map from Google</a>&#0160;has the first large scale version of a multi-utility outage map. It renders thematic maps from 5 east coast utilities (ConEdison, Pepco, Progress Energy, Delmarva and Atlantic City) on a single map, pulled from a KML (GeoRSS) file that notes the relative severity of the storms in each area. Map below shows a day with no severe outages, all blue; I&#39;ll need to compare with a post-storm power outage.</p>

<h3>DETROIT, Sept. 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy has introduced a new interactive iPhone application (app) for customers to access a variety of up-to-the-minute information, including real-time outage information from their mobile devices.</h3>
<p>The DTE Energy Outage Center app is available from the Apple iTunes App store or Apple.com free of charge.</p>
<p>Located at&#0160;<a href="http://dteenergy.com/" target="_blank">dteenergy.com</a>, the Outage Center is a central area online where consumers interested in getting the latest information about power outages, get tips on what to do during a storm or other frequently asked questions. DTE Energy is one of the first utilities in the country to allow customers to report power outages via a downloadable native mobile smartphone application. &#0160;</p>
<p>Using the app, DTE Energy customers can report power outages, view the status of a reported problem and explore a map illustrating the number of outages reported throughout the area.</p>
<p>DTE Energy has added this mobile capability to our existing suite of outage-related offerings to bring useful information to customers in the way they want or in an outage situation, where they are able to see it.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a variety of tools for our customers already available on the DTE Energy website and we want to extend those tools in new and engaging ways,&quot; said Patrick Duffy, Customer Service Manager with DTE Energy. With the summer storm season upon us, extending the outage reporting tools to the iPhone was a great place for us to start.&quot;</p>
<p>Additional mobile communications offerings, such as the ability to check account balances and submit mobile payments are currently in development. DTE Energy is also working on an application that supports Android devices.</p>
<p>DTE Energy expects the iPhone app to give users a convenient method to report problems and retrieve updates. The company worked with Southfield-based RIIS to develop and test the application, which allows customers to access information on outages in their neighborhood or throughout Michigan.</p>
<p>The creation of an iPhone app broadens the reach of DTE Energy&#39;s Outage Center tools to a wider audience.</p>
<p>DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Its operating units include Detroit Edison, an electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan, MichCon, a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan and other non-utility, energy businesses focused on gas storage and pipelines, unconventional gas production, power and industrial projects, and energy trading.

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at201109.html" target="_self">Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene</a> page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-pi"><img alt="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov" target="_self">National Hurricane Center&#39;</a>s Irene archive has a fascinating <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/graphics/al09/loop_5W.shtml" target="_self">loop of 5 day Hurricane Irene forecasts</a>, showing the evolving best forecast track for the storm. It&#39;s a clear look not only at where the storm is going but also where projections have changed, in this case the projections that (on Tuesday) have landfall in North Carolina instead of Florida.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/" target="_self">Tropical Cyclone Guidance Project at NCAR</a>&#0160;has an even more detailed set of <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/realtime/plots/northatlantic/2011/al092011/" target="_self">data for Hurricane Irene</a>, including an archive of sets of model predictions for the storm.</p>
<p>After the storm, the set of models will be compared to the actual path to verify model accuracy. This National Weather Service <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/index.shtml" target="_self">National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification</a>&#0160;report charts forecast accuracy over time, noting how improved modeling and added computing power has made storm forecasting more accurate over time. How much better? Consider that the average 24 hour forecast error was 100 miles in 1990, but only 50 miles in 2010; also, that the models currently in use give as good a 5 day forecast (about 225 miles off) as the 2 day forecast was in 1988.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-17-what-to-write/">What to write</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next.</p>
<p>Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that. A second is the perennially interesting article which routinely gets seasonal traffic when the world looks for that bit of information that they look for every year.</p>
<p>A third type of post, of course, is this one, which gets no appreciable readership in the short run or in the long run; that&#39;s mostly typical.</p>
<p>Writing the perennially interesting piece is hard, because you need to care about something deeply enough to capture a piece of what you and the world know about it that&#39;s of enduring interest and that&#39;s enough better than the rest of the net that people will find it. Once you do track this down, your search logs will lead you to variations and refinements that make the post better. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage maps</a> post has this quality.</p>
<p>The post with a burst of intense newsworthiness is generally not newsworthy beyond two or three days. If you are fortunate, you have collected something that is otherwise interesting. I have a habit of collecting incident and situation maps for emerging events; this recent <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/august-2011-london-riot-maps.html" target="_self">London riot map</a> post is of that type.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to think that I don&#39;t need to have an audience (beyond myself) for this writing, but that said, it&#39;s always good to see that at least someone reads something that you write. (Otherwise, you&#39;d be better off putting in on paper and then recycling it immediately.) When I&#39;ve tried to use a blog as mostly a collection point, it has helped to divide out a separate blog for that purpose. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/telegraph" target="_self">telegraphy blog</a> admits the notion that on any given day zero or one person might read it, but it has been assembled as a collection, not a narrative. For some other ongoing efforts, a wiki might be more appropriate, e.g. for <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor history</a>, <a href="http://camera-wiki.org" target="_self">cameras</a>, or encyclopedic knowledge about <a href="http://t.tatianastomatobase.com:88/wiki/Main_Page" target="_self">tomatoes</a>. &#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A trip to the Goodwill store in Marquete, MI prompted an examination of their media collection. I ignored the piles of CDs, skipped the shelf of LPs, and went to the bin that had cassettes and 8-tracks. For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;. On the video shelves, there were plenty of 1990s vintage VHS tapes and a whole shelf of VHS players stacked up.</p>
<p>This is the same store that had a 1973 Reader&#39;s Digest Almanac on the shelf, reporting earnestly on the issues of the day (Nixon, food prices).</p>
<p>The 8-track discovery led me to do some searching, and I found a whole collection of <a href="http://www.fwweekly.com/index.php?option=com_wordpress&amp;tag=the-dead-media&amp;Itemid=12" target="_self">stories in the Fort Worth Weekly about The Dead Media</a>, an 8-track record label with a handful of new releases. &#0160;See <a href="http://deadmediatapes.com/" target="_self">DeadMediaTapes.com</a>&#0160;for the work of&#0160;Fort Worth R&amp;B singer-songwriter&#0160;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/browningham" target="_blank">Nathan Brown</a>.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how long these 8-tracks have been rattling around, and what path they took to get to this particular Goodwill. &#0160;They had the dusty patina of unloved old media, still recognizably worth something, but not yet at a home that would appreciate them. &#0160; They aren&#39;t hip, or trendy, or ironic; they&#39;re just old, at least in this place.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acturban.org/biennial/doc_planners/treanor_internet_hyperliberalism.htm" target="_self">The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism</a>&#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. On the contrary: never before in history, have so many separate networks been technically possible. Linking all networks together is a conscious choice by some people, a choice then imposed on others. The logic is identical to that of colonial governments, which forced peasants into the agricultural market, by imposing cash taxes. (To pay the tax, the peasants had to sell cash crops such as sugar). This logic says in effect: &#39;no one is free to stay outside the free market&#39;. Today, not just governments, but business, social movements, intellectuals and artists, all want to impose the Net. This broad movement is obviously more than profit-seeking (and a non-profit Net would also be wrong). It is an ideological movement seeking ideological imposition. That imposition itself, the universalism, the expansionism, their involuntary nature, the basic unfreedom to exit - that is what makes liberal structures wrong. That applies to the free market, and it applies inherently to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=2299" target="_self">Pandora&#39;s Vox Redux</a> (humdog, 1994)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many times in cyberspace, i felt it necessary to say that i was human. once, i was told that i existed primarily as a voice in somebody’s head. lots of times, i need to see handwriting on paper or a photograph or a phone conversation to confirm the humanity of the voice, but that is the way that i am. i resist being boxed and inventoried and i guess i take william gibson seriously when he writes about machine intelligence and constructs. i do not like it. i suspect that my words have been extracted and that when this essay shows up, they will be extracted some more. when i left cyberspace, i left early one morning and forgot to take out the trash. two friends called me on the phone afterwards and said, hummie your directory is still there. and i said OH. and they knew and i knew, that it was possible that people had been entertaining themselves with the contents of my directories. the amusement never ends, as peter gabriel wrote. maybe sometime i will rant again if something interesting comes up. in the meantime, give my love to the FBI.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who’d prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where–in the holy names of Education and Progress–important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.</p>

<p>The mid-1990s were a good time to be high-mindedly anti-network.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly declares: &quot;The validity of the public debt of the&#0160;<strong>United&#0160;</strong><strong>States</strong>, authorized by law, . . . shall not be questioned.&quot; While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the Government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation. We regard it as confirmatory of a fundamental principle, which applies as well to the government bonds in question, and to others duly authorized by the Congress, as to those issued before the Amendment was adopted. Nor can we perceive any reason for not considering the expression &quot;the&#0160;<em>validity</em>&#0160;of the public debt&quot; as embracing whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 18, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --</p>
<p>Borders Group reported today that, in accordance with the terms of its financing agreement, the Company will submit to the Court for approval the previously-announced proposal from&#0160;Hilco and Gordon Brothers&#0160;to purchase the store assets of the business and administer the liquidation process. Borders said that, in the absence of a formal proposal from a going concern bidder, it did not require an auction prior to presenting the proposal to the Court at a scheduled hearing on&#0160;Thursday, July 21, 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the best efforts of all parties, we are saddened by this development,&quot; said Borders Group President&#0160;Mike Edwards. &quot;We were all working hard towards a different outcome, but the headwinds we have been facing for quite some time, including the rapidly changing book industry, eReader revolution, and turbulent economy, have brought us to where we are now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For decades, Borders stores have been destinations within our communities, places where people have sought knowledge, entertainment, and enlightenment and connected with others who share their passion. Everyone at Borders has helped millions of people discover new books, music, and movies, and we all take pride in the role Borders has played in our customers&#39; lives,&quot; Edwards continued, &quot;I extend a heartfelt thanks to all of our dedicated employees and our loyal customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Borders currently operates 399 stores and employs approximately 10,700 employees. Subject to the Court&#39;s approval, under the proposal, liquidation is expected to commence for some stores and facilities as soon as&#0160;Friday, July 22, with a phased rollout of the program which is expected to conclude by the end of September. Borders intends to liquidate under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, as a result, Borders expects to be able to pay vendors in the ordinary course for all expenses incurred during the bankruptcy cases.</p>
