        <p>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable. Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don't always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it's possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-09-personal-public-and-team-wikis/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Ann Arbor plow truck public tracking page shows where the snow plows are out and about in Ann Arbor. This view shows 4 of the 5 trucks that were out on Monday evening, January 2, 2012. Plow routes are color coded, and plow trucks are numbered. One tip: if you are using Chrome, turn on and off the &quot;label&quot; field to get the trucks to show. The system is build by Radio Satellite Integrators, and uses ESRI map technology. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-02-ann-arbor-plow-trucks-public-tracking/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The San Francisco Chronicle has a story about how important it is to keep an accurate set of maps:&#0160;Missing maps mean PG&amp;E lines weren&#39;t inspected. The story is from December 31, 2011: Pacific Gas and Electric Co. failed to check nearly 14 miles of gas distribution pipelines for leaks for up to two decades when it lost track of 16 maps needed to guide mandated safety inspections of its system in eastern Contra Costa County, company officials acknowledged to state regulators Friday. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-31-missing-maps-lead-to-gas-leaks-in-pge-network/">&raquo;</a></p>
