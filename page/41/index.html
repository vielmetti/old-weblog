<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In our new building, paint is going onto the walls. The reading nooks looking out onto the courtyard are warm with color. The sun comes in through the huge windows and skylights, and every way you look there are views to the trees outside. The flexible learning spaces - the common areas, breakout spaces, front porches for the classrooms, the open library space - are everything I hoped they would be. The music and drama studio, the science lab, the art room, the classrooms; they are all spacious, bright, gorgeous places. Soon they will be alive with children and the hum of projects and great ideas.&#0160;<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: my son goes to Summers-Knoll School, and he&#39;s looking forward to having more kids in his age range, so I&#39;m particularly eager to recruit 7th and 8th graders.</p>

<p>DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.</p>
<p>Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Busch&#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky.</p>
<p>Second Street was worst hit in the old part of Dexter village. Every second house on the downhill side of Second had a blue tarp on part of a roof, but the uphill side had no roof damage. Several businesses on Second were damaged, including a laudromat that was completely demolished.</p>
<p>The tornado crossed the Norfolk Southern tracks right by the Dexter Mill. Several homes on Huron Street had blue tarps as well. The Dexter cider mill looked OK, but it was closed for the season. Damage at the Dexter Mill included large sheets of metal that had been twisted around like crumpled paper.</p>
<p>Downtown was completely normal with no visible damage. The Dexter Bakery smelled like a bakery that my great aunt might have taken me to 30 years ago. The Dairy Queen was serving up standard issue cones, with a long line in the unseasonably warm March summer.</p>
<p>Many trucks went past as I enjoyed my cone with trailers or truckbeds full of full-grown trees, cut into short logs or big chunks. Signs were up everywhere for home repair and remodeling, and a number of insurance companies had trucks or vans parked to take claims.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable storm, in part because of the damage, and in part because there was no loss of life. It could have been much, much worse. I am sure that residents of Dexter will be glad for construction to rebuild homes and put people&#39;s lives back towards normal.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-02-18-ann-arbor-municipal-irritant/">City of Ann Arbor turns down request for meeting minutes, again</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff.</p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups. For instance:</p>
<p>The Local Development Finance Authority is the city body that allocates economic development funds from tax capture to development organizations, primarily Ann Arbor SPARK. As of the latest board packet, there is no treasurer to this organization, as none of the existing board members were willing to serve in that role. There is one open position on that board as of this writing.</p>
<p>The Sign Board of Appeals meets only when citizens or businesses have an appeal to decisions made under the city&#39;s Sign Ordinance. This body only has 4 members seated, with 3 vacancies. As a result, that board did not elect officers and did not approve the most recent minutes of a previous meeting. The Sign Ordinance is said to be up for review, according to the draft minutes that I looked at, but the Sign Board had not seen that draft.</p>
<p>The Zoning Board of Appeals meetings to hear appeals to the city&#39;s zoning laws. Here was the most unusual result that I had from a series of Freedom of Information Act requests: the draft minutes of the last meeting, in December, were not available when I asked for them, and the city turned down a FOIA request for those minutes. Under the Michigan Open Meetings Act, draft minutes are to be made available within 8 days of a public meeting being held. I appealed that decision - and it&#39;s appalling that I should have to go through the FOIA appeals process just to read meeting minutes - and was given the minutes the day after my appeal. This <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2011/12/07/zba-turns-down-city-place-appeal/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle civic news ticker</a> has the results of that meeting, which was controversial and resulted in the rejection of neighborhood appeals to the City Place development decision.</p>
<p>Is it unusual for a public body to turn down requests for meeting minutes? It&#39;s happened to me before, when I had to go through <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/on-asking-for-something-you-know-doesnt-exist/" target="_self">a protacted series of requests to get minutes from the Historic District Commission.</a>&#0160;The first time you do this, it&#39;s an exciting process of delving into the fine points of carefully worded language to appeal a city decision. The second time, it&#39;s just tedious and frustrating to have to go all the way to the city administrator just to get minutes to read. I suppose I&#39;ll keep earning my title of &quot;municipal irritant&quot; one way or another, even without attending the meetings.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Penn State football coach Joe Paterno died January 22, 2012, of complications from lung cancer treatment. He was 85. Hours before, his death was prematurely announced by multiple news services, prompting retractions and apologies from those organizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier Saturday night, CBSSports.com published an unsubstantiated report that former Penn State coach Joe Paterno had died. That mistake was the result of a failure to verify the original report. CBSSports.com holds itself to high journalistic standards, and in this circumstance tonight, we fell well short of those expectations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The twitter account that first reported former Penn State coach Joe Paterno died just posted an update linking to a letter of resignation from its managing editor, Devon Edwards.</p>
<p>Once the normally reputable national CBS Sports outlet picked up the student news source’s story, the now-retracted report of Paterno’s death went national.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable.</p>

<p>Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don't always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it's possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care. Arborwiki fits the bill for this for me; I've made a lot<br />
of edits there, but the most popular pages have the most diverse edit base.</p>

<p>Team wikis appear in this decade to be embedded in some other bigger system that needs a shared editable place but that also has some other explicitly transactional work going on. Wiki nature does not include the verbs "assign", "delegate", "report on", or even really "decide", and if you are doing any kind of process work you often land on something beyond a<br />
simple "edit this page". <br />

      </h3>
      <p>A proposal to reform the calendar system, circa 1935, would have simplified the seasons by making every single year have the same calendar, every single quarter have 91 days and 13 Sundays, and every January 1 always fall on a Sunday. Leap years are accomodated with a mid-year extra Saturday, and the end of the year is celebrated as Year End Day, also as an extra Saturday.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the <a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org" target="_self">World Calendar Association</a> is still going strong. A word from their web site on the origin of this proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ASSETS/AchelisPronunciation.swf" target="_blank"><strong>Elisabeth Achelis</strong></a>&#0160;spread the New York Times out on her desk, momentarily blanketing the plaque dear to her that bore this quote of&#0160;unknown Persian origin. On that Sunday,&#0160;<strong>September 8, 1929</strong>&#0160;(a date&#0160;she never forgot and one she revisited fondly in her 1961 autobiography,<em>&#0160;<strong>Be Not Silent</strong></em>), Elisabeth found a&#0160;<a href="http://www.theworldcalendar.org/8September1929-NYT.htm" target="_blank"><strong>letter to the editor of the New York Times</strong></a>&#0160;by Lewis E. Ashbaugh of Denver, Colorado. In a brief, almost casual tone, Ashbaugh suggested that the then-unofficial National Committee on Calendar Simplification should consider the adoption of a twelve-month, equal-quarter calendar (perhaps suggested as early as 1745 and published by Abbe´ Mastrofini in 1834) over that of the thirteen-month one that was rapidly gaining popular favor. Elisabeth saw much in this simply revised calendar plan, and instantaneously knew that her five-year search for something to help the world in which she lived had come to an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose that calendar reform is no less exotic than speling reform, and that a 12 month rearranged calendar is less exotic than a 13 month calendar where every month has a Friday the 13th.</p>

<p>2. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/01/australia-flood-map-january-10-2011.html">Australia flood maps for January, 2011.</a> Brisbane got socked with floods in January, and the maps capture the weather at the time plus links of the day and some astounding flood footage.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/2011-vermont-flood-maps-irene.html">Vermont flood maps for Hurricane Irene.</a> When Irene hit Vermont, roads were washed out, travel was disrupted, and towns were cut off from the world. A number of organizations put together rapid response flooding maps, and some of these are saved here.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/tsunami-maps-for-march-2011-honshu-earthquake.html">Tsunami maps</a> and maps of Fukushima after the nuclear disaster in Japan. It was easy to be glued to the net for news in March about the Honshu earthquake and its impact on Japan; this post was put together the day of the quake as news slowly emerged about tsunami risks.</p>

<p>5. <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/central-texas-fires.html">Central Texas fire maps.</a> Put together for friends and family near Austin, Texas, this collection of maps includes the Weather Underground fire layer map, one of the best near real time fire watching tools out there, as seen for the Bastrop County, Texas fires in September.</p>

<p>What do I conclude about this? </p>

<p>If all I wanted to do was maximize the number of page views that I got, I would be consistently pulling together maps about every modern day meteorological disaster. Fire, flood, power outage, tsunami, hurricane, snowstorm, have at it - every single one of them has a map to go with the story, and every time there's a story someone looks for the map to go with it.</p>

<p>Most news reporting doesn't pull in anywhere near the richness and detail that a good set of map searches will do, and most map sites that display real time data don't save every possible newsworthy map event. Combine these two, and you can be certain that the maps you collect will tell a story that's otherwise hard to illustrate.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>If I read Facebook for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;like&quot; things, and generally let people know that I exist.</p>
<p>If I read Twitter for too long, I want to post short quips, &quot;favorite&quot; things, and generally let people know that they exist.</p>
<p>When I sit in front of Typepad ready to type, it&#39;s not always for the short post, and often it&#39;s not even for an audience. My working assumption is that unless I&#39;m writing about something that the world cares about, only a handful of people will see it. The other working assumption is that I really don&#39;t know before I write it how it will be received, so it better be good enough for me to want to refer to again just for myself.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve referred to Vacuum as an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s also a place to capture &quot;interior stories&quot;, internal monologue that makes sense about how you do things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.getstoried.com/2010/05/19/interview-christina-baldwin/" target="_self">(Christina) Baldwin</a> says that if people aren’t attached to their interior stories, they get <span style="background-color: #80ffff;">addicted to feedback</span>. Although I would have considered myself attached to my interior story, I also recognize a social-media feedback addiction in myself. I’m always curious about what kinds of comments that my, for example, Facebook status updates, have generated. (from <a href="http://astoriedcareer.com/2010/06/those-unattached-to-their-inte.html" target="_self">A Storied Career</a>, &#0160;a blog by&#0160;Kathy Hansen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you write to inform yourself, and the goal isn&#39;t to create or please your followers, or to get new ones, or to up your page view count or close a new lead. It&#39;s just to write, and to capture what&#39;s going by in your head to the level that you can recreate it later.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog has always been for me an exercise in locating other people&#39;s words to help illustrate my point. That gives it some measure of similarity to a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/secret/2010/12/its-worth-writing-it-down-even-if-you-dont-know-who-the-audience-is-yet.html" target="_self">commonplace book</a>, a traditional way to copy out bits of prose that you wish to make your own into a kind of clippings book or scrapbook of words.</p>
<p>I&#39;m content, really, to be &quot;addicted to feedback&quot;, but I reserve the right to look for the right kind of feedback to tune into. The feedback of blogging is the long, low rumble of old notebooks that have just the right relevant bits to tune into, and not just the shrill, high ping of social media contacts.</p>

(A geologist) was keen to use the photos in a paper he was writing and said (and I more-or-less quote) “I’ve been to substantial earthquakes all over the world for the past 30 years and I haven’t seen liquefaction anywhere near as bad as it is in Christchurch.

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://bjfogg.com" target="_self">BJ Fogg</a> is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce <a href="http://bit.ly/3tinyhabits" target="_self">three tiny habits</a> that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a perfect example of a tiny habit, since cleaning the kitchen can take a while.</p>
<p>The practice of tiny habits is radically different from the typical New Year&#39;s Resolution which is grandiose, sweeping, and hard to fulfill. &quot;Be a better person&quot; is really different from &quot;brush your teeth after you floss them&quot; or &quot;go to bed after the computer goes to sleep&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out the tiny habit that will get me writing regularly. Ideally, in some perfect world, I&#39;d write more regularly. I don&#39;t want a &quot;write a page every day&quot; goal, because that&#39;s largely unmanagable - when would I do it? But perhaps I can set myself a tiny goal, that&#39;s more like &quot;when I sit down at the computer after the kitchen is clean, open it up to my blog and start writing until I stop.&quot;</p>
<p>At the very least, that will ensure that the kitchen will be clean before bedtime.</p>
