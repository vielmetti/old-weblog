<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-24-unpolished-open-notebook/">Unpolished writing in the open notebook</a>
      </h3>
      <p><em>Steve Crocker, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3" target="_self">Internet Request for Comments 3</a>, from 1969: &quot;There is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.&quot;</em></p>
<p>From time to time, someone reads Vacuum and comments that the writing looks unpolished and incomplete. Why would you publish this kind of work, which obviously isn&#39;t up to the standards that would let you sell it to someone for use in print? Why wouldn&#39;t you hide it in your notebooks?</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this weblog as a notebook, and publishing my notes for myself instead of always as a tightly edited, polished, finished work. By exposing this part of a process I hope to be prepared to find some way to make myself understood, even if I don&#39;t completely understand myself immediately as I write through an issue or question. Thoughts go in, get refined as far as they need to be to make them coherent, and then go onto the net and into the world so that there&#39;s room for the next piece to emerge.</p>
<p>The open notebook is going to be messy, but it also means that I have some hope of finding my own half-finished work and revisiting it years later; when I don&#39;t do that, there&#39;s always something lost. Writing this way lets me tune into ideas, spin them around for a bit until I have a clearer focus, and move on. In most cases, I&#39;m not ready to make things shiny and neat, and I&#39;m content to explore facets of an unpolished gem over a series of years.</p>
<p><em>Previously, because I put it out there in first draft format so that I could find it again: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/first-version-coherent.html" target="_self">make the first version coherent</a> (from 2011); &#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/creativity-vs-p.html" target="_self">creativity vs productivity</a>&#0160;(from 2008); on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/04/shitty_first_dr.html" target="_self">shitty first drafts</a> (from 2007); <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2004/05/my_quadrille_no.html" target="_self">wishing that my weblog looked more like my quadrille notebooks</a> (from 2004).</em></p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-summer-2011-discardia-notes/">Summer 2011 discardia notes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at <a href="http://www.discardia.com" target="_self">discardia.com</a>. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.</p>
<p>For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. Before you can do a rebuild of a model that you already have, you need to find all of the impossibly tiny scattered pieces that make it up. A multipart storage box container is a great way to occupy a small boy&#39;s hour cleaning and sorting, because only when you have all of the yellow pieces together do you find the tiny Lego-sized firefighters accessories. Once you get down to the level that you can find the tiny black fireman&#39;s axe, the small child is content to build with it rather than agitate to buy more.</p>
<p>Books are my bane of accumulation existence, to the point where deciding what to do with them takes more energy than actually reading them. We have used Paperback Swap to maintain a steady state of inventory and still get new reading materials, and Books By Chance to dispose of surplus. Fortunately, the Lego situation (q.v.) is under control enough that I have reclaimed one bookshelf, which is being carefully curated as best I can to contain the collection that I would keep if it were my only shelf of books. Every decision to add to it means there&#39;s a corresponding decision to remove a book, and that keeps the shelf from accumulating dust and ennui.</p>
<p>The element of my life that absorbs more time than it should is the Internet, especially the Internet of flitting around from site to site trying to decide that someone has written something new worth writing. My self control is weak for shiny new things, but what I have discovered is that I can replace self control with ritual sometimes, and a ritual of writing on a specific topic for a specific person rather than reading aimlessly repays the time. I don&#39;t know yet how to cure a ritual addiction to being online, though Paul Jones&#39;s &quot;no email&quot; project points to one way to discard a portion of the online existence while staying connected.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Dinah Sanders for the &quot;decide and do&quot; theme for this season&#39;s <a href="http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/">Discardia</a>. John Weise and Stephanie Bentley run <a href="http://www.booksbychance.com/">Books By Chance</a>, a consignment used bookstore which helps deal with my book surplus.

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">Potholes and performance warranties for road construction</a>
      </h3>
      <p>After a rough winter, potholes are <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">ubiquitous</span> on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.</p>
<p>The technology to <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">repair</span> a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. In comparison, preventing a pothole from appearing in the first place means spending a lot more capital on road construction to build a more sturdy roadbed capable of handling heavier loads and less likely to buckle or crumble with frost.</p>
<p>At an extreme, you get the original World War Two era Davison Freeway in Detroit, which was <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">over-engineered</span> so that no highway problems would get in the way of the speedy shipment of materials for the war effort. That roadbed lasted from 1942 to 1997 - beat up and dangerous at the end, but still working 55 years before it was rebuilt.</p>
<p>To spend less on pothole repair, spend more on road construction? Perhaps, though there is no guarantee that new pavement will withstand daily traffic. A possible solution is to <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">give a contract which specifies that the road builder is also the road maintainer</span>, and that the cost of a pothole repair comes out of whatever profits were made by the building of the road. At least in theory, it would allow someone to make a reasonable tradeoff between current capital costs and future operations costs of maintaining a road; in practice, it probably would mean <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">low-ball bidding</span> by bidders who would build insubstantial roads and then under-deliver on the promise of keeping them maintained.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.qxork.com" target="_self">Fred Posner</a> for the prompt to write about this, and to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peggypage" target="_self">Peggy Page</a>&#0160;for post-publication editorial feedback. Previously on potholes: the Ann Arbor&#0160;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/03/a2csr.html" target="_self">Citizen Request System</a>. <a href="http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Casestudy/Davison.htm" target="_self">Archival photos of the Davison Freeway</a> under construction and at its first opening show the impact that freeway building has on a neighborhood. A <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100303-25651.html" target="_self">2010 story</a> describes potholes for sale in eastern Germany, with the purchaser getting a sponsorship message on the repair; a <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/kfc-and-peta-vie-to-fix-potholes/" target="_self">similar stunt in 2009</a> featured road repair by KFC.&#0160;&#0160;The city has a dedicated phone number to report potholes: call 734-99-HOLES.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em>Addendum: After publishing a first draft of this piece, I found this <a href="www.house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/warrant.pdf" target="_self">2001 Michigan House Fiscal Agency report on performance warranties for road construction</a>, which goes into some more of the purchasing process for major roadwork to understand how a road builder might manage a contract that required them to make whole a road that had not lived up to promises. It notes that a &quot;warranty bond&quot; would be required to ensure that if the road builder went out of business that the road would still be maintained - a sizable cost that would limit the number of bidders. A report from a <a href="http://www.nmshtd.state.nm.us/main.asp?secid=11464" target="_self">performance-based warranty for a rebuild of US 550 in New Mexico</a>&#0160;describes a successful project for a difficult road; the warranty costs are substantial, amounting to 20% of the total bid.&#0160;</em></p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-prediction-markets/">Prediction markets are too easy to game, so let&#39;s play games instead</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Prediction markets provide a nice, idealized way to use market mechanisms to predict the future. They are a slightly idealized version of an office betting pool and allow small scale bets (real or virtual) on future events. Unlike a real futures market, where you can get guarantees of future performance on things like delivery of gasoline or frozen orange juice, there&#39;s no way that betting on some prospective GOP hopeful will lift your candidate to office.</p>
<p>Market manipulation is the bane of most prediction markets. Consider Intrade, a prediction market in which GOP hopefuls are listed. The media will report that a newcomer is trading well, but won&#39;t necessarily note that the frontrunner&#39;s place is based on less than $500 worth of daily trades. If someone were to want to bump their favorite over the top for at least a little while it would only take pocket money from a proper hidden campaign pocket to game the system in your favor.</p>
<p>Gaming the system is a problem in systems that pretend to be markets, and where some ideal form of market is lionized as a way to gain enlightenment from the invisible hand of Adam Smith. Turning the system into a game to be one sullies the economist&#39;s ideals of a rational allocation of resources based on infinite economic rigor.</p>
<p>Why fight people&#39;s tendencies to want to subvert the intent of the system builder? The new hot trend in online environments is gamification, where gaming the system becomes the whole goal of the system. Unlike markets, which try to come to truth with some single-valued score of value, games have the opportunity to bring the world into a lovely multi-valued focus, with different people winning each at their own version of the game. The introduction of badges, short term competitions, lots of ways to score points and other fun side games overwhelms the narrow trading interests in market-based predicitons.&#0160;</p>
<p>The future of prediction markets lives inside complex predictive games. The game design has to take into account not only the rapid conclusions that you can draw when you have an efficient market for opinions, but also the continuous efforts you have to keep up to maintain people&#39;s attention on a topic for any length of time. The good games reward active participation; the challenge becomes how to draw conclusions from the work of engaged gamers working inside your system.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://xca2.com/" target="_self">Brian Kerr</a> for the idea. Games are on my mind because of the work of the Ann Arbor District Library and Eli Neiburger to <a href="http://play.aadl.org" target="_self">build games into the summer reading program</a> at the library. I tried to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2007/02/predicting_hold.html" target="_self">predict library use</a>&#0160;with a prediction market in 2007, and <a href="http://home.inklingmarkets.com/markets/17016" target="_self">attendance at lunch</a>&#0160;in 2009, using Inkling Markets.

<p>Updated throughout at 9:00pm Eastern Time, June 22, 2011</p>
<p><strong>How many people are affected by the flooding?</strong></p>
<p>12,000 people are in the evacuation zone anticipating an alert for immediate evacuation on June 22, 2011 (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/22/us-flooding-plains-idUSTRE75L43H20110622" target="_self">Reuters</a>). Evacuations started June 1. The population of Minot is about 40,000.</p>
<p>Among the organizations affected by the flood is the Minot Air Force Base, which has opened a 24x7 emergency center to assist military families (<a href="http://www.minot.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123260870" target="_self">MAFB</a>). About 1,000 military personnel with homes in Minot have been displaced by the flood (<a href="http://www.minotdailynews.com/page/content.detail/id/556042/National-Guard--Minot-AFB-members-in-the-flood-battle.html?nav=5010">Minot Daily News</a>).</p>
<p>Flood damages are estimated at more than $90 million, according to a Minnesota Public Radio report.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-21-link-languages/">Link languages for navigating through a landscape of words</a>
      </h3>
      <div>
<blockquote>“People writing in a wiki often put important concepts or terms on separate pages in order to refer to them. If the name of such a page is repeatedly used by many to point to an idea described or discussed on it, the page has become a part of the <span style="background-color: #bfbfff;">link language</span> of the respective wiki-community.”&#0160;–&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/RadomirDopieralski">RadomirDopieralski</a>&#0160;&amp;&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/MattisManzel">MattisManzel</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004">LinkLanguage2004</a></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.communitywiki.org/en/LinkLanguage2004"></a>If you do a lot of writing on one topic, there are recurrent themes and key words and phrases that repeat themselves. The more specialized the topic, the more likely it is that the reader coming in for the first time will want to unpack some of the&#0160;<span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">coded language</span>&#0160;that you are using and look for some background so that they can understand what precisely it is that you are trying to say. The coded language will include some special words that only you yourself understand, and you hope that by repetition in a variety of contexts that someone else will pick up eventually on what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>A test of your ability to participate in a specialized community is your ability to readily understand what is being said when those code words come up and appreciate some bundle of meanings and allusions that they are supposed to&#0160;trigger. &quot;Rosemary for remembrance&quot;, and when rosemary is mentioned in a song you are expected to bring that meaning with you. Close readers of Bible texts with their <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">careful concordances</span> share the same <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">sensitive ear </span>to all of the echoes of where a particular word or phrase is repeated for a specific effect that has been cultivated over the ages.&#0160;</p>
<p>The challenge in wiki is that the links are made explicit, and that they typically resolve to one particular concrete instance of one interpretation of an idea, as collectively edited within that wiki. If your link language is <span style="background-color: #ffdfbf;">perpetually inward focused</span>, you coerce the world you are building to look inward upon itself rather than providing some parallel outward-looking view.</p>
<p>If you back out of that system and consider broader possibilities, think of the problem as similar to constructing a <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">readable&#0160;</span><span style="background-color: #dcd1df;">command language</span>&#0160;in which invoking a particular phrase causes action to happen in the world. The Unix shell language is one particular instance of a command language, with its regular expressions as underpinnings for a system that expresses connections between processing elements as though there were data moving through plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>Command languages gain some value because some of the encoding is made explicit. The difference can be readily seen in systems where hyperlinks to corporate names behave differently than hyperlinks to concepts or ideas. A business newswire will generally encode the name of the ticker symbol for a stock into a <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">specific referencable entity</span>, so that you don&#39;t have to interpret or guess what is being mentioned on the wire. Similarly, a link to a person&#39;s name in a news article could readily reference a biographical page or trigger a search for that specific name over a set of contact databases.</p>
<p>An advantage of recognizing this as a command language and not just a syntax for easy linking is that you can avoid the naive assumption that everyone who reads the language interprets it the same way. The language describes links between two parts of an <span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">flexibly articulated wordscape</span>, but it&#39;s up to the reader to resolve that link into something concrete. The modern web software fails to live up to the promise of understanding just how many variant interpretations there might be of one specific phrase, trading ease of linking for richness in expression.</p>
<p>Alas, the most prominent of command-based link languages degenerates into something very simple: &quot;buy now&quot;. The corresponding linguistic improvement is almost always &quot;make the buy button bigger&quot;. The language of electronic commerce degenerates into deducing which <span style="color: #ffbfff;">three weird words</span> will make the reader click through a link, guaranteed.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.markdilley.com" target="_self">Mark Dilley</a> for the idea, imperfectly explored here. John Lawler&#39;s <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/routledge/unix.html" target="_self">Unix for Linguists</a>&#0160;gave inspiration, as did the great weird ideas of Pete Kaminski as we were sorting out wiki syntax at Socialtext. At some point along the way, there was a universal wish to avoid needing any syntax in order to make links among related items, but the details as ever are elusive.&#0160;</em></p>

<p>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&#39;s Day at <span style="background-color: #ff80bf;">Rowe&#39;s</span> in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends.</p>
<p>The boys are at the age where they are quick at berry picking and accurate enough not to pick bad berries. They are capable of picking more than they can eat. I&#39;m looking forward to more berrypicking with them!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-20-neurodiversity/">Neurodiversity and the advantages of autism-spectrum disorders in network building</a>
      </h3>
      <p><blockquote>
<p>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&#39;s, ALS, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">diversity</span> of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>A parallel set of diversity-seeking looks to build connections with people who have diverse ways of perceiving the world. The <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">neurotypical</span> view of the world is best balanced with views from people who don&#39;t have nervous systems and sensory systems that perceive the world or act on those perceptions in the same way.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #bfffdf;">Neurodiversity</span> is a word with some specific meaning within a community of people with autism-spectrum disorders, a community which I know only at the edges and can&#39;t count myself a core part of. In some ways I can only hope to approximate that perspective, e.g. in the occasional bits of <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">assisted synesthesia</span>&#0160;that I try to sneak into my writing. If you are living in a neurotypical world, the insight from someone with diverse sensory perception can trigger the <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">great weird ideas</span> that you find when worlds that were once foreign to each other gain a bridge that helps pull good thoughts from one side to the other. Or, perhaps, I&#39;m a&#0160;<span style="background-color: #e6ebd5;">neurodiverse</span> individual in this collection, and you are neurotypical by comparison; it&#39;s so hard to tell sometimes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor is on a steady path to install LED street lighting. Downtown&#39;s Main Street and the campus entrance along South State Street both have <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">distinctive</span> and highly visible LEDs to illuminate well-travelled corridors.</p>
<p>While it&#39;s clear the LED lights use less energy, it&#39;s not always obvious that they cost less to install and operate for the duration of their expected lifetime. The technology is moving fast enough that next year&#39;s model will top this year&#39;s for the foreseeable future. Early adopters <span style="background-color: #ffbfff;">pay</span> for research.</p>
<p>When electric street lighting first appeared to replace gas lighting, it was seen as a sign of <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">civic progress</span>. LED street lighting must be valued as a sign that we live in a progressive place that will invest something beyond the minimum in order to light the way to the future.</p>

FAA spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said that United had ordered a ground stop of its planes on its own that ended at 7:55 a.m. The problem began about 5:15 a.m., she said.</p>

<p>United had told the FAA that it was a computer issue that made the airline unable to check in people for flights and resulted in an inability to get final flight information to the cockpit, Cory said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only remember in my 10 years one other time&rdquo; that computer glitches have caused this much trouble with flights, Cory said.
</blockquote>
A second report shows a similar system-wide glitch in 2007, here <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9732049-7.html">reported by CNET</a>:
<blockquote>
A total of 24 domestic flights were canceled, and 268 domestic and international flights were delayed by an average of one and half hours, according to United spokeswoman Robin Urbanski Janikowski.
&ldquo;We do not know the cause of the outage, and it&rsquo;s something that we will investigate. The computer outage affected the systems that United uses to dispatch flights for departure,&rdquo; Janikowski said in an e-mailed statement.

      </h3>
      <p>The input box on Twitter is very small, the user interface works on a cell phone, and it all feels so much like you are having a small intimate conversation with a few confidants. Something horrible is said and you and perhaps the world realize that this thing is not just a harmless lark.&#0160;</p>
<p>Twitter is a global communications infrastructure, with short meaningful names that replace carrier-assigned numbers for text and picture messaging. It&#39;s only a few short hops and some integration with shiny hardware to make that global namespace be the key to a lot more communications and publishing.</p>
<p>By all means, display your plumage on Twitter. Your indiscretions make up for the rest of us who are content to describe where we are eating a sandwich. We read along, fascinated, taking notes carefully on what not to say.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/">System mapping</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage maps I have been collecting</a> started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. You are looking for breadth in your view, and something that constrains the search so that you don&#39;t spend too much time in one place before going on.</p>
<p>It helps to have some kind of rudimentary ranking algorithm when wrapping up your search, so that you can look for gaps into which another example will fit. The utility map effort looks like it&#39;s going to generate a simple checklist for each map, so that I can give each one a score on completeness (0 = no map, add 1 for county by county stats, add 1 for city by city stats, add 1 for zoom to the outage, add 1 for systemwide counts etc).</p>
<p>Put the things you collect into categories that have names, so that you can start working with abstractions instead of concrete instances. The list of categories becomes another place to generate a bounded set of additional elements.</p>
<p>Once you have all of these you can start to think about plausible things that might be in the system that you haven&#39;t found yet. My piece on &quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unknowledge-management.html" target="_self">unknowledge management</a>&quot; (the phrase is <a href="http://www.munnecke.com/papers/dragons.htm" target="_self">from Tom Munnecke</a>) where the task becomes looking for names for things that don&#39;t exist yet but that might plausibly exist given the system that you have described. This means that you end up with something peculiar to search for, and either it doesn&#39;t exist yet, it can&#39;t exist (and your models are off), or you find it.</p>
<p>So the iterative process looks like</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">describe a search space</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">collect examples</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">rank along common attributes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">categorize into abstractions</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">synthesize the undiscovered instances</p>
<p>and that seems to be as good a plan as any for survey of the field.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/clf/programs/eating/proj_foodsystem.html" target="_self">food system map of Baltimore</a>&#0160;looks like an instance of the structure of this work. In academia, the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=survey+article&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart" target="_self">survey article</a>&#0160;(Google Scholar) is structured in much the same way.</p>

      <p>I find myself wanting to call people once in a while, and I also find that I know people&#39;s twitter names pretty well.</p>
<p>What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &quot;dial by twitter name&quot; in the sense that there&#39;s no command line prompt that has a &quot;call&quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>% call @vielmetti</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I&#39;m at even a worse spot; I don&#39;t even have a &quot;call&quot; command to start from at the shell script prompt. However, Twitter is in a good spot to do this - it knows the cell phone number of a lot of its users.</p>
<p>Perhaps then this is too good of an idea - does following someone mean that you are expecting to get calls from them? Some measure of opt-in seems appropriate, lest that eggbot spammer direct dial you to sell you air duct cleaning.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The weekend is a low email diet, but somehow that&#39;s difficult to do without explaining myself a little bit. Here&#39;s some thoughts as to how I might do things the next time that I work through the world of weekend time, how I can get some more effective communications rather than just more frequent.</p>
<p><strong>Short asynchronous private message</strong>. A Twitter direct message works nicely for this, as does an SMS message. Email is better for short messages when you keep your subject and text short enough that the reader can see it all in their preview window.</p>
<p><strong>Short asynchronous public message.</strong>&#0160;Twitter and Facebook both do a credible job of public messaging, though it all depends on what you mean by public. Email to a mailing list is reasonably public, sometimes, though sometimes people believe that it&#39;s private and get surprised by email leaking. My favorite public format is the blog post, but I think that&#39;s a sign of age; so few people use weblogs the way that I do that I feel like I&#39;m from another planet.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Short synchronous private messages.</strong>&#0160;A rapid burst of SMS messages works neatly, and is how this usually works for me when doing last-minute schedule coordination by text message. Email is never synchronous, though it seems that way at times, and you don&#39;t have anything like guaranteed delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Short synchronous public message. </strong>If I had to do this I&#39;d say IRC, except I hate that system most of the time. A twitter hash tag is very similar to IRC. I&#39;m told that LiveJournal deals well with this use case, for situations where you want real-time tracking of comments across multiple forums.&#0160;I can&#39;t think of an email application where this fits.</p>
<p><strong>Long asynchronous private message. </strong>This is one of the things that electronic mail can do well, and that most other online messaging systems do worse. I see a way to handle the world to reduce these by taking the positive versions of these and sending them out on paper, e.g. as postcards. If you can get documents out of long messages and into some kind of version control system or wiki, you can avoid the path of version skew as everyone shovels weirdly-named drafts at each other.</p>
<p><strong>Long asynchronous public message</strong>. You&#39;re looking at it; my blog is where I need to be writing more when it&#39;s time to put something into the world that might have use in the indefinite future.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><em>&quot;Sisyphus had it easy.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be off email starting Friday night and continuing to Sunday night; the second weekend in a row of a &quot;no email&quot; weekend. It wasn&#39;t quite 100% offline the first weekend, since I&#39;m so addicted, but I made a point of not clicking on any messages in my inbox and not sending any mail.</p>
<p>Part of the plan for not doing email is making sure that at the end of the time you can recover gracefully and not feel overwhelmed. This meant dealing with an entire boatload of messages all at once, processing a weekend&#39;s worth of mail in a Sunday evening. That&#39;s hardly fun, but it beats the alternative of working the email treadmill all weekend long.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I managed to do was slow down the rate of messages into my inbox at least a little by identifying one mailing list that I really like that I just don&#39;t have the time to follow right now. It all by itself generates 20-40 messages a day, and even if those only take a few seconds to skip over, it&#39;s too much of a burden of diligence to stay on top of it.&#0160;</p>
<p>I also realized that I don&#39;t have secondary or tertiary communications paths to everyone who is in my inbox. I don&#39;t know everyone&#39;s phone number, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m Facebook friends with them, they might or might not use Twitter, and many times I don&#39;t have a postal address. I&#39;d love to be able to say that for everyone who mattered I had three ways to signal them, just in case there was some need to be persistent to get a message through.&#0160;</p>

      <p>From <a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/uplift_linguistic_shell/unknowledge_pattern_language" target="_self">The Unknowledge Pattern Language</a>, on Nooron:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&#39;t know about the elements, until we &quot;filled in the blanks.&quot; These &quot;named voids&quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery? The discovery of zero, a &quot;missing nothing,&quot; was one of the turning points in Western thought. Are there other missing nothings lurking about, waiting to be discovered? If so, how do we name these voids, and to what end? This is the stuff of unknowledge management.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving a name to something is a powerful act of creation. The ability to describe the unknown and nonexistent with words that are suggestive of its qualities creates a new universe of the plausible alternatives to the way that things are right now, and gives a way forward either to discover the absent or to rename existing concepts as though they were brand new.</p>
<p>My first hand experience in this world is in the world of wiki, where any name can be the target of commentary. Your wiki link to <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Price_of_a_cup_of_coffee" target="_self">Price of a cup of coffee</a>&#0160;is real, even if the page that answers that query is currently blank. At a later time you can bind the name to its commentary, and use the statistics you get from watching people explore the unknowledge of the world to decide which of it to bring to reality.</p>
<p>A counterpoint to this line of reasoning is the periodic need to unname things which have names, so that they can grow new names that are newly reflective of the current observation. We didn&#39;t know that we had land-line phones and terrestrial radios until cell phones and satellite radios forced the use of distinctive nomenclature. &#0160;</p>
<p>Credit to Pete Kaminski, who has used the word &quot;incipient links&quot; to describe the deliberate use of wiki pointers to nowhere, and to Tom Munnecke for Nooron and the phrase &quot;unknowledge management&quot;. Pete also gave me &quot;great weird ideas&quot;, where this clearly fits.</p>
