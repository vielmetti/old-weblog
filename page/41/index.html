I probably failed. Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service. Busch&#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-03-18-a-visit-to-dexter-after-the-dexter-tornado/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff. Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-02-18-ann-arbor-municipal-irritant/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable. Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don't always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it's possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-09-personal-public-and-team-wikis/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Last night, as I was sleeping, I dreamt - marvelous error! - that I had a beehive here inside my heart. And the golden bees were making white combs and sweet honey from all my old failures.

Within were the golden bees straining out the bitter past to make sweet-tasting honey, and white honeycomb. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-23-anoche-cuando-dormi%CC%81a-three-translations/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>BJ Fogg is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce three tiny habits that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-21-grand-resolutions-vs-tiny-habits/">&raquo;</a></p>

The outage affects over 1400 customers in Burns Park, Lower Burns Park, and along South State Street.
