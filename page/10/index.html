<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They

<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>One of the tools that I rediscovered and have been really happy for
having done so is &ldquo;jq&rdquo;, a command line tool that bills itself as
&ldquo;awk for json&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing awk code since 1985, and some limited subset
of it is something that I know really, really well. awk, however,
is from the punchcard era, and as such it likes to deal with records
that are all on one line each. Parsing JSON in awk is very clumsy
and ad hoc and really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well. Since most Internet
APIs these days have some kind of JSON encoding, it means that you
can&rsquo;t simply dash off an awk one-liner to consume and transform
Internet input data.</p>

<p>jq fixes that situation. Here for example is a one line renderings of a common task I look to solve with municipal data as a test of any new tool development: analysis of parking data. This code sample prints the total number of open spaces in the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority&rsquo;s garages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>curl -s http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json |
  jq "[.countdata[].spacesavail | tonumber] | add" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to explain how jq works, except to note that
it&rsquo;s constructed in order to be a filter: data comes in one JSON
object at a time, and the script iterates over them, transforming
them in some way and then passing JSON out the other end. This makes
it perfect for ad hoc Unix pipeline efforts where you&rsquo;re chipping
away at a data set trying to make sense of it by successively
refining it as you go.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve built jq pipelines for this Ann Arbor parking data, for AAATA
bus system data, and for the Marquette Park Cemetery data. The
parking data is straightforward, since it exits the system as JSON.
Bus system data is only incrementally harder; it started either as
HTML or as XML, and for that you want to use &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; and &ldquo;xml2json&rdquo;
in your pipeline. The Park Cemetery data set started as JSON via
the Socrata SODA API, but I needed little bits of &ldquo;sed&rdquo; and &ldquo;perl&rdquo;
to smooth out some rough edges in the source data; it really wants
to end up as GeoJSON when I&rsquo;m done, but it isn&rsquo;t there quite yet.</p>

<p>Shell programming is my favorite programming environment. Any time
I can take a set of well-understood tools and crunch through big
data sets with only a few lines of code, I&rsquo;m happy. The challenge
of shell programming is that it&rsquo;s full of opportunities to get
things just a little bit wrong with parsing; by making JSON the
data format that&rsquo;s shoveled between programs rather than a flat
one-record-per-line text format, you open up the opportunity for
pulling apart rather complex structures and manipulating them with
hardly any work.</p>

<p>For further reading, see Jeroen Janssens new book <a
href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/">Data Science at the
Command Line</a> which works you way through dozens of tools like
this that can help manage big data without big programs.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-05-notes-on-building-the-marquette-park-cemetery-finder-app-for-code-michigan/">Notes on building the Marquette Park Cemetery finder app for Code Michigan</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I'm working on a tool or a set of tools to assist people in finding grave sites in the Park Cemetery in Marquette, Michigan as a part of a project for Code Michigan. I'm working with a team that's based in the U.P. to do this, and we're collaborating over Google Hangouts. Code Michigan is a hackathon, so this project timeline is compressed to a single weekend. The team is Edward Vielmetti, Jim Argeropoulos, Chris Marr, and Lynn Czarnecki Makela. </p>

<p>My motivation for picking the grave finder app is a personal one. My grandmother, Ada Burt Vielmetti, is buried in Park Cemetery, and I've never visited the grave because I didn't know where it was. The cemetery covers over 100 acres so it's impractical to just wander around until you find what you're looking for, and there wasn't an online finder's aid. When the Code Michigan challenge came about it was an obvious task to tackle.</p>

<p>It turns out that providing detailed location data for individuals seeking to find people inside this cemetery is a common civic task. The role of the sexton, aside from care for the physical properties inside the cemetery, is to guide people to where they are looking for. This could be the grand burial grounds of famous and wealthy people with a beautiful mausoleum, or it could be a simple marker underfoot. In any case the challenge is to provide someone with enough guidance so that they can get close enough to the spot that they can locate exactly the one spot that is of interest.</p>

<p>Some notes on technology:</p>

<p>The maps problem for any geolocation task relies heavily on work that's been done before. Base maps of the city are available from Google, but the Google panopticar has not traversed all of the cemetery lanes and the Google map doesn't show the structure of the roads that you can walk or drive down. Open Street Map is better, in that it does have more detail within the cemetery, but it doesn't go down to the individual grave level.</p>

<p>On top of the base map with roads, there's a plat map showing the sections of the cemetery that's available in PDF format from the city. Our team took this plat map, field checked it, and encoded plat boundaries as GeoJSON files so that we had an accurate representation of the area within the cemetery that an individual could be located. This brings the task down to a range, rather than a specific point, but it's practical enough and a small and precise enough area to be a useful first step.</p>

<p>The data about individual burial locations in Park Cemetery was provided to use using the Socrata SODA API. A challenge here was that the "location" field, a critical one for our use, was encoded in such a way that a simple download of the data would not yield an immediately usable result since the location (in latitude and longitude) of an individual grave is not known. We addressed that issue by using the API's JSON download function to return not only the valid fields in the data but also the ones marked invalid, and a post-processing step cleaned the data to extract a valid "plat" field from the provided data.</p>

<p>JSON is a very easy to manipulate format, and I used two tools that are documented in the new book <a href="http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/">Data Science at the Command Line</a> by Jeroen Jansens. "jq" is like sed for JSON data – you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text. "json" offers powerful and flexible tools for taking JSON data and printing it in flexible formats. Between those two tools and a bit of other Unix command line efforts with "sed" and "perl", it was possible to write a handful of one-line transformations that take the Socrata data and turn it into a more compact JSON and HTML format for use directly inside applications.</p>

<p>By running these transformations on the 12,000 plus record original dataset, I was able to pull out just the location information and basic personal details for everyone - including my Nana. This gets turned into a series of files, one per cemetery section, sorted by lot number so that there's a chance that you could walk a section methodically and have the data be your guide to whether you are close to what you're looking for.</p>

<p>To publish the data in a format that is useful to the world, I turned to an old favorite, Localwiki. This comes with a number of useful tools right off the bat. At one file per cemetery section (e.g. <a href="https://localwiki.org/marquettemi/Marquette_Park_Cemetery_-_Jenney_W">Jenney W</a> the sorted HTML list loads easily into the list. The GeoJSON we created can be imported using the Localwiki API, or cemetery areas or points can be hand-plotted on an OpenStreetMap based map. Names for which Localwiki has more information can be linked. (I resisted the temptation to link every name, though if you had more coverage it would be the obvious next step). </p>

<p>Localwiki is good for this effort for a few reasons. It has a local search tool that lets you type in a name and get something in return. While not as precise as a purpose-built search tool, it's easy to implement, and at 12,000 records spread out into a few dozen sections no individual file is too big to load. We know that Localwiki is good for local search, and eventually when the pages are indexed they will be reachable by Google search as well. </p>

<p>The community aspect of civic data use with Localwiki is an important one. No municipal employee can ever hope to gather biographical data on 12,000 cemetery residents, but we want to support citizens in their interest to collect and refine as much detail as they need to memorialize or to research personal and community history.</p>

<p>In addition to loading Park Cemetery data into Localwiki, we also pursued a prototype of a purpose-built application designed specifically for mobile phone sized screens that would provide a name index and a plat finder for people who are on site. The goal is to reduce the complexity of the problem down to type in a name and get something back on a map that includes a dot saying where you are. This system uses Drupal as a back end, with maps provided through a responsive front end system specially adapted to look good on a mobile phone sized screen. Links are provided to Localwiki for reference data, and the design includes ways for individuals to quickly add to or verify location information so that you can pinpoint a spot.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Some lessons learned from the effort, which isn't done yet but getting close!</p>

<p>It's important to have a variety of skills on your team. We divvied up the problem into parts that were simple enough for each of us to tackle based on our own skills, and sorted through coordination issues via periodic Google Hangout calls. When you're working using tools you are good at and on things you find challenging but not impossible, there's a lot of room for making progress in a short time.</p>

<p>Tools and standards help. We discovered GeoJSON mid-day through day 2, and were able to use it almost immediately to extend our data to be reusable without recoding on multiple platforms. Similarly, the combination of the Socrata SODA API and the powerful "jq" and "json" tools turned a complete data processing problem into a handful of lines of code.</p>

<p>When there's a real problem to be solved, it's easier to see that you are successful. Two members of the team have family members buried in Park Cemetery. With the toolset we developed, we were able to find those graves, photograph the headstones, and decide how to incorporate that data into Localwiki. Knowing now that the problem is solvable with the data provided, it simply follows to extend that solution to a broader set of tasks.</p>

<p>Usable prototypes are more valuable than pixel-perfect finished products. Localwiki let me test ideas almost immediately, without much more than a little bit of coding needed to get to a point where a search engine would return a useful result. The tooling we built for the mobile app got to a usable demo phase promptly. A handful of photographs from the field were enough to not only field-check the data that we had, but also to better understand what we could do when there was more time to do it.</p>

<p>A weekend is not a lot of time to get much beyond the prototype stage.</p>

<hr />

<p>We're not done yet. The contest rules want a video, and we're working on the storyboard. The coding is done, but Localwiki is never really done, and there are some pages to make more spiffy and full of useful content. But in some sense I feel like we've already succeeded, in that a completely hidden system got turned into something that I'm starting to understand.</p>

<p>The proof, perhaps, is that we were able to put together a team that answered the question: where is Nana buried? The proof below.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Throwing out some notes here for a panel I'm on at the #micities conference at the Michigan Union today October 4, 2014.</p>

<p>The questions are around open data, considered as data published by a government agency that has a</p>

<ul>
<li>well defined data format (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML documented API, etc)</li>
<li>well defined access path via Internet (HTTP, FTP, API)</li>
<li>well defined terms of use and reuse</li>
</ul>

<p>Census data is perhaps the most openly open of open data. The worst would be PDFs of spreadsheets only available via FOIA, which fail on data format, access, and copyright.</p>

<p>There are multiple audiences for open data, each with separate goals and plans for their use of the data. A lot has to do with risk taking in the use of the data and in where the benefits to use flow.</p>

<ul>
<li>enterprise: well understood data, no question about long term access</li>
<li>startup: questions about access, format, permissions; risk taking, experimental, commercial</li>
<li>civic: using data to guide policy or management of resources; not overtly commercial</li>
<li>makers: experimental, interest driven, risky but not necessary political or commercial</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't see that breaking down use by status (private, public, non-profit) is the right way to slice this. You can have non-profits with enterprise-class IT operations, only willing to try things if they are sure they will work, or non-profits with goals that allow them to experiment. The focus on willingness to cope with uncertainty is the division that seems to be most helpful.</p>

<p>The Value of open data initiatives depends on the audience. Not every data provider recognizes or acknowledges every possible audience. Some data providers and gatekeepers are actively at risk if the data under their stewardship is opened up too much, so there may be a negative value to data access.</p>

<p>Some metrics for usefulness include</p>

<ul>
<li>profit or cost avoidance: simple easy to reckon monetary measures</li>
<li>opportunity seeking, potential value, chance for risky ventures to succeed</li>
<li>good governance, improve (or at least change) civic involvement in decision making</li>
<li>civic engagement, getting people involved with operations as a goal unto itself</li>
</ul>

<p>Controls for civic data are in part administrative and in part political. State and federal laws constrain what kinds of data can and should be released, for privacy, security, and policy reasons. Beyond that, there are costs associated with open publication that have to be weighed against budgets. Sometimes the publication of data imposes costs on an agency that are not recovered, and the profits or gains flow to private groups.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too.</p>

<p>Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don't have enough oomph to take on an Internet's worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet.</p>

<p>If I were looking at standards and formats I would look at traditional Internet protocols and formats (HTTP, JSON), at older serial data networks (like RS-232 or even MODBUS), and I'd get a grasp on how you might communicate over radio networks like the 915 Mhz ISM band or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). I'd also look at publish/subscribe systems like MQTT, and lightweight data retrieval systems like COAP, and I'd be aware of all of the things you might do over a simple TCP connection. And then I'd look at the security of all of this (and weep, sometimes, because it's not easy.)</p>

<p>The internet of things world hasn't condensed into a single system, and because of its origins it's unlikely to do so. Picking which of three or four possible solutions could work for your application - one of which might be HTTP - is good. Deciding which fits the right sweet spot of skills, costs, and time to deploy is another good way to think about it.</p>

<p>My power outage tracker page is a good early warning of problems with the power grid. By looking at what web pages people are clicking through on, I can see where the troubles are. The <a href="http://stormcenter.oncor.com/default.html">Oncor Storm Center</a> page was what people were focusing on, so I took a look. Oncor's map is built by iFactor, which does maps for a lot of utility companies. Alas the most useful view for a big storm - outages by zip code - is hidden under a menu, but once you find it you can get a nice colorful overview of where things are the worst.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/issue-tracker-a-github-project-for-personal-productivity.html">first wrote up the experience</a> I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/11/octodroid-is-a-github-client-for-android.html">Octodroid</a> as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: left;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d img-responsive" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-03 at 9.38.40 AM" title="Screen Shot 2014-10-03 at 9.38.40 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0791947f970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>

<p>The new thing in my life (to go with the new laptop) is <a href="http://www.neat.io/bee/">Bee</a> (@thebeeapp), a Mac native client that's a front end for several issue tracking systems. I have a free 30 day trial, after which the software looks like it could be reasonably priced if I were to use it all the time. Notably it's software-as-software, not software-as-a-service, so I'd just buy it and not have to pay every month for it.</p>

<p>Bee gives you a nice GUI for your issues, so that you can sift through the debris of what you thought you wanted to do and comment on, reassign, close, or edit those things. The net effect for me over a few hours of use was to flush out about two dozen things that had been obscured by my previous issue management regime that I was never going to do or that were totally overtaken by events. </p>

<p>The "getting things done" ritual speaks of a weekly review, where you once a week sort through all of the detritus that had landed on your todo list over the course of a week and make sense of it all. The ability to take on a review like that depends crucially on whether you can get everything that's on your plate into a single list that you can walk through methodically (and in some sensible order) so that you're not horribly fatigued by issue overload by the end. Perhaps it's the new app smell that makes it possible for me to do that anew, but I was really happy with Bee as a way to work through a review, and I'm hopeful that it keeps giving me insights and inspiration as time goes on.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Answers to questions sent to Greg McDonald, CTN manager, regarding closed captioning at on City of Ann Arbor's Community Television Network.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you providing closed captioning?</strong></p>

<p>The Commission on Disability Issues made a request to add captions to their meetings to increase meeting accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Who is providing the closed captioning for CTN?</strong></p>

<p>ScreenLine, L.L.C.</p>

<p><strong>How much is the size of the contract, and for how long does it run?</strong></p>

<p>We do not have a contract with the company, we’re in a trial period and they’ll be invoicing us each time we use their service.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the individuals who are doing the closed captioning based? Are they on-site, or off-site?</strong></p>

<p>Off-site, based in Grand Ledge, Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>When was the decision made to add closed captioning to the Disability Commission?</strong></p>

<p>The Disability Commission request for closed caption services was approved as part of the FY2015 budget discussion at the Feb. 25, 2014 Cable Commission meeting.  </p>

<p><strong>Are there considerations of adding closed captioning for City Council meetings?</strong></p>

<p>Funding would have to be identified in order for closed captioning services to be provided for City Council or other Board and Commission meetings cablecast by CTN.  </p>

<p><strong>What has changed about the technology to make closed captioning feasible now when it wasn't before?</strong></p>

<p>The technology/equipment has improved and is a little less expensive today than when last researched in 2008. The closed caption service costs are about the same. The May 27, 2014 Cable Commission meeting includes (about 6:30 minute mark) discussion about the service and equipment  <a href="http://a2govtv.pegcentral.com/player.php?video=507268f61855facce4fbff749ad0ad94">video</a></p>

<p><strong>Are the transcripts from the closed captioning available as well?</strong></p>

<p>We have no transcripts from the closed captions.</p>

<p><strong>One last question: what does one hour of closed-captioned video cost, under your current arrangement with Screenline? Is there a list price, and did we get a discount? I listened to the Cable Commission discussion you linked to (thanks for that) but was no wiser as to the hourly rate from that discussion.</strong></p>

<p>The cost is $100/hr and each meeting will require a minimum of 1hr of set-up/prep time but that could vary/increase depending upon the agenda.  As far as I know, we have not been given a discount, however ScreenLine has been very helpful as we were getting the technical part of the system set-up and did not charge us for any of their time during that.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><strong>Editorial debt</strong> accumulates when the passage of time makes a document
less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited
to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.</p>

<p>For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many
ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps
in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which
can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself
out. A proper self-contained story will be true in its time, even
if the story so far is incomplete.</p>

<p>For slow-moving stories that you want to keep accurate over time,
you write things that pretend to be timeless but that are no longer
true. Details too small to warrant a complete rewrite of the narrative
are now wrong, and the text needs minor but significant edits to
reflect current reality.</p>

<p>A similar concept is bit-rot, the notion that software degrades
over time and no longer works as well as when it was released.
That can occur as a result of changes in the operating system,
changes in the working environment, adaptations by users and
appropriation of features that were not completely thought through,
or just changes in fashion.</p>

<p>How to mark things that are signs of editorial debt to come?
Words like "now" are dangerous, or "currently"; the page does
not know when that time is past. It would be better to explicitly date the
elements that are tied to time, so that you can instead say
"in October 2014", which will always be true even if circumstances 
change later.</p>

<p>What results can be a patchwork of text that tries to be
universal but that always looks dated. Balancing the narrative
with "it used to be this way but now it's this way" versus
deleting the old obsolete text and just starting fresh, now
there's a challenge.</p>

<p>Wiki is really bad for accumulating editorial debt. Text written
in an encyclopedic style really wants to be true, and not just
a snapshot in time of one of many possible states along the
evolution of an idea. Consider a timeline as an editorial structure
that puts the age of the idea primary in the narrative, so that
it's clear when the idea that you had needs to be revisited.</p>

<p>Compare with "technical debt", used to describe code that needs to
be cleaned up that drags down progress.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2012/12/750wordscom-a-writing-environment-for-a-daily-writing-exercise.html" target="_self">750 word essay</a> every day.</p>
<p>I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone. The morning ritual of daily coffee and wifi usually produces something publishable, though often it&#39;s much shorter. You might only clip and save and share a single tweet&#39;s worth of someone else&#39;s work and call that a success to capture the idea of the moment.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t sit down and write all the time, though. There&#39;s meetings to go to, code to struggle with, people to see, places to go, dinner to cook, and the endless slog of Internet to wade through. When I do have a chance to write to produce things, it&#39;s often 50 words there, 10 words here, a click of a button there. It&#39;s not always long, extended efforts.</p>
<p>The long, extended efforts are fun, don&#39;t get me wrong, and they really focus the mind and help me think about topics for much longer than I would otherwise. The ideal writing environment gets all of the distractions out of the way and shuts out the beep-beep-beep of interrupts that otherwise drive my efforts. Getting away from interrupts turns out to be really hard work, and obtaining an uninterrupted stretch that allows such a focus is a rare treat.</p>
<p>What would you focus on if you had 750 words of uninterrupted focus every day? It should be enough to dig deep into a topic, not just to hit the surface but to wallow around in it, trying out lots of options.</p>
<p>I&#39;m cutting this self-reflective essay off at about 300 words, because there are 450 words that I&#39;d rather apply to something else.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The unit of analysis is the parking structure. It has a capacity c, and a usage u(t) for any time t observed.</p>
<p>If u/c &gt; 0.8 the structure is congested; at u/c &gt; 0.9 the structure is full. That reduces the time series of usage for a given structure into one of three values (green, yellow, red). Some public policy goal wants to keep the structures congested (to maximize revenues) but not full (to minimize complaints).</p>
<p>Given a series of values over a range of time, you want to summarize those numbers. Do you pick the worst value (&quot;we were temporarily full&quot;), the average value, the mean value? Some decision needs to be made. If you have frequent measurements you could conceivably show this as a continuous series with lots of data points.</p>

      <p>How do you organize materials such that they don't get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it's hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world.</p>

<p>I'm noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I'd have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year. It's simply not going to happen! Ditto in spades the wiki-conundrum, the more you have in your wiki the more likely it is to be outdated.</p>

<p>Perhaps the answer is to invert the problem. What do you do to make the world keep up with you? Is it easy for someone to see what you want them to see, or is your external presentation confusing? I'll note that it's easy for people to determine that I have some interest in power outages, though that's hardly the focus of my life these days.</p>

      <p>I won't be complaining about a small keyboard or a small screen for a while, but I have a lot of tools to reinstall on a new system.</p>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<p>Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there's a working full-screen mode.</p>

<p>git comes with the machine, so I didn't have to install it; it's a big part of making sure that stuff gets version tracked.</p>

<p>Node-RED. I need to have a simple programming environment that is network and device aware, and for the past few months Node-RED has been it. I'm at version 0.9.0 now. That depends first on having node.js installed, and subsequently on pulling in a lot of Node-RED dependencies.</p>

<p>Contacts. I've synced Google Contacts with the Apple address book; that took an extra step since I'm using 2-factor authentication at Google. The CardDAV support is new to me.</p>

<p>Dropbox. Plug it in, it just works. Next.</p>

<p>Google Drive. Plug it in, it seems to work; lots to sync including a lot of photos and a lot of unsorted old crap.</p>

<p>One of the things I'm realizing is that yes, there's lots of "unsorted old crap" on this which is still a new machine. </p>

<p>XCode, that's a mighty big download.</p>

<p>Apple Software Update is patching the shellshock vulnerability, I hope.</p>

      <p>Github is not much fun on a very small screen.</p>

<p>Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn't so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone.</p>

<p>None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki.</p>

<p>Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process. Short of getting a bigger screen, I don't see any way to support that kind of flow on a small device.</p>

<p>I simply do not see enough on this little device screen to make it useful for assisting decision making about what to do next. While an omnipresent device is ideal for instant response to the top of the inbox, it is really limiting for handling overflow situations.</p>

<p>If I had to stick to the small screen indefinitely I would cancel some projects that are just too frustrating to keep up with. Surprisingly, blogging would stay. Pushing out commentary in an unlinked one way scroll only demands a modest typing skill and has only a minimum need for structure. </p>

      <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived.</p>

<p>Libraries have traditionally clipped obits in the service of local historians and genealogists to help the info seeker. From time to time I have posted or reprinted obits here, and Arborwiki collects them as well, unevenly but diligently.</p>

<p>What would you have if your collection had every obituary printed for a city, carefully indexed and cross referenced? The big challenge I can imagine is disambiguation, making sure that you can tell the many people apart who share a name and a home town. </p>

      <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.</p>

<p>For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. So even though I am not keeping up with private discourse, my public engagement with the tiny part of the net that reads blogs is going just fine.</p>

<p>The strong temptation is to head to the Apple store and buy something fast, fancy, shiny, waterproof, coffee proof, and with a solid keyboard. I don't know if that device exists. Until then the cup of coffee always goes to the far right of the small screen so I know where it is at all times and so I don't knock it over again.</p>
