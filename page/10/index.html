<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Christine Bruxvoort sent me these details on the FLY Art Center's upcoming volunteer orientation.</p>

<p>When the volunteer orientation is going to be: Oct 4, 2014 4:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Where it's going to be: FLY Creativity Lab, 40 N. Huron, Ypsilanti, 48197 (between Michigan and Pearl). Contact: Chris at 734-217-2228 or info@flyartcenter.org.</p>

<p>Who is invited: Any interested adult or teen. Come to find out what we are about or sign up that night on our volunteer list. </p>

<p>What kind of commitment is asked for: on going opportunities that are posted through the volunteer sign up page. Adults can also sign up for committees like fundraising and marketing that meet monthly. Other opportunities involve working with kids or in the community at events. </p>

<p>Why you're so awesome: FLY is awesome because we are dedicated to our community and to our FLY kids! FLY means FOR the LOVE of YOUTH and we are proud to serve our area with quality arts programming that can transform our neighborhoods, develop confidence skills in our young ones, and expand the opportunities for arts and culture in our community. Our caring volunteers and staff are essential to making this happen.</p>

<p>Thanks so much! We haven't worked much yet with teens but I am excited about the possibilities of using youth as mentors to our children. Please let me know if you have anymore questions about FLY. We really appreciate your support.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here's a design for a low overhead way to post about events coming up in Ann Arbor. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/a2events">@a2events on Twitter</a> if you want to play along.</p>

<p>The first rule of business is that every event has to have a URL, and the more simple and direct the URL is the more likely it is that it's authoritative for the event. If an event doesn't have a URL yet, I'll blog about it here if I need to post about it.</p>

<p>The second rule of business is that I'm not keeping a calendar, just a feed, and the feed is not going to be a 100% comprehensive feed; you have to be prepared to get events info from multiple sources and I'm just one of them.</p>

<p>The third rule of business of course is that if you want to pay for this service we'll find a way to let you pay, though the specifics are TBD.</p>

<p>My basic idea for technology is to use a tag on my Pinboard account to feed a specific tag, and to use that tag to feed IFTTT to feed Twitter so that events get pushed out. I'll probably also use a Node-RED page to help construct something that does the right thing, and there will be a Slack channel on the a2b3 slack to do - something.</p>

<p>Thanks to Brian Kerr for having the foresight to reserve the name a2events.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote up a piece about how you might rewrite your resume to provide a "retcon" ("retroactive continuity") treatment, which emphasizes reinterpreting past events in such a way that they look like part of a story with a narrative arc.</p>

<p>That got me to thinking about lunch, of course, and the little hoary old story I tell about when the a2b3 group started "8 years ago". And I realize now that I can trace back continuity way longer than that.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when Sun 3/50s roamed the earth, I worked at OTA Limited Partnership as a systems guy. The company traded options, and I was a junior part of the ops team that kept the trading systems running. I wrote some code, I did some sysadmin work, I debugged flaky Proteon routers, I made sure we had a Usenet newsfeed. Life was pretty good.</p>

<p>The market was open every hour that lunch was served, so it didn't really ever make sense to leave the building during trading hours. That mean that lunch was brought in for everyone every single day. We had an elaborate scoring system where instead of you always buying lunch for yourself, you'd buy lunch for the team, and you'd get tally marks on the board to make sure that you properly were credited plus or minus depending on the number of lunches you bought. The bookshelves had a big thick binder full of menus, and we had some favorites. </p>

<p>That was my first real experience with professionals eating lunch together on a routine basis, and I'm still friends with the OTA crew, long after the last tally mark was erased. That dates to 1989 or so, which means I've been eating lunch as a grownup for about 25 years.</p>

<p>I realize now that if I were ever to get a real job again, one of my interview questions would have to be "what do you do for lunch around here". If the answer is wrong, I can't take the job. </p>

<p>Thanks to David Bloom for prodding me to tell more of a back story, and to my former daily lunch companions at OTA (including specifically John Hritz who is an a2b3 regular) for initiation into a professional lunch ritual.</p>

<p>You're invited for lunch at Bell's Diner on Thursday 9/11. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 weekly lunch meetup group</a> will let you say yes or no; if you're not coming, I'll still see your smiling face in the app, and it would be good to hear from you.</p>

<p>thanks again</p>

      </h3>
      <p>So you're writing a resume or a CV or a biographical sketch. What do you need to say to make you into a superhero with a fantastic back story that hints at your future greatness?</p>

<p>Retcon comes from "retroactive continuity", a plot device first used in comic books. See <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=retcon">Urban Dictionary</a> for a fun definition.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that once I go back far enough and create some retroactive continuity that I'll be able to describe my life as a set of 30-year projects, many of which are already in progress and that run in parallel and not just one after the other.
Some short-term jobs can be reconned into parts of a longer narrative arc if you tell you stories right; that makes the resume shorter.</p>

<p>Goodness knows my work history is complex enough that some new hire HR operative is unlikely to make sense of it. Better to do the comic book treatment of it and cast myself in the best possible light for the circumstances.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor District Library is really quite good about getting copies of new books for its bookshelves. You can <a href="http://www.aadl.org/contactus">request a title</a> online, and very few reasonable requests for in-print materials available from publishers are turned down. (I haven't tried the equivalent for self-published books, but I suspect it's harder; that would be a good question.)</p>

<p>Alas, requesting a book does not immediately add you to the request list for the book, so you need to keep a task alive to search for the title or author in the hopes that it shows up soon enough (with "0 copies owned", so it's on order but not yet arrived) for you to be on the list quickly.</p>

<p>Some of the books I've requested that I hope are going to make it to the bookshelves soon.</p>

<p>Sarah Granger's <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1456844">The digital mystique : how the culture of connectivity can empower your life</a> - I've been looking forward to this ever since Sarah started working on it. It promises to be a concise guide into how to apply digital communications to real-world every day living. I'm 4th of 4 holds.</p>

<p>Ben Parzybok's <a href="http://smallbeerpress.com/forthcoming/2014/03/31/sherwood-nation/">Sherwood Nation</a>  - "Sherwood Nation is a post-collapse non-apocalyptic novel! It is the story of the rise and fall of a micronation within a city. It is a love story, a war story, a grand social experiment, a treatise on hacking and remaking government, on freedom and necessity, on individualism and community." Not in the catalog yet.</p>

<p>Telegraph messenger boys : labor, technology, and geography, 1850-1950 / Gregory J. Downey. "In Telegraph Messenger Boys Gregory J. Downey provides an entirely new perspective on the telegraph system: a communications network that revolutionized human perceptions of time and space. The book goes beyond the advent of the telegraphy and tells a broader story of human interaction with technology and the social and cultural changes it brought about." Requested via MELCAT.</p>

<p>Dear reader, what books are you waiting for at the library?</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR - Sunday, 7 September, 2014 - This letter was sent to all Ann Arbor Public Schools families and staff. The worst of the traffic will be in south Ann Arbor where there's detours on the Stone School bridge over I-94 and the Eisenhower bridge over over the Ann Arbor Railroad.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Dear AAPS Families and Staff,</p>

<p>We want to check in this evening to update you on our AAPS status regarding the numerous impacts of the storm that passed through our area on Friday evening. </p>

<p>We have been monitoring our school buildings throughout the weekend, and are pleased to report that, at this time, all AAPS schools have power and are fully operational. </p>

<p>However, we also understand that a number of situations in Ann Arbor continue that may affect travel to and from schools tomorrow. </p>

<p>Many traffic lights across the area are still not working and the Eisenhower Bridge between S. Industrial Hwy. and Boardwalk has been closed since Friday night (two power line poles are leaning dangerously and so the bridge has been closed until DTE addresses this issue).</p>

<p>This road closure along with the existing Stone School Rd. closure compounded by the various signal lights that are out across the community will make for a very busy and hectic Monday morning.</p>

<p>Please know that we expect delays in our bus service tomorrow morning that will continue until DTE completes these repairs. </p>

<p>Transportation will be re-routing buses to minimize the impact, and yet we anticipate delays in both bus and car travel to and from school tomorrow.</p>

<p>In addition, we want to remind everyone that there are still areas throughout the community with active power lines down. These areas should be well-marked by now, but please be cautious and let's remind all our students to be very careful to stay clear of any areas that may have downed power lines. </p>

<p>Thank you for your patience as we all deal with the fallout from Friday night's storm that continues to impact our community.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jeanice Swift
Superintendent</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Beer Stew</p>

<p>From Tish Osborn- Originally from Ada Vielmetti (Nana) &amp; Aunt Florence Burt</p>

<p>To serve @ 6 people, use:</p>

<p>4 lbs. Of good Stew Meat</p>

<p>2 lb. Onions, thickly sliced</p>

<p>Flour to dredge meat</p>

<p>Oil to brown meat, in a large skillet</p>

<p>6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed</p>

<p>3T Dark Brown Sugar</p>

<p>¼ cup red wine vinegar</p>

<p>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</p>

<p>2 small bay leaves, put in whole</p>

<p>1 t. dried thyme leaves.....  Or 2 tsps. of fresh</p>

<p>1 T. salt</p>

<p>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>

<p>2 bottles of GOOD beer.  I often use English Stout</p>

<p>2 10 ½ oz cans of Beef Broth [not Consume`]</p>

<p>[Dumpling mix…. recipe below, put on at end of cooking time.]</p>

<p>·        Cut beef into bite-size pieces.  Dredge in flour and brown in skillet with a little oil, before putting in an ovenproof casserole dish.  [I use a large roaster]</p>

<p>·        When all beef has been browned, add a little more oil, and sauté onion and garlic just until soft.</p>

<p>·        Add the onion and garlic to the casserole with the meat; except beer and broth.</p>

<p>·        Mix well.</p>

<p>·        Add broth to skillet to de-glaze pan.  Add all other ingredients, and stir to make sure sugar is dissolved. Pour over meat mixture and stir again. </p>

<p>·        Add beer.  Stir all together.</p>

<p>·        Cover casserole and cook at 325 degrees for @ 2-3 hours.</p>

<p>·        Note:  The stew will appear to be very runny.  The dumplings seem to absorb some of the liquid. </p>

<p>·        Mix dumplings together just before you are ready to serve stew.  Drop spoon dumplings on top of meat, put the lid back on the casserole and bake for 15 minutes without lifting lid.</p>

<p>·        Serve, and expect accolades. J</p>

<p>I often just mix up Bisquick dumplings....but here’s the original recipe.</p>

<p>[Optional Dumpling recipe]</p>

<p>2 cups sifted self-rising flour</p>

<p>¾ cup of milk</p>

<p>2T. Melted butter</p>

<p>A little chopped parsley if you like, for flavor.</p>

<p>Mix together and drop on the stew.  Cook 15 min as directed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The challenge I put to myself is to spend not more than $100 and get a functioning solar powered charging station. The alternate name is a "camping power supply" for off-the-grid operations.</p>

<p>Breaking down the components it looks like this would be a combination of the following:</p>

<p>Solar panel. Estimate as a start that you want to generate 40 watts of power at peak times, using a panel that's small enough and portable enough that you can move it to where there's the best sun, but not necessarily so portable that you're carrying it with you in your backpack.</p>

<p>Voltage regulator. Take the power off the panel and regulate it so that it can provide a safe and steady 12 volt current. </p>

<p>Deep cycle battery. Provide a battery backup for your system, so that you have enough power to recharge a phone. Note that these might be bundled into "portable car jump starters", so shop at your favorite auto parts store too.</p>

<p>Powered USB hub. If you were building this strictly out of components, you'd look for a device that was powered by 12V and that provided 5V USB power at 2A for as many sockets as you had phones that you wanted to simultaneously charge.</p>

<p>Inverter. Convert 12V DC to 120V AC, for some small number of amps; for maximum flexibility in supporting devices that need AC. (I already have one of these in my car that's rated at 12V, 10 amps.)</p>

<p>Backpack battery pack. I'm imagining something a little bit bigger than a phone but smaller than a laptop that's just a battery brick providing USB power at 5V and 2A to charge a phone.</p>

<p>Remember that the budget for all of this is $100, so there may be unavoidable conflicts in requirements because all of this stuff just costs more than that; I don't really know.</p>

<p>I'll update this post with specific descriptions of components and approximate pricing available in late 2014.</p>

<p>UPDATE 9/9/14</p>

<p>Some brand names to start out:</p>

<p>Nokero ("no kerosene") makes direct charging devices and solar light bulbs. A device with a solar panel and no battery that can charge your burner phone (not your iPhone or iPad) runs $20-25. <a href="http://www.nokero.com">nokero.com</a> Via John Hritz, who pointed me at <a href="http://inhabitat.com/how-the-nokero-sunray-pro-power-solar-charger-saved-my-skin-my-sanity-during-hurricane-sandy/">this account on Inhabitant</a> of how a Nokero device was used during Hurricane Sandy as a cell phone charger that actually worked.</p>

<p>I've been unburdening my inbox of events notices by sending them out to Twitter. It strikes me that I could almost as easily do that here in this weblog, since there's an "events" category. The question is when you're trying to empty out an inbox what the quick path to "pass along the news" is, especially when you're not so well connected to the event that you might not even know enough to get the news promptly when things are cancelled.</p>

<p>The radio events calendar that I listen to is the WCBN-FM effort which is broadcast about eight times a day. <a href="http://www.wcbn.org/events">wcbn.org/events</a>.</p>

<p>The monthly print calendar that's the easiest to follow is the Ann Arbor Observer calendar, with such a following that its deadline schedule drives booking decisions at venues around town. The online iteration of it lives at <a href="http://annarborobserver.com">annarborobserver.com</a></p>

<p>The online calendar that was comprehensive beyond belief came from the Ann Arbor Chronicle, who aggregated online calendars from dozens of venue calendars. The Chronicle is closing shop, and so the long term true home of its calendar may change. <a href="http://events.annarborchronicle.com/html">events.annarborchronicle.com</a></p>

<p>I've been super surprised at how useful Meetup.com has been to find out about events happening around you, and to publicize upcoming events to people who are interested but who you don't already know.</p>

<p>Word of mouth is always the best way to get the word out; you're welcome to join us for lunch Thursdays. Pay for your own lunch, we have introductions at 12:30 p.m., and events are last on the agenda that tries very hard to end at or about 1:00 p.m. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch</a></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Essential components of Ann Arbor Weather Twitter:</p>

<p>In an emergency, call 911.</p>

<p>911 trunk lines can go down in storms. The Ann Arbor non-emergency police number is (734) 994-2911, put it in your cell phone.</p>

<p>Sirens: City sirens are tested on the second Tuesdays of the month at 1 pm. A small handful of us notice this and tweet SIRENS. Generally siren activation in any quantity will prompt twitter chatter. </p>

<p>Hashtags: #miwx is primary, but I also watch or post to #annarbor and #skywarn.</p>

<p>Amateur radio: get your ham radio license (check), an inexpensive handheld 2m VHF radio (check), a decent antenna (check), and Skywarn spotter training (to do for 2015). During severe weather monitor N8DUY 145.15 Mhz, located at the corner of I-94 and M-14 in Scio Township. Someone, somewhere, should have a Broadcastify feed for a scanner listening to that channel with backup power and good solid Internet; that's a missing link right now.</p>

<p>Who to follow: you're going to have to figure some of that out by yourself, but the list https://twitter.com/vielmetti/lists/annarbor and https://twitter.com/vielmetti/lists/weather might be a good start.</p>

<p>Power outages: If you have a smart enough smart phone, get the DTE Energy mobile app. If not, add the DTE Energy number 800-477-4747 to your phone to report outages. Follow @dte_energy and use hashtag #poweroutage I guess. The DTE outage map: http://www.dteenergy.com/map/outage.html . A snapshot of the September 5, 2014 map is below after severe storms knocked out power to more than 10,000 subscribers in Ann Arbor.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen shot 2014-09-05 at 10.05.48 PM" title="Screen shot 2014-09-05 at 10.05.48 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73e105e16970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Location: if you report severe weather or storm damage or a power outage, give a neighborhood name or a cross street. If you don't know every neighborhood, Arborwiki can be a good place to look them up. Find at least one other person who is geographically nearby to you and follow them - there's no where near the neighborhood density on Twitter that there is on Facebook or email, but in Ann Arbor at least the network is dense enough.</p>

<p>Cameras: Post your favorite weather photos or videos to your favorite social network. Note that the current structure of Twitter, Instagram, and Vine all lend themselves to real-time reporting in ways that Facebook does not, but Facebook and Youtube might reach more people over all if your post is interesting. Tag with your favorite hashtag.</p>

<p>Teenage Twitter: Adults and teens don't often mix on Twitter, so it's good to follow parents of teens who will relay news and give you a heads up about what's happening. As an alternative, create a Twitter list of teenagers and don't follow them but do check in when conditions warrant.</p>

<p>Adult Twitter: Teens and adults don't often mix on Twitter, so it's good to follow teenagers whose parents are also on Twitter who will similarly relay news.</p>

<p>College Twitter: Sometimes the U of Michigan seems like it's its own city within a city, but during severe weather the official @umich account will be aware of what's going on especially if there are alerts that need to go to all students.</p>

<p>Local government Twitter: In an emergency, call 911. The @a2gov account is not always monitored, but when it is monitored during weather it can be helpful to guide you through the maze of municipal issues to report a problem.</p>

<p>Real time lightning maps: Several services have real time or near real time lightning. I like the non-commercial blitzortung.org and its companion site lightningmaps.org . </p>

      </h3>
      <p>This is a partial text of the public comments I gave at the September 3, 2014 meeting, for the record. Please incorporate these comments into the public record of the meeting. I have provided a copy of these comments to Susan Pollay in advance of my presentation.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>I wish to address two issues: copyrights on DDA maps and public notice of the Bill's Beer Garden meeting</p>

<p>The Downtown Development Authority maintains a map, created by the City of Ann Arbor, showing the official DDA boundaries. It is an essential document to define the DDA and should be readily available to anyone. However, the map contains this copyright notice:</p>

<p>"No part of this product shall be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose, without prior written permission from the City of Ann Arbor. This map complies with National Map Accuracy Standards for mapping at 1 Inch = 100 Feet. The City of Ann Arbor and its mapping contractors assume no legal representation for the content and/or inappropriate use of information on this map."</p>

<p>This is an unreasonable copyright notice, and should be replaced promptly and at the very minimum with a copyright notice explicitly allowing reuse. </p>

<p>Regarding the Bill's Beer Garden meeting:</p>

<p>A notice I received during this meeting from the Twitter account of Bill's Beer Garden noted that the venue is not open until 5:30 p.m., though the published meeting time is 5:00 p.m. In the interest of following both the letter and the spirit of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, which states in part</p>

<p>"All meetings of a public body shall be open to the public and shall be held in a place available to the general public. "</p>

<p>The signage at Bill's Beer Garden must make it clear to the public that a public meeting is being held and that the general public is able to attend. In particular, there is a concern that since this venue serves alcohol, that there may be restrictions on individuals to attend who are under the legal drinking age.</p>

<p>Thank your for your time.</p>

<p>Stephen,</p>

<p>Redistricting maps available on the city's website contain the
following verbiage:</p>

<p>"No part of this product shall be reproduced or transmitted in any
form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose,
without prior written permission from the City of Ann Arbor. This map
complies with National Map Accuracy Standards for mapping at 1 Inch =
100 Feet. The City of  Ann Arbor and its mapping contractors assume no
legal representation for the content and/or inappropriate use of
information on this map."</p>

<p>We are writing to advise you that nobody needs the city's permission
for any of this, because these maps are public documents. The
Chronicle will be treating the maps as the public documents, which
they are. We will not be asking anyone for written permission to use
these maps.</p>

<p>We think you should take steps to remove the language on the maps so
that the information is not unnecessarily restricted in its possible
dissemination. [Suppose for example, the president of a neighborhood
association sees the language and mistakenly thinks that the city can
actually require her to get permission before including the map in a
neighborhood news letter, and decides to leave it out of the
newsletter, because she has no idea who to ask for permission.]</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dave</p>

<p>Comments as presented to the Ann Arbor City Council for the September 2, 2014 meeting.</p>

<p>Four very brief topics: municipal maps, public records, closed captioning and the city web site. These are my intended comments at the end of the meeting.</p>

<p>Regarding municipal maps, I would point out that any of the maps generated by the city in your packet have a very strict copyright on them prohibiting redistribution without the express written consent of the city. This is but one of several easily addressable flaws in the city mapping project.</p>

<p>Regarding public records, the current system of Legistar for publication of attachments to the agenda is very difficult in that it is impossible to search through the full text of attached items. Some municipal data activists in other cities have taken to wholesale downloading of the entire site to get around the problems with access.</p>

<p>Regarding closed captioning, it is my understanding that the Disability Commission is going to have closed captioning of its meetings, and I urge you to direct the city administrator to direct CTN to provide closed captioning of City Council meetings.</p>

<p>Finally regarding the city web site. It is more of a thing of beauty than the previous version, but in the process several hundreds of pages have gone missing, either by renaming of previous URLs or removal of content, and I urge you to take action to remedy these failings.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>Of the many facets of the criminal world, few have captured society’s fascination as 
has that of high stakes robbery. The combination of meticulousness, cunning, and 
audacity required to execute a real-life Ocean’s Eleven may be uncommon among 
criminals, but fortunately it is common enough to extract a wealth of lessons for the 
protection of high-value assets. To assist in informing the analyses and decisions of 
security professionals, this paper surveys 23 sophisticated and high-value heists that 
have occurred or been attempted around the world, particularly over the past three 
decades. The results, compiled in a Heist Methods and Characteristics Database, 
have been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, with the goals of both identifying 
common characteristics and characterizing the range and diversity of criminal 
methods used. The analysis is focused in six areas: (1) Defeated Security Measures 
and Devices, (2) Deception Methods, (3) Timing, (4) Weapons, (5) Resources, and 
(6) Insiders.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have written about here previously about Stanford researcher BJ Fogg in the context of his "Tiny Habits" project. He has a talk here from 2012 about the "motivation wave" and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low. The challenge is to get people to do things when they are motivated that allow them to expand their capacity to be on task when they are not motivated, e.g. by making it possible for them to get small and easy wins and tiny successes when their personal motivation is at a low ebb. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-08-28-building-a-marquette-localwiki/">Building a Marquette Localwiki</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I visit Marquette Michigan every summer to see family and catch up with friends and visit the place I went to high school. Every so often there's a reunion, but often it's just a matter of going back to the home town and figuring out what's up and what's what.</p>

<p>Since I've been working on Arborwiki for the better part of eight years, I thought last year that I'd give a try to make a <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi">Localwiki for Marquette</a>. Technologically it was easy to do - Localwiki makes adding new regions easy - but practically it's got some challenges. Here are notes on what it means to look at Localwiki for a rural area.</p>

<p>The first most obvious thing to note is that there often are places and locations that don't have a currently updated home page. If you want to document the area, you have to attach a lot of things to its history, and the places like closed mines, abandoned railroads, long-gone restaurants, shuttered gas stations, and the like have to be created from scratch and not simply replicated from existing content. This is typical of the history portion of any Localwiki effort, in that local histories of otherwise not notable enough for Wikipedia things demand a combination of original research and local knowledge. The page I started for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Red_Road">Red Road</a> is one example of this.</p>

<p>When you're doing a map of areas that are relatively rural, you find that the default street map used by Localwiki isn't that interesting. As much as I know it's difficult to do, I wish the system had easier ways of integrating other map sources into the effort. Street maps are really the wrong tool when you're looking at areas that are mostly woods; you'd like a topo map, maybe, and a plat map that showed land ownership, and a geological surface map that gave some hint what the land looked like and a forest map that showed which lands were in commercial forest. None of these are likely to show up in Google Maps any time soon.</p>

<p>Trails and non-motorized pathways are a big opportunity for Localwiki. My mom is working on a project for signage for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Iron_Ore_Heritage_Trail">Iron Ore Heritage Trail</a>, and I've put the bug in her ear that it might be interesting to cross-link somehow the interpretive signs on the trail with the corresponding Localwiki pages. Even getting good photography and mapping of trail heads would be a big enough project that I can imagine spending a week scouting out locations and not being done.</p>

<p>There's a concern at the Wikipedia project that linking to Localwiki pages is somehow dicey because of advertising on Localwiki, or perhaps because not enough people on Wikipedia are familiar enough with Localwiki to know what to expect when they see a page. As a contrast, there are also concerns on a Facebook group I follow about "wikishit" when people see a years-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marquette_Monster&amp;oldid=622698099">Marquette Monster</a> page that was completely fabricated.</p>

<p>I'll look for more ways to get more reliable information into the Marquette Localwiki. I'm particularly happy with the start that the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Gazetteer">Gazetteer</a> page has for listing location, and there's some long amount of work to give the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Mines">Mines</a> page its due to document the mining history of the area. I'm not sure the system has a single goal, but I'm always happy when other people pick up on it, add their piece, and make it useful to themselves.</p>
