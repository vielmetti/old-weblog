<h2 id="things-yet-to-do-in-this-weblog-setup:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Things yet to do in this weblog setup:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs etc</li>
</ul>

      </h3>
      <p>Michigan Wikipedians is a University of Michigan student association. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michigan Wikipedians (or MWiki) is a Wikipedia student organization at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The group was the first student Wikipedia club in the United States. The club is open to all students and faculty of the University of Michigan, as well as community members who are interested in Wikipedia. It meets every Monday at 8:00PM at the Language Resource Center in the basement of North Quadrangle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went to an organizing meeting Monday 30 September 2013, here's a few things I saw.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ArborWiki">ArborWiki template</a> on Wikipedia!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use this template to link Wikipedia articles to their ArborWiki counterparts, especially if the ArborWiki articles contain more information (including information of local interest more appropriate to ArborWiki than Wikipedia).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combine this with the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:ArborWiki">pages that link to this template</a> and you get a short list of forward links from Wikipedia to Arborwiki. There's a similar page of <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Entries_with_pages_in_Wikipedia">Arborwiki entries with pages in Wikipedia</a> that completes the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wikimedia Commons has a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Buildings_in_Ann_Arbor,_Michigan">Buildings in Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> category with more than 100 photos of the area.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to be a member of the Michigan Wikipedians group, simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Michigan_Wikipedians/Members">add your name</a> to the roster of active members.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Meetings are every Monday on the U of Michigan campus. I'm hoping to make it there 2d Mondays - 1st and 3d Mondays are Ann Arbor City Council, and 4th Mondays are a2civictech - and hope to see you there.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2013/09/30/campus-wide-power-outage-disrupts-classes-early-monday-evening/">Daily Cal reports</a> that power went out on the U Cal Berkeley campus at 4:45 p.m. local time on 30 September 2013, and that subsequently an explosion on campus at about 6:40 p.m. injured an unknown number of people. The report includes a striking photo of a manhole on fire. The campus has been evacuated.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/9448">Berkeley scanner</a> has live audio from the area; at this writing, there were over 140 people monitoring it.</p>

<p>Parts of the UC Berkeley computer systems are down. The <a href="http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2013/09/30/power-outage-on-central-campus/">UC Berkeley News Center</a> reports this -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Update 7:27 p.m. The power outage and explosion were due to a power system failure. All are asked to leave the main campus area immediately. For updates call 800-705-9998.</p>
  
  <p>The campus is experiencing a power outage.  All classes this evening are cancelled.  Lab operations should be safely shut down and people should leave the building.  At this time, most major IT services (bspace, bconnected, etc.) are offline. When power returns, these systems will gradually come online. More information will be posted at this location.  For ongoing updates, please call 1-800-705-9998 throughout the evening.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A power outage on a 138,000 volt line that provides power to Metro North trains in New York has snarled commutes from Connecticut to New York City and has also affected Amtrak service in the busy New York - Boston corridor. Work is underway to put in a temporary fix by diverting power from surrounding businesses and neighborhoods. A backup feeder line was offline, and full service restoration may take weeks.</p>

<p>Metro North is responding by putting diesel trains into service and by running buses to try to accommodate the 130,000 daily commuters on the line, but this provides only about a third of the capacity needed for a normal commute.</p>

<p>NY Times, "Power Failure Disrupts Metro North’s New Haven Line; May Last Days", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/nyregion/metro-norths-new-haven-line-suspended-after-power-loss.html">September 25, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The disruption began after a Consolidated Edison feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed around 5:20 a.m., snarling service between Stamford, Conn., and Grand Central Terminal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CT Post, "Metro-North, Con Edison tested plan that led to failure", <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Metro-North-service-What-you-need-to-know-4845143.php">September 26, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it may take officials weeks to determine the cause, it appears the 138,000 volt line that was left to bear the burden of energizing trains along an eight-mile stretch of track in Westchester County, N.Y., from Pelham to Rye became overwhelmed and superheated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg Business Week, "Delayed NYC Commuters Ask Why Metro-North Power Failed Again", <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-09-27/stranded-nyc-commuters-ask-why-metro-north-power-failed-again#p1">September 27, 2013</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said yesterday that Con Edison representatives told him the company is working to get a portion of the electricity needed to the commuter line. The power would come from three transformers to be tested this weekend, Malloy said. He said updates will be provided to residents the night before the Sept. 30 commute. “There appears to have been little plan for this type of catastrophic failure,” Malloy said during the briefing at Grand Central.</p>

<p>This weblog gets enough hits from Twitter that I'm curious where they come from; the new Twitter tools help that curiosity. If you were managing a brand and wanted to see how effective your twittering was, this is one more measurement tool for you.

<p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck.</p>

<p>The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.</p>

<p>It's very different writing for someone else than it is for myself. Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor is not one of them. Rather, there's a terrifying time when you hit "publish" and the world either sees your headline and says "meh" or they pick it up and share it with their friends.</p>

<p>Ultimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I've written here before about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unpolished-open-notebook.html">keeping an open notebook</a> and what that means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing. But when you're writing for someone else the whole package really wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a separate set of expectations.</p>

  <p>Some weaselly-looking character from an outfit called "Just Energy" knocked on our door today. They are of course scam artists and we just tell them we are not interested. They are very pushy and actually try to mislead people into thinking they have something to do with the utility companies. The especially like to prey on the elderly. </p>

  <p>When dealing with a person who shows up at your door unannounced or without prior notification (be it a cable provider, maintenance worker, plumber, salesperson) exercise healthy levels of caution and care before agreeing to anything. If a person shows up at your door without proper notification, promptly ask to see an ID, business card or supervisor’s phone number before conducting any further business. If an individual is unable to provide any of the aforementioned forms of identification, discontinue the interaction. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-24-notes-on-meetup/">Notes on Meetup</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b" alt="Logo" title="Logo" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019aff96dcaa970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I've started using <a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> to organize several groups. Here's some notes.</p>

<p>For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">a2b3 meetup</a> which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</p>

<p>A brand new Meetup is the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">a2civictech</a> Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup, which had its first meeting the other night. This is a more classic meetup, one that tries to meet monthly rather than weekly, one that's similar to other groups around the country, and one where I'm starting out from the perspective that I mostly don't know everyone who's going to be interested.</p>

<p>Meetup is a form of civic technology (for the purpose of organizing meetings). For a2civictech, I've been able to use the function of annotating the photos from the meeting to remember who was there, and the little discussion forum around the event is just enough to prepare for meetings and remember what happened there. Meetup also allows you to track the input and output of money to the group, so it's reasonable to track expenses and reimbursement for even little bits of money.</p>

<p>The meetup system isn't free; a semi-annual fee of $72 applies. So by not being free it gives me the opportunity to have other folks help share in the cost of running things. a2civictech is sponsored in part by <a href="http://a2geeks.org">a2geeks</a> and that's been a great plus in getting it going. You can also share in the roles of actually organizing things by giving co-conspirators some additional rights to manage things.</p>

<p>What strikes me the most is that Meetup is actually designed pretty well to help you successfully organize a meeting. I'm so used to group-forming tools like Yahoo Groups and Google Groups where the goal is to have a discussion online and where the in-person efforts are a very late afterthought. The system comes with a checklist of all of the useful things you can do, and the automated emails for the event planner gently prompt you to do the right thing at the right time. There's obviously a lot of thought and evolution in this system which is a welcome change.</p>

<p>The verdict so far: worthwhile to continue for 6 months, and probably worth renewing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.</p>

<p>Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:</p>

<li><a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw/">AllRecipes</a> adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing</li>

<li><a href="http://www.bostonorganics.com/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw/re/kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw">Boston Organics</a> follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint</li>
<li><a href="http://www.floatingkitchen.net/kohlrabi-slaw-kohl-slaw/">The Floating Kitchen</a> adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.</p>

<p>The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. If something particularly interesting comes as a result of this expedition through public records, a second request should be straightforward since you know that relevant records exist because someone else already got them.</p>

<p>One of the possible problems in asking for FOIA logs is if the public body in question has multiple parts of it that answer FOIA requests, and your seemingly simple request has to get allocated to multiple places. I think this is the reason that both the City of Ypsilanti and Wayne State University asked for more than $60 in fees to retrieve a month's worth of logs - I think, but am not certain, that the fees reflected the need to go both to the administrative side of routine FOIAs as well as to police department FOIAs for the same period.</p>

<p>The bright spot in all of this has been the City of Ann Arbor, which responds promptly and without fees for requests for city FOIA logs. Every single request is numbered, so that you can be certain that you're getting the whole set, and I specifically didn't ask for police logs in that case.</p>

<p>My naive assumption going into this was that every agency would be able to produce a stack of letters that they had received for FOIA requests with minimum cost and minimum search time. That proved not to be the case. I'll need to dig deeper the next time I send such a query in to make sure I'm not inadvertently asked for too much.</p>

<p>I don't want to guess how much water (and money) was leaking down the drain, but I think I have this problem fixed for now. The next step is to replace or repair the toilet, but until then, at least it won't be a source for high water bills.</p>

<p>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.a2gov.org">City of Ann Arbor</a> for having <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/ann-arbor-water.html">detailed daily water billing</a> information online.

      </h3>
      <p>From a transcript of an 18 September 2013 interview on <a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now</a> about the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/18/the_1_000_year_flood_did">aftermath of the 2013 Colorado floods</a>. Jim Pullen is a reporter at Colorado radio station <a href="http://www.kgnu.org/">KGNU</a>, an independent community station in Boulder and Denver. Hyperlinks are my own.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NERMEEN SHAIKH: And when do you expect to learn, Jim Pullen, of the extent of the environmental contamination as a result of these floods?</p>

<p>JIM PULLEN: That, I think that is going to take some weeks, very unfortunately. There are two things going on — well there are several things that are going on that are of incredible concern. Of course, in any flood event, there are going to be a lot of contaminants in the water. There are going to be dead animals, there are going to be — there are oil stations — gasoline stations that have been inundated. People’s homes have been inundated, and people keep a lot of chemicals in their homes that are under relatively low protection.</p>

<p>We have some very serious issues here in the state of Colorado in addition to those normal flooding issues. We have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">Rocky Flats plant</a>, or what was once upon a time the Rocky Flats Plant where plutonium is underground. And there has been extensive flooding in that area. And we also have tens of thousands of active oil and gas wells in the state, 20,000 alone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weld_County,_Colorado">Weld County</a>. The industry — a lobbying group is reporting 1900 of those oil and gas wells have been shut down, and including the two largest suppliers, <a href="http://www.nobleenergyinc.com/">Noble Energy</a> and <a href="http://www.anadarko.com/">Anadarko</a> are reporting about five to ten percent of their wells have been shut down.</p>

<p>For example, Noble Energy owns 7600 wells in Weld County itself, which is right to the northeast of us. So, there are a lot of contaminants potentially floating around. And in the case of Rocky Flats, I spoke with a Christine Everson (ed. note: <a href="http://www.kristeniversen.com/">Kristen Iversen</a>?) last night and she said it is going to take weeks for laboratory results of plutonium and other contaminants to become available to the public.</p>

<p>Notes: A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24107038/state-and-industry-struggle-assess-damage-flooded-oil">Denver Post story</a> of September 16 further reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Colorado's richest oil field — the Denver-Julesburg Basin — is buried in floodwaters, raising operational and environmental concerns, as state and industry officials work to get a handle on the problem.</p>
  
  <p>Thousands of wells and operating sites have been affected — some remain in rushing waters, officials said.</p>
  
  <p>"The scale is unprecedented," said Mike King, executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources. "We will have to deal with environmental contamination from whatever source."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MILLIKEN — Industry crews have placed absorbent booms in the South Platte River south of Milliken where at least 5,250 gallons of crude oil has spilled into the flood-swollen river.</p>
  
  <p>The spill from a damaged tank was reported to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources Wednesday afternoon by Anadarko Petroleum, as is required by state law.</p>
  
  <p>State officials have responded to the spill site, which is south of Milliken near where the St. Vrain River flows into the South Platte.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Anna Clark, writing in the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/advance_changes_gears_ann_arbor_mlive.php?page=all&amp;print=true">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.</p>

<p>The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. Further, I want to make very clear the difference between urgent breaking news and the sort of slog it out, cover it every day beat journalism that is mostly interesting in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Twitter has always been good for breaking news, whether it be local, national, or global. I'm perfectly convinced that in the case of the 100-year flood, we'll be covered. There's enough individual people who are capable of writing about what's happening to them in enough local detail that if an issue is city or county wide, Ann Arbor will be notified. Newspapers always do their best work in response to crisis, and local bloggers, radio, and metro Detroit television will all chip in. If something horrible or wonderful happens, we're all good as far as news goes.</p>

<p>That can't be said for every town, by the way. When Marshall, Michigan had an Enbridge pipeline burst in its midst, there was no local news media to write about or blog about the weird hydrocarbon smell. Ann Arbor has enough of a "diffuse media ecosystem" that such things should be noticed! However, you can't even count on that - a long-seeping sewer spill in the Arboretum was unnoticed for weeks - you'd hope that we'd catch something faster here.</p>

<p>It's the problem of news that's not urgent that I'm more worried about. Small retail businesses come and go, and you can't count on the Ann Arbor News to write about all of those retail changes. Crime, petty and otherwise, gets reported when the police department wants it to be reported, and thus you'll see a lot more Ypsilanti crime in the Ann Arbor paper than Ann Arbor crime just because of the willingness of YPD to share. The <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> does a fine job of bird-dogging city council, but its ferociously detailed coverage only extends so far. The <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> only comes out monthly, but it routinely scoops the daily media.</p>

<p>Short of finding someone with more money than sense to start a new publication, what can  you do? The CJR story says that people turn to "small independent news sites to fill in the gaps." As the Ann Arbor News shrinks, the opportunity to fill in the gaps should only grow. A narrowly focused topic that's interesting and that the dwindling mainstream media only gives cursory attention to would be perfect, and if you can give the world quick and accurate writing as well as compelling photography you'll be all set.</p>

<p>Small independent news sites are usually a labor of love, in some fashion. Notably they come and go as people's priorities change or as they age out of the "independent grad student blogger" demographic. It's almost the case that you need to recruit a new crop of writers every fall, purging your blogroll of the recently departed and scouring the net for the newest up-and-coming.So the local media infrastructure is active - there's no shortage of writing about Ann Arbor, both in local and in national publications. It's also incredibly diffuse, without a single dominant comprehensive news source that covers everything in detail. My best solution to date has to be tuned in to Twitter to catch what I can as it goes past, and write down what I see that's not getting enough notice so that I can contribute my small share.</p>

  <h3>13 September 2013</h3>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-listening-to-baseball-online-with-global-tuners-radio/">Listening to baseball online with Global Tuners radio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It's not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a>. Here's how it works (and why it's hard).</p>

<p>First, you'll need a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com">Global Tuners</a> account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world. The way it works is that the receivers are hooked up to a digital front end that lets you tune them remotely and that plays back the audio through the net. In general only one person can tune in at a time, so it's first come first served. </p>

<p>Second, you'll need to have some idea of which AM and FM stations your favorite team's radio network covers. For example, the <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/det/schedule/radioaffiliates.jsp">Detroit Tigers radio network</a> has AM and FM station ranging from Houghton in the U.P. to Toledo Ohio and Angola Indiana, and the <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp">Houston Astros radio network</a> also covers San Antonio and Shreveport. If the Tigers play the Astros, you can possibly tune to either network's stations - you'll either get home or away team coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, and here's the tricky part, you'll want to figure out which of the tuners covers which of the stations you are interested in. As it happens none of the tuners cover any stations that the Tigers routinely broadcast on, but the Astros are on KTKR 760 AM <a href="http://www.ticket760.com/main.html">Ticket 760</a> in San Antonio, and there's a <a href="http://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/info.php?r=1155">receiver in San Antonio</a> that might be free to listen through to them.</p>

<p>Figuring out radio channels can be weird - some stations have higher power and transmit over clear channels for long distances, and others don't cover much more ground than the city they are based in. So the "best" channel to tune in might be for a station that's powerful but far away. When you search through the MLB.com site for stations, look for the "flagship" station listed, which often broadcasts with higher power and over a greater distance than the other stations in the network. As an example, here's a report of <a href="http://globaltuners.blogspot.com/2011/10/knbr.html">hearing the San Francisco Giants</a> from a tuner in Phoenix, AZ more than 600 miles away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The signal was weak at a distance of over 650 miles, with little interference from other stations but some noise and fading.  Nonetheless, the content was usable and the station IDs clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hobby of DXing gets an extra boost when you can tune in to radios that are far away. It's fun to scan the dial and hear what's out there. Most tuners have a band scan listing that you can see what's there. I listen to remote radio stations on <a href="http://www.tunein.com">Tunein</a> as well, but there's not the same sense of being there when the reception is too perfect, and the baseball powers that be block internet-based games over regular radio channels.</p>


  <h3>13 September 2013</h3>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-13-changes-at-annarborcom-newspaper-rebrands-as-ann-arbor-news-shuts-down-website/">Changes at AnnArbor.com; newspaper rebrands as Ann Arbor News, shuts down website</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new? Were all of the URLs that I had collected for stories on <a href="http://www.arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> going to suddenly go 404 on me? Was it going to be impossible for me to provide news clippings proving that I had produced a story every day for months on end? All a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Things are bad, but not as bad as they would seem.</p>

<p>All of the old content on AnnArbor.com is still there, but all of the navigation that would help you find it is gone. If you view the <a href="http://annarbor.com">AnnArbor.com</a> home page through your web browser it will redirect to MLive. Fortunately, any deeper links within the site still work, so you can see e.g. my <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/vielmetti/foia-friday-index/">FOIA Friday index</a> and all of the links there still work. There's even a search engine (using Google search) on that page.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aannarbor.com+vielmetti&amp;oq=site%3Aannarbor.com&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i58j69i61j69i59.1939j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#psj=1&amp;q=site:annarbor.com+vielmetti">search Google</a> for "site:AnnArbor.com vielmetti" you'll get back a page of links, but half of them won't work - any tag, category, or section in the old site redirects to MLive. This means that if you were a blogger and were carefully tagging your stuff so that it could be found again, all of that effort is gone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s "Wayback Machine" to the rescue, at least in part. That site faithfully and patiently scraped content from AnnArbor.com and stored it away forever, and it preserved enough of the links and surrounding content that it is possible to navigate up to a point. The Internet Archive's collection even includes the current temperature for the day that the page was saved! It's not perfect - some links will still break - but it's much better than nothing.</p>

<p>I've never been a fan of the MLive site - it's slow, disorienting, and hard to search through and navigate. But it's what we now have, and I don't hold out any promise for radical reinvention of that system. Rather, I expect that Ann Arbor newspaper readers will get an increasingly thin product, watered down with repurposed statewide news and ever more devoid of local identity. Fortunately there's the <a href="http://www.annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> bird-dogging civic meetings and the <a href="http://www.annarborobserver.com">Ann Arbor Observer</a> observing changes in the area, so not all is lost.</p>

<p>Some more local views on the topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/09/the-ann-arbor-news-is-back.html">Damn Arbor</a> notes that the Ann Arbor News is back, and his lead paragraph is worthwhile repeating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turritopsis nutricula, the immortal jellyfish, is unique among animals in that it can revert back to its clonal polyp stage after becoming sexually mature. In a similar process, The Com announced today that it would be reverting back to its previous state as the Ann Arbor News and reintegrating the MLive Media Group as part of MLive.com. It should be be noted The Com exists as a subsidiary of MLive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know you might be tempted to be pissed off anew over today’s announcement, but I think it bears repeating that, at least in the short term, we need for M-Live and the new twice-weekly Ann Arbor News to be successful. </p>

<p>And the national point of view:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/advance_publications_scraps_an.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a> says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advance is now about to fold AnnArbor.com (the website) into MLive.com, the company’s Michigan portal based on its hideous website template. This is what’s on the homepage of MLive as I type. Prepare to shield your eyes.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-12-boulder-colorado-flood-of-september-2013/">Boulder Colorado Flood of September 2013</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The city of Boulder, Colorado is flooded after several days of torrential rains. Here's some useful links if you want to get up to speed on what's going on.</p>

<p>Turn around, don't drown. If you're in the affected area, get authoritative news from local sources (and not this blog).</p>

<h3>Scanner</h3>

<p>For raw unfiltered news of what is happening, listen to the emergency services scanner for the Boulder area. The <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/591">Boulder County Sheriff and Fire</a> feed has over 800 listeners as of this writing. You'll want to listen through headphones, because the feed is a stereo feed with fire/rescue on one channel and police on the other.</p>

<p>A good text counterpart to this is the <a href="http://twitter.com/boulderoem">Boulder Office of Emergency Management twitter</a> feed, which has brief and authoritative updates about the situation. The <a href="http://boulderoem.org">Boulder OEM web site</a> echoes those updates in more detail.</p>

<h3>Local news media</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/">Daily Camera</a> is Boulder's daily newspaper, and it has continuous updates on the situation. Their <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_24072038/boulder-county-broomfield-under-flash-flood-warning-major">September 12 story</a> is a long list of incidents, warnings, accounts and stories about what's going on. Twitter: @<a href="http://twitter.com/dailycamera">dailycamera</a></p>

<p>There's flooding in the Denver area as well, and the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com">Denver Post</a> is on it. A <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24077193/boulder-county-flood-emergency-1-killed-streets-impassable">September 12 Denver Post story</a> notes the extent of the damage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy rain and massive flooding threatens towns and cities up and down the Front Range into the day Thursday as communities were evacuated, roads closed and emergency shelters set up.
  Three people were confirmed dead and at least one missing.
  At an afternoon news conference Boulder officials said at least 12 dams in the county had overflowed.The Boulder airport was closed as well as Boulder mountain parks and open space until further notice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>As ever, Twitter is on the scene when there's news. The #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23boulderflood">boulderflood</a> and #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cowx">cowx</a> hashtags have been trending, with photos, video, and brief accounts of what's happening. A #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23coflood">coflood</a> tag covers flooding across Colorado.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>A map has been removed per the owner's request on 25 October 2013.</p>

<p>The City of Boulder has a <a href="http://gisweb.ci.boulder.co.us/agswebsites/general/iemcop/index.htm">road closures map</a> with markers showing where roads are closed or impassible. Officials are recommending that people stay off the roads.</p>

<p>As of Thursday, September 12 in the evening I have not been able to find a good clear map that shows the full extent of affected areas, and emergency operations are still in rescue mode.</p>

<p>Google has a <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2013-boulder-floods">crisis map for the 2013 Boulder Floods</a>. This is a snapshot as of Friday, September 13, in the morning.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>This flood is being compared to the 1894 Boulder flood. The <a href="http://boulderhistory.org/boulders_great_flood.asp">Boulder History Museum</a> account of that flood reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As rains continued, adding to spring runoff, Boulder Creek began to rise. The threat of a flood was serious. Overnight, the creek rose out of its banks and rushed through the canyons above Boulder. By daybreak the creek had turned into an angry river, carrying debris from the settlements and bridges it destroyed in the mountains. In Boulder, the creek had begun its destruction as it swept the Sixth and Twelfth Street bridges downstream. The flood submerged railroad tracks, roads and farms, and tore down telephone and telegraph poles, taking Boulder’s means of transportation and communication out of commission.</p>

  <p>Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet.  This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.</p>
  
  <p>The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I don't know what other people's experiences are, but increasingly I'm finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone's wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.</p>

<p>The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks).</p>

<p>My phone has a bandwidth cap so I don't know if I can keep this up all month, and it's always better to use a fast free unlimited connection than a limited one that you bring yourself. I'm just wondering if this is a sign of a long-term trend where the wifi that you carry with yourself everywhere is faster, more reliable, and less error-prone than the "free" public infrastructure.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There's no better way to learn about your home town than by trying to start a wiki for it. In that regard, I'm happy to announce a new <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/">Localwiki installation for Marquette County, Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> crew has developed a new hosting platform for people who want to start a wiki for their area, but who don't have the resources or the time or the skills to launch their own server. It runs on <a href="http://localwiki.net">Localwiki.net</a>, and currently has about two dozen sites up and running. Your town or region could be next!</p>

<p>When I originally envisioned doing a wiki for Marquette, I was thinking ambitiously and thought "hey, I'll do the whole U.P." I'm glad I didn't, not at least yet. There's enough small amounts of nitty-gritty detail about local history, ghost towns, old mines, and bits of industrial archaeology that I have just enough knowledge to tackle for the Marquette area, but don't have any clue where I'd start for Houghton or Escanaba or the Soo. Someone else can tackle that.</p>

<p>Marquette County is the biggest county (by area) in Michigan, so there's plenty of geography to cover. It's also home to some political subdivisions like <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Humboldt_Township">Humboldt Township</a> that have less than 500 inhabitants, no post office of their own, and no chance ever that anyone there would start a wiki just for that place alone.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a>, which covers Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County, I see this as the very first step towards a project that could last a long time. At a few pages a day for a few years you could start to get to the point where you had enough material to be useful for a visitor, a local, or a historian, and where people who would never be notable enough for a first draft biography on Wikipedia might get properly noted or memorialized. I'm looking forward to learning more so that the next time I visit I'll be that much better informed.</p>

<p>I'm starting to use <a href="http://medhelperapp.com/">MedHelper</a> for Android as a tool to keep track of my medicine. As you get older, it's more and more likely that you'll be on some medication, and since I've had side effects from previous meds I'm happy to find something that helps me track things.</p>

<p>It's a relatively complicated program compared to some simple pill reminder apps on the market, but my use is relatively simple. There's a reminder function to alert you when it's time to take your medicine, a log that tracks when you actually did take your meds, and a simple comment log that lets you add notes about how it's going or any side effects you noticed. If you're doing detailed logging of weight, blood pressure, or a number of other vital signs there's a place for that.</p>

<p>At the moment there's no web-based version of it, but the site hints at a "cloud" version, which I suppose I'd welcome.</p>

<p>The test of any software like this is twofold. First, does it help you actually follow your prescription better than a simple alarm or a pillbox. Second, does it help you when you are at the doctor's office talking about your health. I haven't tested either, but I'm looking forward to updating this review when I get a few months of actual use in place.</p>

      <p>Originally seen on <a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/">Deadline Detroit</a>, my go-to place for quick hits on Detroit news - the <a href="http://metrotimes.com/">Metro Times</a> is up for sale. If you ever wanted to be in journalism now's your chance.</p>

<p><a href="http://deadlinedetroit.com/articles/6165/for_sale_the_metro_times">From the article</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company that owns the Metro Times told its Detroit staff this morning (August 26, 2013) the paper is for sale, throwing the future of the 33-year-old alternative weekly into doubt at a time of great uncertainty for print publications.</p>
  
  <p>Few details were available; employees were told not to speak to the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was noted (and I can't recall where, sorry) that there is no independent library that has a full run of the Metro Times archived, and there's a reasonable concern that if the Metro Times morgue is sold along with the paper that a big piece of Detroit music history could be lost.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A note from Steve Pierce regarding a request for ideas and code to help people log into a free WiFi mesh network. Contact him for details at bottom.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://hdl.com">HDL.com</a> and volunteers have deployed a free WiFi network in SE Michigan over the last 5 years. With over 1,000 access points deployed and 650,000 unique devices connected, <a href="http://wireless.ypsi.com">Wireless Ypsi</a> and companion networks such as <a href="http://detroitenabled.org/">Detroit Enabled</a> are averaging over 2,500 users per day, making it one of the largest free WiFi networks in the country.</p>

<p>The equipment and connections are paid for by local community groups like Focus Hope and Public Housing along with business owners and community champions. No money is charged to use the WiFi service, nor is there any advertising revenue. </p>

<p>The free network, called Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled is HDL.com’s way of giving back to the community. We help secure Internet bandwidth and donate time and equipment to support the free network.</p>

<p>The struggle we face is making sure we comply with Internet Service providers terms of service agreements. One recent requirement is to not have anonymous access to the network. While we would love to have open and free Internet for everyone, the reality is Internet service costs money and the major carriers like Comcast and AT&amp;T don’t provide the service for free. So while Wireless Ypsi and Detroit Enabled offer free WiFi for residents, business and visitors, someone still needs to pay for the connections.</p>

<p>To continue to use these paid connections we need a system that will allow people to sign up for free accounts to use the service. We want something akin to Facebook or Twitter that will allow for instant sign up and use of the free WiFi network.</p>

<p>Users would provide their name, address, phone and email address and chose a secure password. They would immediately be granted access to the network for one day. A confirmation email link is sent to the email address and it must be confirmed to continue to use the service beyond the first day.</p>

<p>Authentication would use a RADIUS server or similar service which would need to be selected, as well. We must insure proper data security and programming techniques are used to protect the data.</p>

<p>Not having a login and registration system is the single largest barrier we face today to continued large scale deployments of free WiFi. We have proven with our 5 year success story that the network is reliable and sustainable. Yet not having a login and registration system has virtually stopped us from expanding services into new areas until we can address this need.</p>

<p>Much more information about the Rim Fire, including maps, is available through <a href="http://inciweb.org/incident/3660/">InciWeb</a> system. The August 25 update reads as follows:</p>

<p>&gt; The Rim Fire continues to burn on the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park, Bureau of Land Management and State responsibility land. The fire is exhibiting continued growth to the northeast and east. On the western side of the fire, crews successfully conducted firing operations to bring the fire line down to the Tuolumne River in efforts to keep the fire from spreading to the west toward the Highway 108 corridor. Aerial resources continue to be effective in reducing the spread of fire toward the Highway 108 corridor. Crews continue to construct line construction where accessibility and safety allows. In addition, structure defense and contingency planning continues in the Mather area.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 23, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18169">declared a state of emergency</a> for San Francisco, noting that the fire threatens both power and water resources for the city.</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the wildfires that started in Tuolumne County have caused damage to electrical infrastructure serving the City and County of San Francisco, and now threaten damage to property, equipment, and resources of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department; and</p>

<p>&gt; WHEREAS the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been forced to shut down transmission lines with the result that the City and County is affected by the wildfires in the County of Tuolumne and is likely to be further affected should the fire cause additional damage to the City and County of San Francisco’s water and electrical assets in Tuolumne County, including the possible temporary interruption of electricity and/or water delivery;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.</p>

<p>Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.</p>

<p>It's worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time. Fortunately both boys are self-propelled on bicycles to get to school.</p>

<p>Apples are back in season, after a full year last year without them. The reports from market suggest that the crop is going to be a good one.</p>

<p>Football parking is back on the agenda - football itself, not so much, but the crowds that come with games can mean a juicy allowance for the intrepid soul who has a front yard and a driveway with extra spaces for cars.</p>

<p>There's a tally of the things that didn't get done this summer. Strawberry picking didn't happen (papa had a bad morning), and blueberry picking didn't work out that well (the youngest couldn't reach the high bush berries). I'm hoping that our Ypsilanti raspberry patch will be free from the fly infestation (spotted wing Drosophila) that has wiped out several other berrypicking locations nearby.</p>

<p>Farmers Market is always worth going to this time of year. Late summer suppers with green beans, tomatoes, and corn are a joy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two reports of a fire on the 900 block of Mary Street on Saturday at around 3:00 a.m. The sirens woke me up.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/garage-fire-on-mary-street-threatens-nearby-homes/">AnnArbor.com story</a> notes that a 3 car garage was destroyed and gives the "we don't know very much" report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://michigandaily.com/blog/wire/police-investigating-fire-mary-street">Michigan Daily story</a> gives more details, including a photo from neighbor Raymond Brokowski, and has this disturbing detail: it's being investigated as arson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two individuals were seen running from the scene. The <a href="http://police.umich.edu/?posting_id=299">crime alert</a> describes them as 5’11” to 6’0”, wearing dark hooded sweatshirts and blue jeans. No further description is given.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE Monday: The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/crime/2-men-suspected-of-lighting-fire-that-destroyed-ann-arbor-garage/">followup AnnArbor.com story</a> has more details, at least a little; it took them a full two and a half days from the time that the incident occurred until they ran the followup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ann Arbor police Lt. Renee Bush said police and fire personnel were sent at 3:20 a.m. Saturday to an alley behind the 600 block of Packard Street for a report of a fire. Bush said the resident of a home in the 900 block of Mary Street, who reported the incident, saw a fire in a recycling container full of cardboard.</p>

<p>The photo from Brokowski was sent out via Twitter, here's the news as it happened.<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/michigandaily">@michigandaily</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/michdailynews">@michdailynews</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FIRE&amp;src=hash">#FIRE</a> on State Street and Packard! <a href="http://t.co/kp3r1gsmG7">pic.twitter.com/kp3r1gsmG7</a></p>— Raymond Brokowski (@rbrokowski) <a href="https://twitter.com/rbrokowski/statuses/371181419847876608">August 24, 2013</a></blockquote></p>

      <p>We got some Prime Red apples at Farmer's Market from Wasem's Fruit Farm.</p>

<p>Prime Red is also known as Akane or Tokyo Rose. From <a href="http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/akane">Orange Pippin</a>, an encyclopedia of apples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Akane was developed in Japan in the 1930s, and represents an unusual marriage of the classic English early variety, Worcester Pearmain, and the high quality American heritage apple variety, Jonathan - and it is a marriage that works very successfully.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It wasn't completely internet-free, because there was wifi at my Mom's place and wifi at McDonald's for the occasional stops and wifi at the very nice Dead River Cafe in Marquette. But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn't have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.</p>

<p>There are a couple of places I would have liked to have captured in the moment while I was there with a camera and with Twitter to share them. For example, there's the cutest little gazebo-like structure on the Iron Ore Heritage Trail underneath the LS&amp;I railroad trestle. It's cute until you realize that it's there to deflect the ore pellets off the trail and off of the heads of passing bicyclists as they go under an active set of tracks.</p>

<p>I also missed there being a local wiki to look things up in (and to add my own commentary to) for the Upper Peninsula, along the lines of Ann Arbor's Arborwiki. There's a lot of history in the area that's still relatively unwritten, and it would have been fantastic to have a place to store bits of commentary and observations without necessarily broadcasting a stream of social media to my long-suffering friends.</p>

<p>I'm back, not having missed Facebook much at all, and not having been tethered to a Twitter update stream, and only 100 messages behind in my inbox.</p>

      <p>I'm still reading the darned thing, and sometimes I click on the links. But for now, at least, I'm taking a vow of silence on Facebook. No poking people, no one-click birthday wishes, and no back-and-forth banter punctuated by screen refreshes hoping that there's something else of interest to look at.</p>

<p>I like you all out there in Facebook land, but something has to give, and I'd rather be an old-school blogger that still puts out a post or two a week than an ace Facebook user with little to show for it after years of work except calluses on my fingers.</p>

<p>Ironically you will read this on Facebook, some of you at least, because I haven't yet figured out how or whether to disconnnect the automated Typepad-to-Facebook posting.</p>

      <p>I'm on vacation for a week up north, but news still hits my inbox. Here's a very brief take on some things that I have learned while I've been gone that deserve to be dumped out into the internet so that our fine intelligence agencies have something more to chew on.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://twitter.com/bobneedham">Bob Needham</a>, long time Ann Arbor News and AnnArbor.com entertainment editor, has left the friendly confines of the newspaper industry to join the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business as a "paragraph wrangler". </p></li>
<li><p>Whittaker's Berry Farm in Ida, MI is closed for the season early because of an invasion of <a href="http://www.ipm.msu.edu/invasive_species/spotted_wing_drosophila">Spotted Wing Drosophila</a> (SWD). This vinegar fly ruins crops and is a relatively recent immigrant to Michigan (2010).</p></li>
<li><p>The Washtenaw County Road Commission has taken to telling anyone who wants information about the roads to <a href="http://www.wcroads.org/sites/all/themes/wcroads/pdfs/foia-request-form.pdf">file a FOIA request</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>Damn Arbor editor Ben Connor Barrie has <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/08/coming-clean.html">moved to Ypsilanti</a>, prompting Mark Maynard to run an <a href="http://markmaynard.com/2013/08/ypsilanti-immigration-interview-erika-jost-and-ben-connor-barrie/">immigration interview</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Chris Dzombak is <a href="http://arborwx.com/2013/08/21/closing-down-arborwx/">closing down</a> the hyperlocal ArborWX weather blog in favor of slightly broader pastures; he'll be an <a href="http://chris.dzombak.name/blog/2013/08/my-next-step.html">iOS developer for the New York Times</a> starting this fall.</p></li>

      <p>On August 15 2013, Cisco announced that it would be laying off 5% of its workforce, or about 4000 employees. Some details:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130814/p29#a130814p29">Techmeme</a> leads with the WSJ story.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Because we need to continue to accelerate how we capture growth opportunities, we are taking a series of actions such as reducing management layers, prioritizing R&amp;D investments and a workforce reduction affecting about 4,000 employees, or 5 percent of our workforce."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23862152/cisco-systems-reports-increased-sales-and-profit">Mercury News</a> has a history of Cisco layoffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 4,000 job cuts that Cisco Systems announced Wednesday are the latest in several major staff reductions by the San Jose networking company. Others include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>July 2012: 1,300 jobs, about 2 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>July 2011: 6,500 jobs, 4,400 through layoffs and 2,100 through early retirement packages, representing 9 percent of its global workforce</li>
  <li>February 2009: 2,000 jobs out of a workforce of 66,560</li>
  <li>April 2001: 8,500 jobs, including 6,000 full-time employees and 2,500 contractors</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more than 5,000 members on LinkedIn of the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=832&amp;mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah">Cisco Alumni Association</a>; if you are laid off in this round or if you had previously left Cisco, you are welcome to join.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ten years ago, the power went out.</p>

<p>It's not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it's just you or if it's happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called <a href="http://forkestra.com/">Dave Langhorst</a>, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/power_outage.html">2003 blackout</a> here on Vacuum, and the day after, I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2003/08/network_down_re.html">asked if people had good fiction</a> to share about end-of-the-world scenarios that involved not fire or ice but network downtime. E. M. Forster's <a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html">The Machine Stops</a> was the universal recommendation; I recommend it to you as well as a short story from more than 100 years ago about the death of the net as we know it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a feeling that I'm going to be doing a lot more writing using the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown
is <a href="http://help.typepad.com/using_markdown.html">supported by Typepad</a>, <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">supported by Octopress</a> (with a bunch of enhancements), <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">supported by Github</a> (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), <a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown">supported by Vim</a> (with colorizing of text),
and <a href="https://leanpub.com/help/manual">supported by Leanpub</a> (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files). That's five
for five for the environments I'm working in the most, which suggests that it's
worthwhile to learn all that I can.</p>

<p>Markdown is a fairly simple language, and it's relatively old in net terms (2004)
so it's had time to mature. Maturing means both that there are well-documented
core features that are invariant among all Markdown interpreters, as well as 
sometimes incompatible details that show up when people extend the system.</p>

<p>Some popular interpreters include:</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-12-taking-inventory-of-old-github-projects/">Taking inventory of old Github projects</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Setting up <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has given me a chance to look through some of
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti">my old Github repositories</a> and re-assess what's there and how to 
improve on them. </p>

<p>This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it
reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a
github account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/aadl-amazon-linky">aadl-amazon-linky</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">superpatron</a>. Both of these are interfaces
to the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> catalog, which has a very accessible
programming interface with things like RSS feeds for catalog searches.
I'd like to go back and revisit two parts of this. One was a Greasemonkey
plugin to put library results in Amazon; that should be a Chrome plugin.
The second was a "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/79567788/">wall of books</a>" report displaying an RSS query as a
page full of book cover images. Of the two, the second looks easiest to
recreate; I just checked in some new code, <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/superpatron/blob/master/tools/wall-by-keyword.sh">wall by keyword</a>, which does
the trick.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools">vielmetti-shelltools</a>. This is a small collection of shell scripts
that I carry around with me and put on whatever system I happen to be
working on. It would be worthwhile to go back through and compare
what I used then with what I use now and refresh the collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">postcard</a>. This was a hopeful project to use various web-to-postcard
APIs to generate custom postcards on the fly from the command line. Alas,
several of those APIs have disappeared. The real action in this market is
sending a real postcard from your iPhone or Android phone, with products
like <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a> leading the way. The other neat feature is to go to a drugstore
and make an instant print, then stick a stamp on the back and mail it.
(<a href="http://communitynetworking2008.wordpress.com/">Steve Cisler</a> taught me that trick.)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter-mutual-friends</a>. Once upon a time, the Twitter API was so
simple that you could write a useful application in four lines of shell
script. Now the API has improved itself, and it's gotten a lot more 
complicated. Look at simple apps like <a href="https://github.com/gianu/latest_tweets">latest_tweets</a> by gianu to
get an idea of what you're up against now.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">mobile</a>. Again, once upon a time, I had a Blackberry phone which
had the world's worst usable web browser. Fortunately there were enough
web sites that had a minimalist presentation that I was able to put
together a directory of workable sites, which I used for quite a while.
Now I have an Android phone that runs Chrome as well as apps and I don't
need the list of sites quite so much; still, it's worthwhile to have
a place to collect them when I find them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So when it's time to write some code here are some ideas for where
to start again!</p>

An early 1990&#39;s, I believe a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corsica" target="_self">Chevrolet Corsica</a>, tan/gold in color, made an illegal right turn from the far left lane in front of our motorcycle. The vehicle stopped briefly in the intersection after causing us to dump our bike, but quickly left after the Ypsi Fire Dept came on the scene. </p>
<p>I know that the first two pedestrians who spoke with us witnessed the accident, and appeared to be taking pictures/video of the scene. A third pedestrian, wearing a pink t-shirt, helped get our bike off of us and handed me my partners glasses. I&#39;m sure he also witnessed the incident, and saw the vehicle leave the scene. </p>
<p>If you, or anyone you&#39;ve spoke to had told you about this accident, or have pics/video if the incident, please contact me through this post. It can be done anonymously, we are looking for the driver of the vehicle who left the scene. Also, I&#39;d like to thank the pedestrians, Ypsi firefighters, the fine paramedics of HVA, and Officer Thompson of Ypsi PD for all your help.

      <p>I am using Octopress to build a new web site at <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io">http://vielmetti.github.io</a>. This looks like it will be a good place as any to write about code and any github projects I am working on. I will keep writing about everything else here.</p>

<p>To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown. Then you use a command line tool called 'rake', the Ruby version of 'make', to do the publishing. Files that have changed get checked in to github. Then the whole site is put into static files, so that it all loads fast.</p>

<p>Amazing how much more time you have for hacking when you are not on Facebook.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Several reasons why I am removing the Facebook from my phone.</p>

<p>Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</p>

<p>Facebook's ads are increasingly intrusive. It is easier to cope with the ads on Twitter.</p>

<p>It is easy to switch identity on the Twitter client so if I temporarily need to take the voice of Arborwiki or of Heikki Lunta it is easy. With Facebook I am expected to be me all the time.</p>

<p>The mobile Android Facebook client is bad at reminders of birthdays, so to do that I need to go to the desktop client anyways.</p>

<p>Time on Facebook generally is time away from blogging. True, the blog has fewer readers and less comments then an equal post on Facebook, but I am not writing this strictly to chase feedback.</p>

<p>It is always worthwhile to experiment with change, especially since it would be easy to change back.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out <a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997">from the Ann Arbor District Library.</a></p>

<p>Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</p>

<p>Grant likes givers, but recognizes that sometimes people give too much and never manage to get things in return. These selfless people tend to burn out when too many things go opposite to their interests. He opens up the opportunity to recognize a newly coined word "otherish" - an opposite of selfish where you consider both your interests and the others interests simultaneously. "Otherish" people are looking for win-win situations, as opposed to selfless people who end up in win-lose setups.</p>

<p>"Givers are overrepresented at the top, as well as at the bottom, of most success measures." </p>

<p>An <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/printer_friendly.cfm?articleid=3224">interview with Adam Grant</a> about the book is a 25 minute version which touches on several more high points of the book.</p>

      <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. That candidate who will go unnamed was said to have been very upset about losing, and their supporters were said to have been rude to the press and to other politicos present. I wasn't there to witness it myself.</p>

Here&#39;s a few notes. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/ann-arbor-planning-commission-denies-rezoning-for-duplex-on-packard/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com story about the meeting</a> and a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/08/07/rezoning-request-denied-for-3325-packard/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes. By a unanimous vote, the Planning Commission turned down the request, stating in the discussion both that the master plan envisioned single-family homes in that area and that they were not in the habit of doing &quot;spot zoning&quot; to change a single parcel. The petitioner was encouraged to consult with neighbors to see if an entire block front could be upzoned which would be more likely - though by no means guaranteed - to get approval.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of public commentary on this public hearing came from a neighbor, who did not express an opinion about the zoning request but did request that the property owners trim their trees, which are extending over to her roof.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that has duplexes, and I have to say that they are perfectly in character in a mix of housing that includes single-family houses next door. Indeed, I can&#39;t imagine a neighborhood situation where a duplex would be out of character anywhere in Ann Arbor, especially given modern duplex designs that look like single-family homes. It&#39;s not atypical that on my block a neighbor lives in a home that was built as a single family home, was duplexed in the 1940s, and was unduplexed when she bought it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also not sure that the master planning for the area in question makes any sense. Packard is an extraordinary busy street near Platt, and five lanes of traffic means that any single family home is going to be particularly attractive to a buyer. The part of Packard that I leave near is upzoned along quite a length, allowing for a mix of rental properties, small apartment buildings, offices and retail. It&#39;s a good mix, and makes for a more interesting place to live. I&#39;d think that even if the area in question stayed residential that it would be sensible to allow more density along Packard - not necessarily a 13 story high rise, but other dense residential or small-scale commerical or office property that characterizes the rest of the Packard corridor.</p>
<p>The zoning map below shows the parcel - it&#39;s one of the ten residential lots on the north size of Packard, with commerical and apartment buildings across the street and offices and retail on the same side to the west.</p>
