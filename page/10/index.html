<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments as presented to the Ann Arbor City Council for the September 2, 2014 meeting.</p>

<p>Four very brief topics: municipal maps, public records, closed captioning and the city web site. These are my intended comments at the end of the meeting.</p>

<p>Regarding municipal maps, I would point out that any of the maps generated by the city in your packet have a very strict copyright on them prohibiting redistribution without the express written consent of the city. This is but one of several easily addressable flaws in the city mapping project.</p>

<p>Regarding public records, the current system of Legistar for publication of attachments to the agenda is very difficult in that it is impossible to search through the full text of attached items. Some municipal data activists in other cities have taken to wholesale downloading of the entire site to get around the problems with access.</p>

<p>Regarding closed captioning, it is my understanding that the Disability Commission is going to have closed captioning of its meetings, and I urge you to direct the city administrator to direct CTN to provide closed captioning of City Council meetings.</p>

<p>Finally regarding the city web site. It is more of a thing of beauty than the previous version, but in the process several hundreds of pages have gone missing, either by renaming of previous URLs or removal of content, and I urge you to take action to remedy these failings.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>Of the many facets of the criminal world, few have captured society’s fascination as 
has that of high stakes robbery. The combination of meticulousness, cunning, and 
audacity required to execute a real-life Ocean’s Eleven may be uncommon among 
criminals, but fortunately it is common enough to extract a wealth of lessons for the 
protection of high-value assets. To assist in informing the analyses and decisions of 
security professionals, this paper surveys 23 sophisticated and high-value heists that 
have occurred or been attempted around the world, particularly over the past three 
decades. The results, compiled in a Heist Methods and Characteristics Database, 
have been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, with the goals of both identifying 
common characteristics and characterizing the range and diversity of criminal 
methods used. The analysis is focused in six areas: (1) Defeated Security Measures 
and Devices, (2) Deception Methods, (3) Timing, (4) Weapons, (5) Resources, and 
(6) Insiders.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have written about here previously about Stanford researcher BJ Fogg in the context of his "Tiny Habits" project. He has a talk here from 2012 about the "motivation wave" and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low. The challenge is to get people to do things when they are motivated that allow them to expand their capacity to be on task when they are not motivated, e.g. by making it possible for them to get small and easy wins and tiny successes when their personal motivation is at a low ebb. </p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-08-28-building-a-marquette-localwiki/">Building a Marquette Localwiki</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I visit Marquette Michigan every summer to see family and catch up with friends and visit the place I went to high school. Every so often there's a reunion, but often it's just a matter of going back to the home town and figuring out what's up and what's what.</p>

<p>Since I've been working on Arborwiki for the better part of eight years, I thought last year that I'd give a try to make a <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi">Localwiki for Marquette</a>. Technologically it was easy to do - Localwiki makes adding new regions easy - but practically it's got some challenges. Here are notes on what it means to look at Localwiki for a rural area.</p>

<p>The first most obvious thing to note is that there often are places and locations that don't have a currently updated home page. If you want to document the area, you have to attach a lot of things to its history, and the places like closed mines, abandoned railroads, long-gone restaurants, shuttered gas stations, and the like have to be created from scratch and not simply replicated from existing content. This is typical of the history portion of any Localwiki effort, in that local histories of otherwise not notable enough for Wikipedia things demand a combination of original research and local knowledge. The page I started for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Red_Road">Red Road</a> is one example of this.</p>

<p>When you're doing a map of areas that are relatively rural, you find that the default street map used by Localwiki isn't that interesting. As much as I know it's difficult to do, I wish the system had easier ways of integrating other map sources into the effort. Street maps are really the wrong tool when you're looking at areas that are mostly woods; you'd like a topo map, maybe, and a plat map that showed land ownership, and a geological surface map that gave some hint what the land looked like and a forest map that showed which lands were in commercial forest. None of these are likely to show up in Google Maps any time soon.</p>

<p>Trails and non-motorized pathways are a big opportunity for Localwiki. My mom is working on a project for signage for the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Iron_Ore_Heritage_Trail">Iron Ore Heritage Trail</a>, and I've put the bug in her ear that it might be interesting to cross-link somehow the interpretive signs on the trail with the corresponding Localwiki pages. Even getting good photography and mapping of trail heads would be a big enough project that I can imagine spending a week scouting out locations and not being done.</p>

<p>There's a concern at the Wikipedia project that linking to Localwiki pages is somehow dicey because of advertising on Localwiki, or perhaps because not enough people on Wikipedia are familiar enough with Localwiki to know what to expect when they see a page. As a contrast, there are also concerns on a Facebook group I follow about "wikishit" when people see a years-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marquette_Monster&amp;oldid=622698099">Marquette Monster</a> page that was completely fabricated.</p>

<p>I'll look for more ways to get more reliable information into the Marquette Localwiki. I'm particularly happy with the start that the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Gazetteer">Gazetteer</a> page has for listing location, and there's some long amount of work to give the <a href="http://localwiki.net/marquettemi/Mines">Mines</a> page its due to document the mining history of the area. I'm not sure the system has a single goal, but I'm always happy when other people pick up on it, add their piece, and make it useful to themselves.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The St Louis, Missouri Localwiki - <a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis">http://localwiki.net/st-louis</a> - was mostly empty when the events in Ferguson, MO started on August 9, 2014 with the death of 18 year old student Michael Brown. As with any event where there's a lot that's going on in an unfamiliar area, I was drawn to making some sense of what was happening. This has been especially true when the coverage on the #<a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/ferguson">ferguson</a> hashtag overwhelmed my Twitter feed, which had been usually quiet at night.</p>

<p>The Localwiki crew - including Jason Denizac, Marina Kukso, Philip Neustrom, James Halliday, and others have been super helpful in filling in the blanks on the Localwiki map around Ferguson. It's been helpful to get one step away from the relentless outsider media scrum and read background pieces by local journalists from places like the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/Riverfront_Times">Riverfront Times</a>, the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/St._Louis_American">St. Louis American</a>, and the 
<a href="http://localwiki.net/st-louis/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. </p>

<p>Writing and editing a localwiki has been a helpful way for me to process some of the difficult things that have gone on. It turns a helpless feeling into some sort of community engagement. I am conscious that I'm not always going to be engaged in this effort at the level that I am now, so there's some extra care not to leave too many loose ends in the process. As of this writing (August 21, 2014) there are about 150 pages in the St. Louis Localwiki, which is just barely a start.</p>

<p>Ideally someone local to the scene would eventually happen upon the localwiki and find it useful, or someone who was comfortable in the localwiki space would move to the area and be drawn to it as a way to document their surroundings. To some extent I feel like as much of an outside tourist as the news media that parachuted into the area to cover events; yet it doesn't really feel that way so much. Time will tell.</p>

      <p>The 6 year run of the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> is coming to a close. The end date will be Septmeber 2, 2014, which happens to be an Ann Arbor City Council night as well.</p>

<p>The Chronicle was noted for its relentless and exhausting coverage of civic meetings. You could get the feeling that you too had sat on the hard benches for hours as you read through a 15,000 word account of what transpired. Hey, you could even read 6,000 words from time to time about meetings that never got a quorum.</p>

<p>I'll miss the Chronicle, which was one beacon of honest (if quirky) journalism in a town that hasn't always had a newspaper that I've looked forward to reading. It will become just a little harder to keep up with municipal government, and more people in government will get a free pass because they don't have a critical eye focused on what they do. I completely understand that six years of two people's lives is a lot to give for the cause of local journalism, and I wish Dave and Mary the best.</p>

<blockquote>
Note: The annual Bezonki award festivities will still take place – on Friday, Aug. 15  – and you’re invited. The open house will run from 6-8 p.m. at Zingerman’s Events on Fourth in Kerrytown. There will be teeter-tottering and general merriment. Publisher Mary Morgan will follow up with a final word on Sept. 2, after the city council meeting ends. That will be our final report filed from the hard benches of city hall.

      </h3>
      <p>Avoid the long lines and sit down quickly with these tips at Zingerman's Deli.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the bread counter in the deli. After you taste the samples, get a bagel. Ask them to slice it. (Or ask for one of their yummy bialys which I did last time I was there.)</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to the deli counter or the fish counter, if you're hungry for same. Ask for something you'd like to put on that bagel.</p></li>
<li><p>Go ahead to the head of the line! You don't need to wait for the long lines at the sandwich ordering counter. If you want something to drink, you can get it at checkout. Assemble the sandwich yourself when you get to your seat.</p></li>
<li><p>Interested in a more substantial sandwich? You can get premade sandwiches that are delicious (but smaller than the big Zingerman's sandwiches) at Zingerman's Next Door.</p></li>
<li><p>Call ahead! You can phone in your order ahead of time and have it ready when you get there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's not really a secret menu, but it does let you walk in, grab something delicious, and go sit down and take in the scene. It also lets you get through the line in only a few minutes.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm looking into getting an Acer C720 Chromebook as a next computer.</p>

<p>Shopping sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/devices/acer-c720-chromebook.html#ac-c720">Google</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00FNPD1VW/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=new">via Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834314360">Newegg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Prices vary; I had seen less than $175, but now (late July 2014) it's running about $200. </p>

<p>Of particular interest is the ability of this system to run Linux. Your choices are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a></li>
<li><a href="http://chrubuntu.blogspot.ca/">Chrubuntu</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of especially particular interest is Minecraft on a Chromebook. Here's a <A href="http://doctor-not-magician.blogspot.com/2014/01/minecraft-on-acer-c720-chromebook.html">walk through of Minecraft on an Acer C720 with Crouton</a>, which reports that "[f]ull screen with all the graphical options turned up to full, you should see around 35 frames per second rising to 50 when all the chunks have loaded."</p>

      <p>This map from <a href="http://lightningmaps.org">LightningMaps.ORG</a> shows lightning over Lake Michigan and into Ottawa County, Michigan at about 11:15 p.m on 22 July 2014. Note the strong line of storms crossing the lake.</p>

<p>The corresponding power outage map is from <a href="http://www.consumersenergy.com/outagemap">Consumers Energy</a>. Outage reporting generally lags behind realtime by 15-30 minutes, and of course not every lightning strike turns into a power problem (though sometimes it seems like it does).</p>

<p>It appears that the SKYWARN repeater's internet feed (147.060 K8DAA repeater, owned by the <a href="http://www.hollandarc.org/">Holland Amateur Radio Club</a> in Holland, Michigan) is offline.

      <p>In Michigan, February is 13 months long. That's why I'm thinking of simulated sunrise applications that turn a pleasant light on slowly to mimic the sunrise. I don't need this in July, but I will need it come February.</p>

<p>If you've tried one of these things let me know, I'll fill in the blank space here with more information as I get it.</p>
