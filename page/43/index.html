<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-31-recipe-coconut-potato-curry/">Recipe: Coconut-potato curry</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens, and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.</p>
<p>Coconut-potato curry.</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>curry powder, to taste</li>
<li>1 can coconut milk</li>
<li>2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done. Reserve some cooking water.</p>
<p>While the potatoes are boiling, fry a chopped onion in some oil on low heat. When the onion smells nice but is not brown, add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant.</p>
<p>Add the coconut milk to the curry mixture and stir until well mixed. Then add the garbanzoes, and cook covered on low heat.</p>
<p>When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garbanzo curry. Cut the potatoes into smaller pieces if they are too large. Keep covered, and add up to 1 cup potato water if the mixture gets too dry.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-30-tressel-dead-schembechlers/">Bo Biafra: &#34;the invisible paw of the International Wolverine Conspiracy has taken down Tressel&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2011/05/30/ohio-state-news.html?sid=101">Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning</a> that <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Jim_Tressel">Jim Tressel</a> has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/magazine/05/30/jim.tressel/index.html">Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&#39;s leadership of the program</a>, culminating in an NCAA investigation.</p>
<p>For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the <a href="http://www.deadschembechlers.com/">Dead Schembechlers</a>. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&#39;s best to have a &quot;holy rivalry&quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &quot;New Wolverine Order&quot;, the &quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&quot;, or the &quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entrapment of Tressel a fait accompli as soon as Dead Schembechlers drove out Rich &#39;The Weasel&#39; Rodriguez. We promise massive retaliation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that I bring you their hit &quot;Rodriguez Is A Weasel&quot;.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-29-severe-weather/">What do you tune into during severe weather?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I get all the news I need from the weather report. Here&#39;s where I get the weather report from.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong>, to chat with people who are also in their basements. The local hash tag is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23miwx" target="_self">#miwx</a> for severe weather. I have a list <a href="http://twitter.com/vielmetti/weather" target="_self">@vielmetti/weather</a> that I follow for the news.</p>
<p><a href="http://wunderground.com" target="_self">Weather Underground</a> for radar and forecasts and what not. I like the <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com" target="_self">classic version of the user interface</a>, which is busy and deep and which I know well enough to navigate. The <a href="http://m.wund.com/" target="_self">minimalist mobile version of the site</a>&#0160;is starkly unbusy and works fine even on a relatively dumb smart phone. &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>SKYWARN</strong>, the local ham radio emergency weather channel. The local repeater is&#0160;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/N8DUY" target="_self">N8DUY</a>, located near I-94 and M-14 in Scio Township, available at&#0160;145.150&#0160;Mhz or via the&#0160;<a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?action=wp&amp;feedId=5230" target="_self">Radio Reference relay online</a>. This is the single best source of real time news during events.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dteenergy.com/map/outage.html" target="_self">DTE Energy outage map</a>&#0160;is good for tracking storm damage starting about 30 minutes after the storm has gone through - you start to pick up which power outages will take a long time to fix. Note in this map below from Sunday, May 29, 2011, that the storm damage near Lansing ends at the DTE boundary; that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t more storm damage, only that I don&#39;t have a map of the other.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef014e88c2d284970d-pi"><img alt="Picture 22" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef014e88c2d284970d" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef014e88c2d284970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 22" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Television</strong>, which we don&#39;t have for over the air reception. WDIV Channel 4 &quot;Click On Detroit&quot; has useful email weather alerts and a <a href="http://detroit.justweather.com/" target="_self">Detroit JustWeather</a> page, and WXYZ Channel 7&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23backchannel" target="_self">#backchannel</a> on Twitter always has good chatter from the news desk there.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>AM/FM radio</strong>. Locally the best bet is <a href="http://weather.detroit.cbslocal.com/auto/wwjtvV4/MI/Detroit.html" target="_self">WWJ &quot;News radio 950</a>&quot;, with traffic and weather together on the 8&#39;s; it&#39;s intended to be listened to while you are driving, and they do talk</p>
<p><strong>Weather band radio, </strong>which speaks in a synthesized scary voice. There are receivers that only turn on when there is an alert in your area, but I don&#39;t have one. <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/wxradio.php" target="_self">Details from National Weather Service Detroit</a> about the network of weather radios in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Weather facsimile</strong>. Again, never have managed to do this, but if you have the right radio you can decode faxes with weather maps on the that are broadcast over the air. Also known as WEFAX, the technology dates from the 1920s. Details if you are good at such things from <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/radiofax.htm">National Weather Service marine forecast services</a>.</p>
<p>You should be able to get real time notifications of severe weather even if you have no power, no cell tower, and no Internet; that&#39;s why you have batteries for your radio.</p>

<blockquote>
Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson.  Written after Scott-Heron had recorded "I'm New Here" but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.

<p>It was around the middle seventies when I first heard this brazen, young black man's voice. He was angry! We were angry! I was angry! Angry over the fact that it was a few years ago that they had just taken from us our black shining Prince. He was mad. We were mad. I was mad! Mad over the fact that our struggle for freedom had come to a screeching halt. He was loud! Loud and determined to be heard. And I heard him. I heard him loud and clear. I heard him when he said "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised". I heard him when he said "No Knock On My Brothers' Head". I heard him when he was saying that the spirit of Brother Malcolm will flourish in him as it has in me.</p>

<p>The image shows storm-to-date stormwater related incidents in Ann Arbor and the surrounding area - I will leave it to the world to decide how far away &quot;surrounding&quot; is, but certainly the Huron River watershed is in scope, and I suspect that the area to watch is roughly the size of the <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> catchment basin.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Lightning hit a brick chimney at Ann Arbor&#39;s Northside Elementary School on Wednesday at about 4:15 p.m., sending bricks flying 100 feet through the school pickup area. Fortunately, no one was hurt, as the area was vacant except for a staff member&#39;s vehicle which was damaged by flying brick.</p>
<p>I was aware of this when it happened because the lightning strike was powerful enough to cause the power grid to bounce, prompting <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/billmerrill/status/73488487357218817" target="_self">comments on Twitter and speculating on the exact location</a>.

      </h3>
      <p><p>The river is high. Will it flood? That&#39;s a very good question to ask in the morning before a storm; and the answer today turned out to be yes. Roads were inundated, Lake Barracuda emerged from its stormwater geyser, Depot Street filled with water, Mullholland Creek popped a manhole cover, and S. Main Street near Michigan Stadium filled. West Park&#39;s new water features get a workout.</p>
<p>Basements have taken on water, and the full extent of storm damage is unknown yet until we get the May 26 predicted rains.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for data, you&#39;ll find the specific current and recent historical information from these sources.</p>
<p>The USGS &#0160;<a href="http://water.usgs.gov/data/" target="_self">Water Data Discovery page</a> describes the <a href="http://water.usgs.gov" target="_self">National Water Information System</a>&#0160;which has reat time, predictive, and historical data for use.</p>
<p>USGS National Water Information System real-time water data for gauges in the area is measured every 15 minutes and reported with 60-90 minutes delay. Look at the gauges for the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mi/nwis/uv?site_no=04174500" target="_self">Huron River at Ann Arbor</a>, and you&#39;ll see a graph showing current levels. It&#39;s also possible to go back and get the data as data going back as far as 120 days, and to retrieve prior years data on a daily basis.&#0160;</p>
<p>There is also a gauge on Allen Creek which has collected data from some storms, but which is not in the National Water Information System and not always online. Allen Creek empties into the Huron River just downstream of Argo Dam, and at peak flow it can dump at least 1500 cubic feet per second into the river. I have seen data from one storm, and it looks like this can turn into 600 cubic feet per second at the next gauge, though that&#39;s only one data point.</p>
<p>You can look yourself at the tabular data for the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/data/exsa_rat/04174500.rdb">river rating of the Huron River at Wall Street</a>, which shows a level by level matching of flow vs water height. If the river is very low (300 cfs), then a sudden burst of 600 cfs will raise the level of the river by about a foot, and a burst of 1500 cfs will raise the level of the river by about two feet.</p>
<p>River forecasts come out routinely between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and if needed a second forecast goes out between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., according to National Weather Service meteorologist <strong>Danny Costello</strong>.&#0160;</p>
<p>For more media information about products provided by the NWS, here&#39;s a slide deck I found on the Grand Rapids NOAA site as a media briefing. It explains in one of the slides a key aspect of predictions: the weather service changes from &quot;watch&quot; to &quot;warning&quot; when a forecast probability goes up to 80% likelihood of the event occurring.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act requires 18 hours advance notice of special meetings, and even less time (though I am not clear how much less time) for special meetings of committees. Thus, if you were not on a mailing list (with a relatively small number of people on the list), you did not receive notice directly of this meeting which is needed to resolve the <a href="http://a2gov.org" target="_self">City of Ann Arbor</a> and the <a href="http://a2dda.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority</a>&#39;s mutual disagreements over the city budget.</p>
<p>I follow this primarily through the exhaustively detailed reporting of my <a href="http://workantileexchange.com" target="_self">current coworking group</a> member <strong>Dave Askins</strong> at the <a href="http://annarborchroncile.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>, the timely reporting of my former coworker <strong>Ryan Stanton</strong> at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/AnnArbor.com" target="_self">AnnArbor.com</a>, and the new news beat that my former coworker <strong>James Dickson</strong> is carving out at the <a href="http://a2journal.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor Journal</a>, and the editorial direction that home town friend <strong>John Hilton</strong>&#0160;directs at the monthly <a href="http://annarborobserver.com/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Observer</a>.</p>
<p>From time to time, the autonomous collective of <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/" target="_self">Damn Arbor</a> pitches in, with <strong>Ben Connor Barrie</strong> most likely to be the townie and grad student voice of civic news gathering. That weblog is in the tradition of previous efforts, notably <strong>Rob Goodspeed</strong>&#39;s <a href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/20050716/Cat-AnnArbor.htm" target="_self">Goodspeed Update</a>, the autonomous collective and voice of <strong>Julie Weatherbee</strong> at&#0160;<a href="http://arborupdate.com" target="_self">Arbor Update</a>, and a long-anonymous <strong>Julia Lipman</strong> at&#0160;<a href="http://annarborisoverrated.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor is Overrated</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>This is all shorthand to say that I hope you are going to this meeting, if you care about it, and that if you care enough about it to want to know that it exists without me telling you about it you have to ask to be informed in advance.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Two years ago, the state of the art in local news aggregation was outside.in. That site aggregated postings about a specific geographical area and offered up a web based user interface to republish those links on your web site. Outside.in did not have its own staff of reporters, and its automated systems for newsgathering were (to be charitable) fallible, and thus it sometimes threw up junk of various kinds which was unpleasant to wade through.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, or more specifically March 2011, where AOL&#39;s <a href="http://www.patch.com" target="_self">Patch</a> buys outside.in, a deal <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/04/aol-outside-in/" target="_self">reported by Techcrunch</a> to be worth south of $10 million.&#0160;</p>
<p>Patch&#39;s world model is of a world full of part time news gatherers publishing local news about locations which are small towns. In the local area, there&#39;s a <a href="http://dexter.patch.com/" target="_self">Dexter Patch</a>, a <a href="http://saline-milan.patch.com/" target="_self">Saline/Milan Patch</a>, a <a href="http://plymouth-mi.patch.com/" target="_self">Plymouth Patch</a> but no Ann Arbor Patch and no Ypsilanti Patch. &#0160;How do you get full-scope news coverage for every zip code, then? By reworking your outside.in feed structure as &quot;Local news powered by Patch&quot;, and suddenly you can push links out to a network of systems that are happy to put local news on the local weather page and don&#39;t much care about the details except that there needs to be a plausible result for every single zip code.</p>

<p>Rarely does anything here reach the form of art that gets thousands of words to tell a story, at least not all at once. To do that properly you need an editor who not only makes sure that the cleanup gets done on the words but keeps you on track for the long process of telling a story start to finish.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-23-public-meetings/">On knowing about more public meetings than you possibly could attend</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s an overly simplified description of the process by which you can learn about, and participate in, more public meetings on more topics of public interest than you could possibly attend in person - without ever relying on someone else&#39;s account of what transpired at that meeting.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Identify the <strong>public body</strong> which has oversight or jurisdiction over the issue in question. There may be multiples of these, at the local, county, state and federal levels, plus occasionally a treaty organization or two that gets involved.</p>
<p>Identify the <strong>governing board</strong> of the body, and the individual members of the board. Your direct questions about agenda items will go to them.</p>
<p>Identify the staff member who is <strong>board secretary</strong>. They are your best contact for details like board minutes and notices of upcoming meetings.</p>
<p>Ask the board secretary that you be <strong>notified of upcoming board events</strong>, per the Open Meetings Act. Put any future dates on your calendar. Note that meeting times can change on short notice.</p>
<p>Ask for copies of <strong>board packets</strong> for upcoming board events, per the Freedom of Information Act, and probably because it&#39;s as easy as cc&#39;ing you on an existing email list.</p>
<p>Determine if there are <strong>audio and video recordings of board meetings</strong>, and if they are streamed live online. Ask for details about access.</p>
<p>Identify a member of the public whose affairs are affected by the public body who needs <strong>assistive technology</strong> to participate in meetings, and work on their behalf to gain access to meeting materials in machine-readable formats.</p>
<p><strong>Read minutes of past meetings</strong>. If those minutes are not online, request of the board secretary that copies be put online. Note that in most cases draft copies of meeting minutes should be available before they are approved at the next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Read agendas of upcoming meetings</strong>. In some cases, detailed agendas will be available, complete with supporting records which are intended to to help the board members make decisions. Ask the board secretary for information about any details which are not obvious from the published agenda. Note that agendas can change on short notice.</p>
<p>Contact <strong>individual board members in private </strong>regarding items on current and future agendas. If you are brief, concise, and narrowly focused, you can provide them with assistance in their work in upcoming meetings.</p>
<p>Contact <strong>the board as a whole in public</strong> to make a public statement about a topic. Note that although I leave this at the very end, this is what most people think about when they go to public meetings - standing up, all shaky, in front of a microphone and giving their opinion. By the time you have gotten to the mike, it&#39;s always best that your message (however popular or unpopular) is at the very least not a surprise.</p>

Meetings are held the first and third Monday nights of the month starting at 7:00 p.m., unless they aren&#39;t for some reason like a holiday. There is a meeting today, May 23, 2011, which is a continuation of budget-related issues that were left unresolved at the May 16, 2011 meeting.</p>

<p>NOTE: Agendas can and do change up until the last moment, and it&#39;s impossible to know ahead of time whether your topic of burning interest will be addressed at any given meeting. Watching online, and ensuring that you have a person who is tracking your issue close enough to city hall to get to council chambers, can be an alternative to sitting in the pews every other Monday.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-22-about-/">About ...</a>
      </h3>
      <p>This is the weblog of Edward Vielmetti in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It&#39;s part of a continuous stream of writing online that started for the Internet in 1985, and that showed up here on Typepad in 2003 or so.</p>
<p>I have been interested in a great many things, which all have had something to do one way or the other with networks and internetworks at all levels - technical, political, social, biological, intellectual and commercial. Often, the only way to make sense of something is to write about it, and the log reflects that continuous stream of curiousity much more so than any desire to &quot;publish&quot;.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of this writing has been about Ann Arbor, and for a year and a half<a href="http://annarbor.com/vielmetti" target="_self"> I wrote a daily column for &#0160;AnnArbor.com that was published online</a>. That was a fascinating job, and it&#39;s over; I&#39;m currently seeking a new full-time position. <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/edwardvielmetti" target="_self">You can see my online resume on LinkedIn</a>, which makes some approximation of what a career in the Internet looks like.&#0160;</p>
<p>I took this weblog offline for a few months in early 2011 so that I could read through enough of it to do an edit on some of the categorization, add back in some old materials that deserved to be preserved, and unpublish a handful of mostly unread works that needed further editing. The editing job is woefully lacking in most blogging, and the opportunity to go offline for a bit and do a cleanup job is quite welcomed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here&#39;s what some people have written about recently in their writings about the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, especially looking at produce that&#39;s at market, new vendors and old, how people are doing and checking the weather.</p>
<p>The one constant is that everyone seems to have gotten a lot of rain. Here&#39;s a map of the last 7 days of precipitation.</p>

<p>Eggs: Grandma from Grandma&#39;s Kitchen brought 137 dozen eggs. Her tractor is still in the mud up to its axles.</p>
<p>Rhubarb: $3.50 for about 1.5 # from Wasem&#39;s Fruit Farm. Cynthia from Mother&#39;s Kitchen has this recipe for&#0160;<a href="http://motherskitchen.blogspot.com/2011/05/stewed-rhubarb.html" target="_self">Stewed Rhubarb</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need any miracles today.&#0160;&#0160; And if you are new to canning, you won&#39;t need any miracles either&#0160;if give rhubarb a try.&#0160; Canning stewed rhubarb is ridiculously simple - all you need is rhubarb and sugar.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greens: It was the week for a bag of braising greens, knowing full well that greens needed to stay in the fridge a day or two before being eaten and thus the spinach was a bad choice.</p>
<p>Chocolate: Paul from <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Mindo_Chocolates" target="_self">Mindo Chocolates</a>&#0160;was there sampling some amazing freshly roasted chocolate. &#0160;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making a point when I visit the school to pick up or drop off J. to make a pass past the lost and found and put anything on a hanger that could possibly go onto a hanger. It&rsquo;s impossible to know if that makes an immediate difference, but it&rsquo;s satisfying to find a 5 minute volunteer opportunity that I can see.</p>
