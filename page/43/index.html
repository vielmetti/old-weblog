<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?</p>

<p>There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. The VC in turn provides value by vetting the value of the allegedly valuable trade secret and is prepared to say "that's not a secret, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Paul Baran started a company doing that in 1985</a>".</p>

<p>A crafty tradesman is perpetually disclosing some relevant fragments of their trade knowledge at all times, in part to demonstrate competence, and in part to test whether what they know is really true.</p>

<p>As far as disclosure of trade secrets goes, I'd be much more worried about details leaking out inadvertently via ill-considered partners and subcontractors than via an investor.</p>

      <p>THIS WEEK IN MAPS, for Sunday, October 30, 2011: A late October snowstorm is heading up the East Coast of the United States for Halloween. Here's maps of the affected areas, showing what parts of the electrical grid have had the worst impact from the heavy, wet snow in the forecast.</p>

<h2>New Hampshire</h2>

<p>As of 2:00 a.m. Sunday, 32% of PSNH customers are without power.</p>

      <blockquote>
  <p>We are writing to inform you that you have now been added to the beta for Google Analytics Real-Time! As we announced the Real-Time reports show you what is happening on your website as it happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once upon a time, there was <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a>. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.</p>

<p>Google now has a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real time version of Google Analytics</a>, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it. It tells you in real time what pages are being looked at, where people are coming from to look at them, and which keywords and referring sites are driving traffic. It scratches some of the same itch that mybloglog used to scratch, when there's some kind of burst of news and you want to know what's going on in real time and not on tomorrow's reporting.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a> had something that GA doesn't have and really hasn't had: tracking of clicks not to the site you're looking at, but to something out there in the world that you linked to.

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.</p>
<p>The organization announced its new web site, <a href="http://northburnspark.org" target="_self">northburnspark.org</a> , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</p>
<p>Residents expressed their concerns about municipal and neighborhood issues to each other and to several area elected officials who are residents of the neighborhood, including Mayor John Hieftje, Councilman Christopher Taylor, Washtenaw County commissioner Yousef Rabhi, and the recently appointed city administrator Steve Powers. (Does Steve live in the neighborhood?) (Links to names?)</p>
<p>Noise was a concern shared by several citizens, who expressed their frustration that nearby religious services, University functions, special events and construction activity generated noise far beyond ordinary noise limits yet were exempted by permits or the University&#39;s special relationship as an autonomous body. (Link to noise articles?) (mention Big House run by name?)</p>
<p>Mayor John Hieftje addressed citizen concerns regarding crime, noting that overall crime statistics as measured according to the FBI&#39;s standard reporting criteria are down across the board. Hieftje was critical of the media&#39;s portrayal of crime issues and perceptions of crime. It was noted (by whom?) that the increased awareness of near-campus crime was due in part to the University&#39;s direct dissemination of crime information and alerts. (Explain the Cleary Act? Link to municipal maps?)</p>
<p>Residents in North Burns Park (who, specifically?) expressed specific concerns about parking in near-campus apartments, noting that landlords have converted back yards into parking lots in excess of the city standard of 4 on-site spaces for a (which, specifically?) apartment unit.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Who? A couple of petanque enthusiasts) described the courts which they had helped in getting installed at the northeast corner of Burns Park (on some date) and invited neighbors to join in their enthusiasm for the game. Petanque is a French game similar to (boules) or bocce, played with metal balls on a gravel court. Students at Burns Park Elementary School learn petanque as part of their PE classes, and (the couple) are looking forward to a June 2012 event to raise money for ALS (as part of A2A3).</p>
<p>Long term residents were happy to see each other again at this annual meeting event, and new residents were welcomed. About (how many, 35?) were in attendance. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 pm and residents ate some but not all of the cider and cookies provided before walking home.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 7, 11:30 p.m. - A house near the corner of Harpst Street and Tremmell Avenue was on fire on the evening of October 7, 2011. This photo is provided courtesy of Mike Nowak (@<a href="http://twitter.com/snackdog" target="_self">snackdog</a>) and is used with permission.

According to apartment resident Amanda Szot, there was no fire in the complex, despite the substantial amount of smoke seen there.</p>
<p>Smoke from the fire could be smelled all the way to north to East Stadium at Westminster, and as far east as East Stadium at Packard.&#0160;</p>

<p><a href="http://chezpim.com/bake/quince-caramel" target="_self">Quince caramel</a> from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious.</p>
<blockquote>The fuzzy, fragrant fruits stared at me from the countertop for a couple of days. I thought I would poach them in simple syrup and keep in the fridge. The sweetened quince and the poaching syrup make a wonderful topping for my morning yogurt. The batch that my neighbor Beccy and I made a couple of weeks ago is running out, so this would be a good time to replenish. Then the real inspiration struck, caramel! I could use the sweet poaching liquid to make quince caramels, combining two of my favorite things to eat in the world, caramel and quince – I just love quince, I even love a restaurant named after it. How wonderful would that be?</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://migraineur.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/slow-food-chicken-tagine-with-quinces/" target="_self">Chicken tagine with quinces</a> comes via The Migraineur, quoting a recipe from Larousse for the preparation but spicing it with a traditional tagine.</p>
<blockquote>Still mindful of all those recipes calling for bucketloads of sugar, I was curious about how a raw quince would taste. While preparing the dish, I cut myself a very fine sliver and ate it. The texture was like an Asian pear, pleasingly granular, but a lot drier. Mostly I got that wonderful flowery fruity fragrance. Encouraged, I cut myself a larger chunk. Wow! Talk about pucker. It was like sucking on an inferior teabag – quinces are clearly loaded with tannins. So, no, I don’t think quinces can be eaten raw. However, I am encouraged by this recipe to think that quinces do not have to be sweetened.</blockquote>

      </h3>
      <p>Once upon a time it was del.icio.us, and it was the new cool way to use bookmarks and tagging, and I used it all the time. I put more than 10,000 bookmarks into the system. This was when Flickr was on the top of the world and before Facebook and Twitter had made much of a dent.</p>
<p>Del.icio.us turned into delicious.com, got bought by Yahoo. Some cool people started to work there supporting it. Yahoo gave it a loving embrace, and those cool people left to do other cool things. They warned me on their way out, and I moved <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:vielmetti" target="_self">my 10,000 bookmarks</a> to <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_self">pinboard</a> and mostly stopped using both systems because I wasn&#39;t ready to invest heavily in something that other people didn&#39;t trust.</p>
<p>Yahoo sold delicious.com to the founders of Youtube, who now run a company called AVOS. By all accounts the transition hasn&#39;t gone very well, e.g. your most loyal users say that the system has been <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/avos-delicious-disaster-lessons-from-a-complete-failure/705" target="_self">mangled by carpetbaggers</a>. From Violet Blue on ZDNet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahoo! got caught with its finger on the trigger to kill Delicious, an amazing cry came up from the internets to save it. Then AVOS rode in on a white unicorn to save it. Yay!</p>
<p>But, no. What we got was our worst fears about the bubble, confirmed.</p>
<p>Delicious is a bitter lesson for everyone. It’s the difference between how people actually use a product versus how rich, out-of-touch knuckleheads think people&#0160;<strong>should be</strong>&#0160;using that product, all to further their own self-interests.</p>
<p>If you make a startup we like, such as Delicious: please don’t sell it.</p>

I'm following @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/UARS_Reentry" target="_self">UARS_Reentry</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/NASA" target="_self">NASA</a> and that's enough to get the summary information.</p>
<p>Heavens Above has an <a href="http://www2.heavens-above.com/orbitdisplay.aspx?icon=default&width=300&height=300&satid=21701">orbital display</a> with current location information; you'll need to refresh periodically.</p>
<p>I wouldn't know where to start looking on Facebook for information.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Atmosphere_Research_Satellite" target="_self">Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite</a> page is getting an edit every few minutes, as wikipedians try to decide the proper balance between newsworthiness and encyclopedic content.</p>
<p>There are a few video channels that people are hosting, but none of them are very interesting. Instead, watch Weekend Update science editor John Belushi reporting on the impending <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/iss/skylab.deorbit.html">fall of Skylab</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">Facebook changes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Facebook is changing, again; that&#39;s not really news, since it seems to change all the time. Some people will like it, some people will hate it, and for the most part people will get used to it since they always seem to.</p>
<p>I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. It&#39;s remarkable that even stuff from four years ago was relatively easy to dig up; to do the same task on Twitter is impossible at the moment, and blog archive systems could learn a thing or two as well.</p>
<p>I&#39;m never going to end up with all of my digital history tucked away neatly inside the Facebook world; for better or for worse, it&#39;s too messy to find and not worthwhile to even think how to relive enough of the past. Still, there&#39;s something appealing now to a system that really has a sense of time, and where things that are old don&#39;t disappear.&#0160;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote this for a now defunct mailing list on the day after 9/11. It seems reasonable to post it now, to remember what happened in a way that doesn&#39;t focus on the event, but rather how much things have changed since then.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Saul and I went swimming today at the Y. The big pool was full of kids&#0160;taking lessons, and the little pool had 3 parents and their kids splashing&#0160;and kicking and in Saul&#39;s case swallowing a bit of water. The radio was&#0160;on rather loud in the lifeguard&#39;s office, with what sounded like NPR news&#0160;going. Earlier in the day we went to farmer&#39;s market - it&#39;s nearing the&#0160;end of the peach season, but there are peppers in abundance, and plenty of&#0160;tomatoes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely starting to be fall here, with leaves turning red on at&#0160;least one tree on my regular path downtown. [...]<br /><br />A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.<br /><br />By 11 am there were no copies of the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, or&#0160;even USA Today to be had from vending machines or from Borders.<br /><br />My immediate family is checking in, and everyone is accounted for.&#0160;I have three cousins in New York City, and my parents are visiting&#0160;my brother and sister-in-law in DC. There are stories to tell but<br />not now, I am not ready for that quite yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5R0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1304%2C767102" target="_self">Big rally on the Diag last night, something like 15,000 people were there</a>,&#0160;the&#0160;coverage from the student newspaper. We were putting Saul to bed at the&#0160;time.<br /><br />I spent far too much of Tuesday glued to the net, the radio, and to my&#0160;phone, and then late at night I finally hauled up our TV from the basement&#0160;and looked at some pictures.<br /><br />It&#39;s late now, and I don&#39;t really have a lot more to say. I would like to&#0160;hear what you are doing. I know that not everything is all right, but&#0160;even a few words about what your day is like, the sights and sounds around&#0160;you, would be nice to hear.<br /><br />For those of you who lost friends and loved ones yesterday, my&#0160;thoughts are with you.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee have made their way slowly from the Gulf of Mexico to the northeastern United States, bringing a storm with a slow-moving heavy rain. There is widespread flooding in the Susquehanna River basin and flash floods across the area. The Weather Underground&#39;s <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1921" target="_self">Jeff Masters has commentary on the storm</a> from the morning of September 8, 2011, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An extreme rainfall event unprecedented in recorded history has hit the&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBGM/2011/09/07/DailyHistory.html" target="_blank">Binghamton, New York</a>&#0160;area, where 7.49&quot; fell yesterday. This is the second year in a row Binghamton has recorded a 1-in-100 year rain event; their previous all-time record was set last September, when 4.68&quot; fell on Sep 30 - Oct. 1, 2010. Records go back to 1890 in the city. The skies have now cleared in Binghamton, with this morning&#39;s rain bringing the city&#39;s total rainfall for the 40-hour event to 9.02&quot;. However, another large region of rain lies just to the south in Pennsylvania, and all of the rivers in the surrounding region are in major or record flood. The Susquehanna River at Binghamton is at 25&#39;, its highest level since records began in 1847, and is expected to overtop the flood walls protecting the city this afternoon. In Hershey, Pennsylvania, Swatara Creek is 18&#39; over flood stage, and more than 8&#39; above its record flood crest. Widespread flash flooding is occurring across the entire area, and over 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.</p>

      <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://crisislanding.appspot.com/" target="_self">2011 hurricane season crisis map from Google</a>&#0160;has the first large scale version of a multi-utility outage map. It renders thematic maps from 5 east coast utilities (ConEdison, Pepco, Progress Energy, Delmarva and Atlantic City) on a single map, pulled from a KML (GeoRSS) file that notes the relative severity of the storms in each area. Map below shows a day with no severe outages, all blue; I&#39;ll need to compare with a post-storm power outage.</p>

<h3>DETROIT, Sept. 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy has introduced a new interactive iPhone application (app) for customers to access a variety of up-to-the-minute information, including real-time outage information from their mobile devices.</h3>
<p>The DTE Energy Outage Center app is available from the Apple iTunes App store or Apple.com free of charge.</p>
<p>Located at&#0160;<a href="http://dteenergy.com/" target="_blank">dteenergy.com</a>, the Outage Center is a central area online where consumers interested in getting the latest information about power outages, get tips on what to do during a storm or other frequently asked questions. DTE Energy is one of the first utilities in the country to allow customers to report power outages via a downloadable native mobile smartphone application. &#0160;</p>
<p>Using the app, DTE Energy customers can report power outages, view the status of a reported problem and explore a map illustrating the number of outages reported throughout the area.</p>
<p>DTE Energy has added this mobile capability to our existing suite of outage-related offerings to bring useful information to customers in the way they want or in an outage situation, where they are able to see it.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a variety of tools for our customers already available on the DTE Energy website and we want to extend those tools in new and engaging ways,&quot; said Patrick Duffy, Customer Service Manager with DTE Energy. With the summer storm season upon us, extending the outage reporting tools to the iPhone was a great place for us to start.&quot;</p>
<p>Additional mobile communications offerings, such as the ability to check account balances and submit mobile payments are currently in development. DTE Energy is also working on an application that supports Android devices.</p>
<p>DTE Energy expects the iPhone app to give users a convenient method to report problems and retrieve updates. The company worked with Southfield-based RIIS to develop and test the application, which allows customers to access information on outages in their neighborhood or throughout Michigan.</p>
<p>The creation of an iPhone app broadens the reach of DTE Energy&#39;s Outage Center tools to a wider audience.</p>
<p>DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) is a Detroit-based diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Its operating units include Detroit Edison, an electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan, MichCon, a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan and other non-utility, energy businesses focused on gas storage and pipelines, unconventional gas production, power and industrial projects, and energy trading.

      </h3>
      <p>Vermont was hard hit by Irene. There are lots of photos and videos out there showing some of the devastation and flooding; here are maps that give some sense for the area involved.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vermont-Flooding-2011/212455332141871" target="_self">Vermont Flooding 2011 on Facebook</a>&#0160;is a good community resource, as is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MRVpostIrene" target="_self">Mad River Valley Hurricane Irene</a>. For volunteer coordination, see the <a href="http://vtresponse.wordpress.com/" target="_self">VTResponse</a> weblog.</p>
<p>Detailed city maps showing flooded areas are not yet available. FEMA maps show the most vulnerable areas, and are available for <a href="http://www.ci.burlington.vt.us/planning/zoning/flood_recovery/sfha_maps.php" target="_self">Burlington</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://www.montpelier-vt.org/community/344.html" target="_self">Montpelier</a>, <a href="http://www.waitsfieldvt.us/flood/FIRM.cfm" target="_self">Waitsfield</a>, and other cities.</p>
<p>A collaborative map of the incident is <a href="http://vtirene.crowdmap.com/" target="_self">VTIrene</a>, hosted on Crowdmap. Another <a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/vtirene" target="_self">VTIrene collection by Dan Dowling on Scoop.IT</a>&#0160;has an aggregation of news, video, and twitter accounts.</p>
<p>Compare with the 1927 flood; the Landscape Change Program at the University of Vermont has <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/landscape/1927_flood/" target="_self">aerial photography of that event.</a>&#0160;See the National Weather Service&#39;s <a href="http://www.erh.noaa.gov/btv/events/27flood.shtml" target="_self">Flood of 1927</a> information.</p>
