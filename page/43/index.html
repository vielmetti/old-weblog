<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>Every so often my world gets influenced by the colors of things that I see, and I find the need to sort by color.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#39;m sorting a lot of web tabs by the color of the favicon, left to right in a rainbow, with <span style="background-color: #ffc0c0;">Gmail</span> (red) on the left and <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Google Calendar</span> (blue) on the right. Surprisingly few violet and indigo favicons, or else they would take the rightmost tabstop; I suspect that if I used <span style="background-color: #dfbfff;">Yahoo</span> more, I&#39;d sort the other way.</p>
<p>I&#39;m writing this in <span style="background-color: #dfffbf;">Typepad</span> (pale green, somewhere in the middle), and I notice right away that Markdown, the editor it had inside, doesn&#39;t have a color picker for text.</p>
<p>The programmers I work with use color-coded text all the time as part of their way to notice structural and syntax elements, but I think I&#39;d be really confused by that all the time - I&#39;m much more after semantic coloring than syntactic coloring. I also know that this kind of <span style="background-color: #ffff80;"><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/assisted-synesthesia-as-augmented-reality.html" target="_self">machine-assisted synaesthesia</a></span>&#0160;is an acquired taste&#0160;for me that comes and goes and doesn&#39;t seem yet to have consistent colors.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Google's <a href="http://trends.google.com">Google Trends</a>, on the <font color="red">UC Davis Pepper Spray</font> incident, characterizes the incident as "mild". The <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/11/18/police-pepper-spraying-arrest.html">Boing Boing coverage</a> shows the intensity much better. Perhaps most surprising from a public records standpoint is the lack of official acknowledgement of incidents in the <font color="blue"><a href="http://police.ucdavis.edu/crime/CrimeLogFolder">UC Davis police crime logs</a></font>, where given the size of the event I'd have expected a "crime alert" at the very least.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/LBPNA">Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association</a> that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the <a href="http://annarborbridges.org">Stadium Bridges project</a> are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.</p>

<p>The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/fig6f_05_longdesc.htm">M4-9b</a>. But instead of being aligned as a pedestrian sign, it's pointed along the path that cars will see. We're hoping this won't cause cars to go the wrong way down a one way street, thinking that the pedestrian detour is the automobile detour. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ericscheie.com/">Eric Scheie</a> for the night time photo of pedestrian detour signage in the Lower Burns Park neighborhood. </p>

<p>Riots is of course a loaded word, but that's what the media and public safety is using. Some stories about this evening's firing of long-time Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, and Penn State president Graham Spanier, and the sometimes violent reaction on the Happy Valley campus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Jon) Wertheim: This university lost their president today. What Jerry Sandusky is to alleged to have done is some of the most grotesque stuff you'll ever read, but it seems to be all about Joe Paterno tonight. It's just interesting to see a new wave of emotion here. It's anger, and it's frustration, and I imagine tomorrow's going to be completely different. This story keeps jumping around.</p>

  <p>Crowds began to gather around 10 p.m. on Beaver Avenue. After police in riot gear told them to move along, the students moved to Old Main. They sang the alma mater, professed their love for Paterno and profanely denounced Sandusky. They pointed toward Penn State president Graham Spanier's still-lit office. Then, after a brief "back to Beaver" chant, the crowd returned to Beaver Avenue. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. Department of Education said it will launch an investigation into whether Penn State failed to comply with an act requiring colleges and universities to disclose the number of reported criminal incidents on campus each year. "In addition, in certain cases, the institution must issue a timely warning if a reported crime represents a threat to the campus community," it said in a statement.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR USA, November 5-7, 2011 (Vacuum News) - There were a series of earthquakes in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, but we didn't feel them here in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p>Some maps and news from people who did feel the quakes follow. The data here are preliminary, and you'll want to go to the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usb0006klz.php">USGS page for the Oklahoma quake</a> for details, and <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/history.php">Oklahoma earthquake history</a> to figure out how normal this is. The <a href="http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov/">Oklahoma Geological Survey</a> is likely to also have excellent data. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/oklahoma-earthquake-sets-a-record.html">News coverage from the New York Times</a> quotes Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey; Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center; and Justin Reese, who runs the <a href="http://boomarangdiner.com/">Boomarang Diner</a> in Chandler, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The earthquake, originally reported at magnitude 5.2 and then upgraded to 5.6, was said to be felt [as far away as Milwaukee] - a claim which is being tested and that I haven't confirmed. <a href="http://earthquakes.tafoni.net/">Additional aftershocks were reported</a>; the map is by <a href="http://www.tafoni.net/">Dawn Endico</a> using the Google Maps API. Earthquake data provided by the U.S. Geological Survey on Mon, 07 Nov 2011 01:14:04 GMT.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?</p>

<p>There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. The VC in turn provides value by vetting the value of the allegedly valuable trade secret and is prepared to say "that's not a secret, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Paul Baran started a company doing that in 1985</a>".</p>

<p>A crafty tradesman is perpetually disclosing some relevant fragments of their trade knowledge at all times, in part to demonstrate competence, and in part to test whether what they know is really true.</p>

<p>As far as disclosure of trade secrets goes, I'd be much more worried about details leaking out inadvertently via ill-considered partners and subcontractors than via an investor.</p>

  <p>We are writing to inform you that you have now been added to the beta for Google Analytics Real-Time! As we announced the Real-Time reports show you what is happening on your website as it happens.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a>. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.</p>

<p>Google now has a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real time version of Google Analytics</a>, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it. It tells you in real time what pages are being looked at, where people are coming from to look at them, and which keywords and referring sites are driving traffic. It scratches some of the same itch that mybloglog used to scratch, when there's some kind of burst of news and you want to know what's going on in real time and not on tomorrow's reporting.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/02/mybloglog-is-officially-dead.html">mybloglog</a> had something that GA doesn't have and really hasn't had: tracking of clicks not to the site you're looking at, but to something out there in the world that you linked to. That was great to use - and something that made it easy to see that you were successful as a blogger because you were driving traffic elsewhere. That's gone; maybe someone will build it, but maybe they won't.</p>

<p>As for the big purple squeeze of love, see also delicious, <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/delicious-mangled-by-carpetbaggers.html">mangled by carpetbaggers</a> after being abandoned by Yahoo.

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.</p>
<p>The organization announced its new web site, <a href="http://northburnspark.org" target="_self">northburnspark.org</a> , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</p>
<p>Residents expressed their concerns about municipal and neighborhood issues to each other and to several area elected officials who are residents of the neighborhood, including Mayor John Hieftje, Councilman Christopher Taylor, Washtenaw County commissioner Yousef Rabhi, and the recently appointed city administrator Steve Powers. (Does Steve live in the neighborhood?) (Links to names?)</p>
<p>Noise was a concern shared by several citizens, who expressed their frustration that nearby religious services, University functions, special events and construction activity generated noise far beyond ordinary noise limits yet were exempted by permits or the University&#39;s special relationship as an autonomous body. (Link to noise articles?) (mention Big House run by name?)</p>
<p>Mayor John Hieftje addressed citizen concerns regarding crime, noting that overall crime statistics as measured according to the FBI&#39;s standard reporting criteria are down across the board. Hieftje was critical of the media&#39;s portrayal of crime issues and perceptions of crime. It was noted (by whom?) that the increased awareness of near-campus crime was due in part to the University&#39;s direct dissemination of crime information and alerts. (Explain the Cleary Act? Link to municipal maps?)</p>
<p>Residents in North Burns Park (who, specifically?) expressed specific concerns about parking in near-campus apartments, noting that landlords have converted back yards into parking lots in excess of the city standard of 4 on-site spaces for a (which, specifically?) apartment unit.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Who? A couple of petanque enthusiasts) described the courts which they had helped in getting installed at the northeast corner of Burns Park (on some date) and invited neighbors to join in their enthusiasm for the game. Petanque is a French game similar to (boules) or bocce, played with metal balls on a gravel court. Students at Burns Park Elementary School learn petanque as part of their PE classes, and (the couple) are looking forward to a June 2012 event to raise money for ALS (as part of A2A3).</p>
<p>Long term residents were happy to see each other again at this annual meeting event, and new residents were welcomed. About (how many, 35?) were in attendance. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 pm and residents ate some but not all of the cider and cookies provided before walking home.</p>
