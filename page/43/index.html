<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at201109.html" target="_self">Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene</a> page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated.</p>
<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-pi"><img alt="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015390ee3c91970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Aal09_2011082306_track_late" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p>Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov" target="_self">National Hurricane Center&#39;</a>s Irene archive has a fascinating <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/graphics/al09/loop_5W.shtml" target="_self">loop of 5 day Hurricane Irene forecasts</a>, showing the evolving best forecast track for the storm. It&#39;s a clear look not only at where the storm is going but also where projections have changed, in this case the projections that (on Tuesday) have landfall in North Carolina instead of Florida.&#0160;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/" target="_self">Tropical Cyclone Guidance Project at NCAR</a>&#0160;has an even more detailed set of <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/guidance/realtime/plots/northatlantic/2011/al092011/" target="_self">data for Hurricane Irene</a>, including an archive of sets of model predictions for the storm.</p>
<p>After the storm, the set of models will be compared to the actual path to verify model accuracy. This National Weather Service <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/index.shtml" target="_self">National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification</a>&#0160;report charts forecast accuracy over time, noting how improved modeling and added computing power has made storm forecasting more accurate over time. How much better? Consider that the average 24 hour forecast error was 100 miles in 1990, but only 50 miles in 2010; also, that the models currently in use give as good a 5 day forecast (about 225 miles off) as the 2 day forecast was in 1988.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-17-what-to-write/">What to write</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next.</p>
<p>Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that. A second is the perennially interesting article which routinely gets seasonal traffic when the world looks for that bit of information that they look for every year.</p>
<p>A third type of post, of course, is this one, which gets no appreciable readership in the short run or in the long run; that&#39;s mostly typical.</p>
<p>Writing the perennially interesting piece is hard, because you need to care about something deeply enough to capture a piece of what you and the world know about it that&#39;s of enduring interest and that&#39;s enough better than the rest of the net that people will find it. Once you do track this down, your search logs will lead you to variations and refinements that make the post better. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html" target="_self">power outage maps</a> post has this quality.</p>
<p>The post with a burst of intense newsworthiness is generally not newsworthy beyond two or three days. If you are fortunate, you have collected something that is otherwise interesting. I have a habit of collecting incident and situation maps for emerging events; this recent <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/08/august-2011-london-riot-maps.html" target="_self">London riot map</a> post is of that type.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to think that I don&#39;t need to have an audience (beyond myself) for this writing, but that said, it&#39;s always good to see that at least someone reads something that you write. (Otherwise, you&#39;d be better off putting in on paper and then recycling it immediately.) When I&#39;ve tried to use a blog as mostly a collection point, it has helped to divide out a separate blog for that purpose. My <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/telegraph" target="_self">telegraphy blog</a> admits the notion that on any given day zero or one person might read it, but it has been assembled as a collection, not a narrative. For some other ongoing efforts, a wiki might be more appropriate, e.g. for <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor history</a>, <a href="http://camera-wiki.org" target="_self">cameras</a>, or encyclopedic knowledge about <a href="http://t.tatianastomatobase.com:88/wiki/Main_Page" target="_self">tomatoes</a>. &#0160;</p>

      <p>There is an instinct, when things go bad, to want to make sense of the situation by putting the fragments of information that you have on a map.

      </h3>
      <p>A trip to the Goodwill store in Marquete, MI prompted an examination of their media collection. I ignored the piles of CDs, skipped the shelf of LPs, and went to the bin that had cassettes and 8-tracks. For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;. On the video shelves, there were plenty of 1990s vintage VHS tapes and a whole shelf of VHS players stacked up.</p>
<p>This is the same store that had a 1973 Reader&#39;s Digest Almanac on the shelf, reporting earnestly on the issues of the day (Nixon, food prices).</p>
<p>The 8-track discovery led me to do some searching, and I found a whole collection of <a href="http://www.fwweekly.com/index.php?option=com_wordpress&amp;tag=the-dead-media&amp;Itemid=12" target="_self">stories in the Fort Worth Weekly about The Dead Media</a>, an 8-track record label with a handful of new releases. &#0160;See <a href="http://deadmediatapes.com/" target="_self">DeadMediaTapes.com</a>&#0160;for the work of&#0160;Fort Worth R&amp;B singer-songwriter&#0160;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/browningham" target="_blank">Nathan Brown</a>.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how long these 8-tracks have been rattling around, and what path they took to get to this particular Goodwill. &#0160;They had the dusty patina of unloved old media, still recognizably worth something, but not yet at a home that would appreciate them. &#0160; They aren&#39;t hip, or trendy, or ironic; they&#39;re just old, at least in this place.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-29-cyberspace-is-gone/">anti-internet texts from the 1990s</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acturban.org/biennial/doc_planners/treanor_internet_hyperliberalism.htm" target="_self">The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism</a>&#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. On the contrary: never before in history, have so many separate networks been technically possible. Linking all networks together is a conscious choice by some people, a choice then imposed on others. The logic is identical to that of colonial governments, which forced peasants into the agricultural market, by imposing cash taxes. (To pay the tax, the peasants had to sell cash crops such as sugar). This logic says in effect: &#39;no one is free to stay outside the free market&#39;. Today, not just governments, but business, social movements, intellectuals and artists, all want to impose the Net. This broad movement is obviously more than profit-seeking (and a non-profit Net would also be wrong). It is an ideological movement seeking ideological imposition. That imposition itself, the universalism, the expansionism, their involuntary nature, the basic unfreedom to exit - that is what makes liberal structures wrong. That applies to the free market, and it applies inherently to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://folksonomy.co/?permalink=2299" target="_self">Pandora&#39;s Vox Redux</a> (humdog, 1994)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many times in cyberspace, i felt it necessary to say that i was human. once, i was told that i existed primarily as a voice in somebody’s head. lots of times, i need to see handwriting on paper or a photograph or a phone conversation to confirm the humanity of the voice, but that is the way that i am. i resist being boxed and inventoried and i guess i take william gibson seriously when he writes about machine intelligence and constructs. i do not like it. i suspect that my words have been extracted and that when this essay shows up, they will be extracted some more. when i left cyberspace, i left early one morning and forgot to take out the trash. two friends called me on the phone afterwards and said, hummie your directory is still there. and i said OH. and they knew and i knew, that it was possible that people had been entertaining themselves with the contents of my directories. the amusement never ends, as peter gabriel wrote. maybe sometime i will rant again if something interesting comes up. in the meantime, give my love to the FBI.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cliff Stoll in Newsweek, <a href="http://threewordchant.com/2010/02/24/why-the-internet-will-fail-from-1995/" target="_self">Why The Internet Will Fail</a> (1995)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s missing from this electronic wonderland? Human contact. Discount the fawning techno-burble about virtual communities. Computers and networks isolate us from one another. A network chat line is a limp substitute for meeting friends over coffee. No interactive multimedia display comes close to the excitement of a live concert. And who’d prefer cybersex to the real thing? While the Internet beckons brightly, seductively flashing an icon of knowledge-as-power, this nonplace lures us to surrender our time on earth. A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality where frustration is legion and where–in the holy names of Education and Progress–important aspects of human interactions are relentlessly devalued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mid-1990s were a good time to be high-mindedly anti-network.</p>

Here&#39;s the relevant text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#0160;The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A relevant case, perhaps, is <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137&amp;q=perry+v+united+states&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000003" target="_self">Perry v United States 1935</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly declares: &quot;The validity of the public debt of the&#0160;<strong>United&#0160;</strong><strong>States</strong>, authorized by law, . . . shall not be questioned.&quot; While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the Government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation. We regard it as confirmatory of a fundamental principle, which applies as well to the government bonds in question, and to others duly authorized by the Congress, as to those issued before the Amendment was adopted. Nor can we perceive any reason for not considering the expression &quot;the&#0160;<em>validity</em>&#0160;of the public debt&quot; as embracing whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which a contemporary legal scholar, Henry Hart Jr, wrote at the time</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>what was confusing to the reporter at the ﬁrst reading is even more so to the commentator at the hundredth.&#0160;Few more baffling pronouncements, it is fair to say, have ever issued from the United States Supreme Court</em>.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dissenting opinion in this case is as strongly worded as any: from Justice McReynolds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loss of reputation for honorable dealing will bring us unending humiliation; the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, let&#39;s hope to not have to go there.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 18, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --</p>
<p>Borders Group reported today that, in accordance with the terms of its financing agreement, the Company will submit to the Court for approval the previously-announced proposal from&#0160;Hilco and Gordon Brothers&#0160;to purchase the store assets of the business and administer the liquidation process. Borders said that, in the absence of a formal proposal from a going concern bidder, it did not require an auction prior to presenting the proposal to the Court at a scheduled hearing on&#0160;Thursday, July 21, 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the best efforts of all parties, we are saddened by this development,&quot; said Borders Group President&#0160;Mike Edwards. &quot;We were all working hard towards a different outcome, but the headwinds we have been facing for quite some time, including the rapidly changing book industry, eReader revolution, and turbulent economy, have brought us to where we are now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For decades, Borders stores have been destinations within our communities, places where people have sought knowledge, entertainment, and enlightenment and connected with others who share their passion. Everyone at Borders has helped millions of people discover new books, music, and movies, and we all take pride in the role Borders has played in our customers&#39; lives,&quot; Edwards continued, &quot;I extend a heartfelt thanks to all of our dedicated employees and our loyal customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Borders currently operates 399 stores and employs approximately 10,700 employees. Subject to the Court&#39;s approval, under the proposal, liquidation is expected to commence for some stores and facilities as soon as&#0160;Friday, July 22, with a phased rollout of the program which is expected to conclude by the end of September. Borders intends to liquidate under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, as a result, Borders expects to be able to pay vendors in the ordinary course for all expenses incurred during the bankruptcy cases.</p>

      <p>Thanks to a a promo code I had a chance to look at <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/hello-america/" target="_self">Spotify</a>. Some first impressions.</p>
<p>The service looks like an iTunes which you can play any song that you can find, for free. I haven&#39;t probed the catalog to see how deep it is, but the Beatles and Bob Dylan are represented by cover bands, not the originals. It&#39;s shiny, and the music plays instantly when you click on a song.</p>
<p>1. It doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Napster; perhaps nothing ever will, again. Part of the joy of Napster was the thrill of the chase, knowing that every time you searched it it would be a little different, and that every possible obscure track might be online some day so if it wasn&#39;t there you just wanted to come back the next day.</p>
<p>2. I can&#39;t reconstruct the playlist for all of the tracks on the mix CD in my car, so for some definition of &quot;completeness&quot;, it isn&#39;t complete. That may say more about my tastes in music than anything else. I suppose that anyone who favors Da Yoopers and Barcelona is going to have problems with any service conceived in this decade.</p>
<p>3. Coca-Cola ads everywhere, plus splashy art for artists I don&#39;t know anything about. I suppose that&#39;s a plausible monetization strategy, but it&#39;s distracting.</p>
<p>4. After playing 5 or 6 tracks it put up an advertisement for an 80s playlist, which means that either it&#39;s profiling my interests from the songs I play, or it&#39;s otherwise assuming that how old I am specifies my musical tastes relatively completely.</p>
<p>Looks like a great service, but I&#39;m clearly not the target demographic.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>MARQUETTE – Faye M. Amo, age 57, of 425 West Ridge Street, Marquette,
entered eternal life Wednesday evening, July 13, 2011, at her home
in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula
Home Health and Hospice.</p>

<p>Born March 23, 1954 in Lima, Ohio, a daughter of Stephen J. and
Ethel (Salidas) Catel, Faye was raised in Ishpeming and graduated
from the Ishpeming High School as salutatorian of her class. From
her days in grade school, Faye held the desire to become a teacher.
She enrolled at Northern Michigan University, where she received
her baccalaureate degree summa cum laude (with highest honor) with
a double major in French and English. She continued at Northern,
obtaining a double masters degree in English and French in 1977 and
later studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris where she
earned highest honors in French.</p>

<p>Faye’s
lifelong dream of becoming a teacher began with her first teaching
assignment at the Ishpeming High School in 1977. In 1979, she started
teaching French at the Marquette Senior High School, a career that
would span 31 years. Teaching French was her passion in life and
she loved all her students and they loved her. Affectionately known
as Madame Amo, she was the consummate professional teacher, one who
truly cared about her students and was dedicated to their education
and well-being.</p>

<p>It was not enough that the
students learned the French language, she felt they needed to
experience what “French” meant. Heading the French Club at Marquette
Senior High School, Faye planned numerous trips for club members
to big city museums to view French art exhibits, eat at French
eateries, and learn about French culture. Over the years, several
trips were taken to Chicago and to France in her mission to educate.
These memorable events were always anticipated by Faye and greeted
with enthusiasm by her students. For a number of years, she served
as class advisor, particularly enjoying building and decorating
floats for homecoming and decorating the gym for junior prom
activities. Throughout her life, Faye maintained an untiring interest
in the students at MSHS, often asking parents about their children,
even through the children may never have been her students and she
kept in regular contact with students who were now living adult
lives, with families of their own.</p>

<p>In addition
to her affiliations at MSHS as foreign language department head for
several years, class advisor for the MSHS graduating class of 2008,
and serving on numerous parent-teacher committees, Faye was also a
member of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption and the Ladies
Philoptochos Society, and active in civic committees such as the
American Association of University Women and the Marquette
Beautification Committee. In her leisure, Faye loved walking her
dog, Mario, for the 13 years of his life, bicycling, running – even
participating in marathons in Detroit and France, and riding in her
boat on beautiful Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Faye is
survived by her husband, John; her cherished son, Bret; two sisters,
Stephanie (Bob) Trumm and Jayme (Rick) Iknoiah both of California;
her mother-in-law, Leone Amo of Ironwood; brothers-in-law, Tom Amo
of Philadelphia, PA, Jim (Brooke) Amo of Livonia, and Ken Amo of
Ft Worth, TX; and several nieces and nephews. Faye was preceded in
death by her father, the honorable judge, Stephen J. Catel, her
mother, Ethel Catel; brother-in-law, Andrew Walton; and father-in-law,
John M. Amo.</p>

<p>The family will receive friends
at the Swanson-Lundquist Funeral Home on Sunday from 4:00 pm until
7:00 pm. Trisagion will be held at 6:00 pm. The Funeral Liturgy
will be held on Monday, July 18, at 11:00 am at the Greek Orthodox
Church of the Assumption with Rev. Tom Michalos officiating. Burial
will be made in the Park Cemetery. Pallbearers will be Jimmy Pedakis,
Lou Roumanis, Paul Andronis, Paul Wainio, Gary Shaffer, and Craig
Cox. Memorials may be directed to the Greek Orthodox Church of the
Assumption, 235 W. Ridge Street, Marquette, MI 49855 or to the Faye
Amo Scholarship Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 101 W. Washington Street,
Marquette, MI 49855. Condolences may be expressed online at

paix.</p>

      <p>Google+ is to Twitter as Usenet is to IRC. Discuss.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m writing this down just so I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore; I don&#39;t know what Facebook is in this context.)</p>
<p>To elaborate: Google+ is like Usenet, except with no newsgroups, and most of the control over what you read being done through kill files and keep files. It&#39;s so busy that you can never catch up, and the default group is a combination of rec.pets.cats, talk.bizarre, and news.announce.newusers.</p>
<p>Twitter is like IRC, except that you&#39;re all on one channel. The hashtag syntax creates things similar to channels, which makes the whole mess easier to keep up with as long as your interests can be narrowed.&#0160;</p>
<p>In both cases, the inversion from the original system is that the fundamental unit of following is no longer the topic, it&#39;s the person. If your favorite Dr. Who fan also publishes lots of photos of their cats, you have to read them both together. There&#39;s no way on Google+ to carve out a narrow channel for deep discussion, not yet at least - you would expect that is the natural evolution, just as Twitter added support for emergent hash tags after they had been invented.</p>

      <p>The ability (and the need) to edit other people&#39;s words is a sign of power over them, especially when it can be done without leaving a trace.&#0160;</p>
<p>The WELL, one of the ur-communities online, has this bold fundamental statement of literary authority:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.well.com/yoyow.html" target="_self">You own your own words.</a> This means that you are responsible for the words that you post on the WELL and that reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside of the WELL&#39;s conferencing system may be challenged by you, the author.</strong></blockquote>
<div>Every other online system I&#39;ve ever seen has something much weaker than this. The typical contribution to most networked writing places grants an unlimited license to reuse the work, with this one no worse than most:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.politonomist.com/important-notices/" target="_self">By posting a comment on Politonomist.com</a>, you grant Politonomist and it’s subsidiaries an indefinite and unlimited license to reproduce, edit and make use of the comment in any non-slanderous method seen fit.</blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<p>At least they said &quot;non-slanderous&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental reasons that I continue to write on my own weblog as opposed to transferring my digital identity to some other system is that I have edit rights on all of the content and all of the discontent here. If someone publishes a comment, I have the ability to modify, delete, and quote from it. I&#39;m not certain that I&#39;ve asserted any specific moral rights to do this, but practically the &quot;edit&quot; button is all you need.</p>
<p>Oh, to be writing in a place where word ownership was unambiguous.</p>

      <p>A fascinating account of how Zappo&#39;s improved the quality of reviews on its site by hiring Mechanical Turkers to correct spelling and grammar. From <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/04/want-to-improve-sales-fix-grammar-and.html" target="_self">Behind the Enemy Lines</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An online retailer noticed that, indeed, products with high-quality reviews are selling well. So, they decided to take action. The retailer used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of the reviews posted on its own website. Using the&#0160;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/soylent.pdf">Find-Fix-Verify pattern</a>, the retailed used Mechanical Turk to examine&#0160;<strong><em>millions&#0160;</em></strong>of product reviews. (Here are the archived versions of the HITs:&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/79f44798e8c296e29bddbd3a3aa8f60a/">Find</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/160L5FUZB7DDN03NIAB2D4J8HRZ022/">Fix</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://mturk-tracker.com/hit/1QPDXYWLI7K28IZ6MAP7WEO0N6V03B/">Verify</a>. And if you have not figured out the firm name by now, the retailer is Zappos.) For the reviews with mistakes,<strong><em>they fixed the spelling and grammar errors! Thus they effectively improved the quality of the reviews on their website. And, correspondingly, they improved the demand for their products.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The estimated copy editing cost is $0.10 per review. Imagine how many other paragraph-sized chunks of text could be improved for a dime a piece, this post included.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I can't help myself to think of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle when considering the new Google+ system and how it organizes people into circles. The circle, properly constructed, is a "karass", the people who you are following around and around. The pivot of the karass is a "wampeter", the thing which draws you together - "a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail".</p>
<p>I go back to Seb Paquet's <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/2002/10/09.html#a426" target="_self">essay on ridiculously easy group formation</a>&nbsp;as a sense for how the Internet used to be if you wanted to start a collective enterprise. Most of the tasks at that time were relatively heavyweight, in that you had to begin something and set up the software infrastructure before you started to use it. Now, with most social networks, group formation is as easy as settling on a name for what you are doing, making that name prominent within your communications (e.g. using it as a hash tag), and then just doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at Google+ for pivots, you find people, but not ideas. Energy clusters around individual activity, and though it's possible to nominally describe a circle of people as being interested in football or ice hockey, you can't guarantee that those people will reciprocate by only writing about football or ice hockey. One thing you do all have in common, though is Google+ - and thus the wampeter that draws you all in is the system itself.</p>
<p>Following Vonnegut again there are two wampeters for each karass, one waxing, one waning. Fortunately we do have the other one named here already; an animal. Specifically a cat.</p>

      <p>For all I know, the entire Google+ is a Turing machine over in Mountain View, and I&#39;m talking to myself.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of the fun of <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_self">Google+</a>&#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &quot;circles&quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&#39;s private groups). It&#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard.</p>
<p>If Google knew who I went to high school with, it would be inviting me to make a &quot;high school friends&quot; circle, and it would be planning a reunion. But it&#39;s Facebook where that activity is going on, and Facebook where that particular circle of friends and former friends lives. It lives there not because I carefully and laboriously put it there but because Facebook has a group structure (however imperfect) that allows for shared group building, shared tagging of photos, shared lots of things.<br /><br />On Google+ I have no visibility into what other people&#39;s groupings for me are. If you think about just that, it&#39;s remarkable - no one would add me to a mailing list and start sending me things without me knowing it, and no one adds me to a named Facebook community or even a Twitter list without that being at least nominally visible. Yet only Google knows what other people categorize me as, and as more random names show up in my &quot;you were just added to a circle by...&quot; list, the more that particular information asymmetry seems to be visible.</p>
<p>It has been wearying to try to make sense of circles. If you engage in the system, you are expected to classify and categorize all of your correspondents into some kind of bucket that describes them. Alas, real people are many faceted, and don&#39;t fit into any single oversimplified category or stay narrowly focused on one topic. More to the point, I can&#39;t stay on topic myself unless I have a separate place narrowly defined where I&#39;m exploring a topic rather than just vacuuming up something interesting.</p>
<p>Google+ circles have cut into my sleep, and that&#39;s why you see circles under my eyes. I&#39;m better off resting up and spending the time creating things rather than figuring out which tiny bucket to sort them into.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.</p>
<p>In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like <a href="http://www.radioreference.com" target="_self">Radio Reference</a>, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in. They may have more context of the local situation, more access to people in positions of leadership, or more ability to get someone on the street to see something interesting, but they are not there first on the scene with exclusive coverage.</p>
<p>Last night, over ten thousand people listened in live and in real time as a hostage situation in Grand Rapids, Michigan came to a violent end over the police scanner. Everyone listening heard it first hand, before the news media had a chance to interpret it for them.</p>
<p>The best account of listening to the scanner is Mark W. Smith&#39;s Detroit Free Press piece, &quot;<a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110708/NEWS06/110708030/Mark-W-Smith-Online-police-scanner-an-eerie-window-into-gunman-s-standoff" target="_self">Online police scanner an eerie window into gunman&#39;s standoff</a>&quot;, which paints a vivid picture of what it was like to be in a newsroom listening to scanner traffic from hundreds of miles away. In contrast, Nathan Bomey&#39;s piece &quot;<a href="http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/grand-rapids-murders-terrorize-but-jennifer-granholm-tweeting-about-her-new-chevy-volt/" target="_self">Grand Rapids murders terrorize, but Jennifer Granholm tweeting about her new Chevy Volt</a>&quot; is noteworthy primarily for not sounding like it was written with the scanner going in the background - because if you were paying attention to what was happening in Grand Rapids while it was happening, you&#39;d never even have noticed that some people weren&#39;t yet tuned in yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-recyclebank/">Recyclebank Ann Arbor reports released; coupon redemption rates are low, but people recycle anyway</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the City of Ann Arbor has released reports showing the participation rate of Ann Arbor households in the <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/" target="_self">Recyclebank</a> program, which rewards citizens for putting out their recycling. The reports were provided in graphical format, so all numbers here are approximated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20May%202011%20Report.pdf" target="_self">summary report of program performance</a> provided in response to the request shows that about 40% of eligible citizens (about 9500 of 24000) have signed up for the program. These citizens accumulate points which can be exchanged for coupons that offer discounts to participating merchants. In the most recent month reported, May 2011, citizens earned about 1.5 million points and cashed in about 10% of them, resulting in about 1600 rewards ordered.</p>
<p>The Recyclebank contract costs the City of Ann Arbor about $200,000 per year. At current reward redemption rates, citizens will cash in on the order of 20,000 reward coupons, or less than one per eligible household, at an estimated program cost of approximately $10 per delivered coupon. This number could be $15 per coupon at the low monthly participation rate, and $7 per coupon at the high monthly rate; participation varies with the seasons, and a complete year of data is not yet in.</p>
<p>The reports provided do not address the question of whether rewards are increasing participation in the recycling program. If it did, this <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/solidwasteunit/Documents/Ann%20Arbor%20Route%20by%20Route%20Report%20May%202011.pdf" target="_self">detail report showing recycling rates per route</a> would also include a Recyclebank participation rate per route, and you&#39;d be able to see at a glance whether routes with a high degree of Recyclebank participation correlate with increased recycling performance.</p>
<p>Are incentives driving increased recycling use? The reports provided do not make a compelling case. Redemption rates are so low that most people don&#39;t appear to bother cashing in their rewards. Even with this low redemption rate, almost 90% of people put their recycle cart out at least once a month, suggesting that people in Ann Arbor are already recycling at a high rate independent of external rewards.</p>
