<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p><p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/24/weather-journal-storm-could-make-next-week-a-mess/" target="_self">Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name</a>.</p>

<p>Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.</p>

<p>The Twitter hashtag is #<a href="http://twitter.com/#snoreastercane" target="_self">snoreastercane</a> and is in use already, with comments like this from @LoriG: &quot;Unexpected consequence of global warming: having to learn the names of a bunch of new types of storms&quot;. Most of the storm traffic is on #<a href="http://twitter.com/#sandy" target="_self">sandy</a>. </p>
<p>The other name for the storm is &quot;Frankenstorm&quot;, from the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd&amp;version=0&amp;fmt=reg" target="_self">Hydrometeorological Prediction Center</a>&#0160;extended forecast for Thursday, October 25, 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] These models are predicting that Sandy will get caught up by the trough approaching the Eastern U.S., which will inject a large amount of energy into the storm, converting it to a powerful subtropical storm with a central pressure below 960 mb and sustained winds of 60 - 70 mph. Winds of this strength would likely cause massive power outages, as trees still in leaf take out power lines. Also of great concern are Sandy&#39;s rains. Given that ocean temperatures along the Northeast U.S. coast are about&#0160;<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at">5°F above average</a>, there will be an unusually large amount of water vapor available to make heavy rain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy is now a category 1 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and central pressure of 970 hPa (see picture).&#0160; My community is all aflutter about this storm, particularly since our forecast models are&#0160;<strong>not&#0160;</strong>in agreement&ndash;some suggest the storm will intensify and head straight in to the Middle Atlantic coastline, some take it out to sea, and others move it out to sea before swinging it westward to hit New England or the Canadian maritimes.<br /><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?</p>
<p>I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;<a href="https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-October/date.html" target="_self">outages</a>&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. One report of call failures listed the following cities:</p>
<pre>Cedar Rapids
Springfield, IL
Madison, WI
Green Bay, WI
Minneapolis
Sioux Falls
Omaha
Des Moines
Dubuque
Fargo
St. Louis
Davenport
Kansas City
Detroit

      </h3>
      <p>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:</p>
<p>1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.</p>
<p>2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</p>
<p>3. Cast 4 votes, leaving none behind, and choosing one of the candidates you are opposed to to round out the ballot.</p>
<p>The strategy is called &quot;bullet voting&quot;, and it has some pros and cons which are neatly spelled out in this <a href="http://larrydavidson.blogspot.com/2005/09/bullet-voting-pro-and-con.html" target="_self">2005 blog post from Larry Davidson</a>.&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, to bullet-vote or not? The choice depends entirely on which scenario you think is more probable. If the race for fourth place is between your two favorite candidates, you should bullet-vote. If the race for fourth place is between your second choice and someone you strongly dislike, you should not bullet-vote. Maybe it’s not how they would handle it on&#0160;<em>Numb3rs,&#0160;</em>but math can’t give you a definite answer here.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullet voting is also known as &quot;plunking&quot;. The general case of voting systems being gamed by strategic voters is more common than you&#39;d expect, since it can give a coordinated minority the ability to decide an election over a disorganized majority.</p>

      <p>I had my first chance to sit at the new Elixir Vitae cafe on East Liberty today. The store is one of two with that name, after the Cafe Ambrosia store on Maynard Street changed its name. (Same ownership, just a new name, because of conflicts with too many other coffee businesses called Ambrosia).</p>
<p>Some impressions:</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more sunshine in the new cafe than there ever was in the old one. Maynard is shaded by the parking structure and by Tower Plaza, but East Liberty has a nice south-facing window and light coming in.</p>
<p>The general ambiance is about the same, but not as many people have discovered the new cafe just yet. I&#39;m expecting it to eventually get something between a Main Street and a State Street sense to it, but for now, I was mostly alone in using the place for an extended typing session.</p>
<p>The local events bulletin board has a good selection to look at - it&#39;s not quite as big as the Maynard location, which has in my opinion one of the finest bulletin boards in town.</p>
<p>All in all a solid showing and a good new place to go.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor City Council holds meetings twice each month, which are <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/communicationsoffice/ctn/meetingplace/Pages/TheMeetingPlace.aspx" target="_self">streamed online through the city&#39;s CTN network</a>. I tuned in last night on my laptop to listen and watch.</p>
<p>While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=typd" target="_self">a2council</a>&#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience. The running cmmentary made it easier to follow what was going on, and it served as a back channel to help make sense of the proceedings.</p>
<p>The council was working from an agenda that&#39;s in the <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com" target="_self">Legistar system</a>, and from time to time I&#39;d go back to that to see what the text of an agenda item was, to look at supporting materials, and see the detail.</p>
<p>The Ann Arbor Chronicle does near-real-time news coverage as a <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/category/civic-news-ticker/" target="_self">Civic News Ticker</a>, reporting out results from key votes and decisions during the meeting. This is brief coverage but important, and it sets the stage for their 10,000 word meeting reports that come out a week or so later.</p>
<p>Finally, I had a window open to <a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a>, which has a local encyclopedia of information about what is going on in the city and the surrounding area. As council considered various options, I looked up what Arborwiki had to say about the current state of affairs, and updated it as best I could to reflect the meeting results and the news that was happening.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that watching this multi-connected stream was different from the experience of being in the same room as council. You miss the non-verbal communications, the body language, the hallway conversations that take place during breaks, and all sorts of in-person nuance. But for what it was, I&#39;m pretty happy with the experience. It felt like I was engaged with the meeting and could have a sense that I was part of the civic process.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org" target="_self">Arborwiki</a> is a local encyclopedia about the Ann Arbor area that anyone can edit. Up til now, it&#39;s been running on the same Mediawiki software that powers Wikipedia, but we&#39;re in the process of moving it to a new Localwiki instance.</p>
<p><a href="http://localwiki.org" target="_self">Localwiki</a> is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California. The Localwiki software is especially good at handling maps, and so it should be that much easier to map out the streets and roads of Ann Arbor and surrounding Washtenaw County.</p>
<p>There&#39;s now also a new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/" target="_self">Facebook group</a> to discuss Arborwiki, which has been handy for sorting through restart visuals. I&#39;ll make sure to invite everyone who has touched the project so far to it.</p>
<p>In response to some questions:</p>
<p>The migration process has been relatively smooth so far, with about 10,000 pages moved in without much in the way of hand-editing things to patch them up. There&#39;s an importer for Mediawiki pages into Localwiki that handles a lot of the heavy lifting. We had to redesign the home page to take advantage of the new include file syntax, and there are some Mediawiki templates that I used for automatically generating links to news clippings that I&#39;ll have to reimagine. Localwiki founder Philip Neustrom has been a big help, and we&#39;re running on a Ubuntu instance that Ryan Eby at the Ann Arbor District Library spun up for us.</p>
<p>Not a lot of the Arborwiki pages had maps on them, so Philip wrote a little bit of custom code to make that happen more frequently by automatically recognizing some pages with addresses on them.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Sidewalks</strong></p>
<p>In 1888, an Ann Arbor City Council meeting was dominated by petitions from citizens for the city to put in sidewalks.

<p>On Monday night, the Ann Arbor City Council meeting had an extended discussion of filling in the gaps in the city&#39;s sidewalk network. Council members noted several locations in their wards where students did not have a safe way to walk to school on sidewalks or a safe place to cross busy streets; others on council noted that the existing non-motorized transportation plan already addressed this and other issues. When it came to a vote, the proposal to study sidewalk gaps was turned down 6-5.

      </h3>
      <p>As I listen to a plane go overhead today, I remember how quiet it was here in Ann Arbor after 9/11 when the entire US airspace was shut down. You could hear the birds a lot more easily, and the sky was clear.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/09/the-day-after-what-9122001-was-like.html" target="_self">what I wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/june04/geophen.html" target="_self">Geotimes, 2004</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The empty skies also allowed David Travis of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and his co-workers to determine how contrails might be changing local temperature. Their results, first published in&#0160;<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/418601a.html" target="_self"><em>Nature</em>&#0160;in August 2002</a> and further elucidated last March in the&#0160;<em>Journal of Climate</em>, showed that during the days when jets were grounded in September 2001, sunshine increased the temperature at ground level instead of being reflected by contrails. At night, the researchers found, the absence of an insulating layer of contrails meant greater ground level cooling.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s hard to think that this happened more than a decade ago.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>906 day (September 6) celebrates the area code of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. First I&#39;ve heard of this holiday, but I heartily approve.</p>
<p>In honor of this day a couple of nice photos of Marquette, MI came via Shorpy. The photos of the <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12492" target="_self">harbor and ore docks</a>, <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12489" target="_self">Front Street</a>, and a <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/12493" target="_self">panorama of downtown Marquette</a>&#0160;date from 1908 and 1909 and are from glass negatives from the Detroit Publishing Company.</p>
<p>A detail below shows the Hotel Janzen, with a train&#39;s smoke just to the left of it and a piece of City Hall at the far left.</p>

      <p>My Facebook stream is full of pictures of kids on their first day of school. (That&#39;s great!) Sorry that I don&#39;t have a first day, or even a second day, photo to share.</p>
<p>The second day at our house featured a last-minute lunch prep (mac and cheese) and then two bicycle rides, one each for the 7th grader and for the 2d grader. The Burns Park school grounds were busy with a stream of parents and kids coming for dropoff; I haven&#39;t seen the new Summers-Knoll morning rush yet.</p>
<p>By all guesses it&#39;s going to be a good year.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-30-hurricane-isaac-flood-maps-and-flooding-predictions/">Hurricane Isaac flood maps and flooding predictions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Hurricane Isaac brought with it high winds and a substantial amount of rain, and both of those combined has led to a lot of flooding. Here are some maps I&#39;ve collected while the storm is still underway. You should know that for each of them I&#39;ll also give a link to the underlying mapping source so that you can get current information.</p>
<p>If you are in the affected area and need details about flooded roads or the risk of dams or levees bursting or anything else, <strong>do not trust this weblog for current information</strong>; seek out official and up to date sources.</p>
<p>Most of the maps are dated August 30, 2012, unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p><strong>Rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for maps of observed precipitation is <a href="http://water.weather.gov" target="_self">water.weather.gov</a>, specifically the <a href="http://water.weather.gov/precip/" target="_self">AHPS</a> (Advanced Hydrometeorological Prediction Service). Here&#39;s a 7 day observed rainfall for Louisiana from that service, showing some areas with upwards of 20 inches of observed rainfall.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319049ba970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-louisiana-7-day-precipitation" /></a><br /><strong>Predicted rainfall</strong></p>
<p>A good source for rainfall predictions running out to the next 5 days (120 hours) is the <a href="http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/day1-5.shtml" target="_self">Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF).</a>&#0160;These models are updated several times a day and give rainfall estimates over the entire country. (Your rainfall will differ.) This is the run from Thursday, August 30, 2012, showing a predicted 5 day course for the remnants of Isaac to dump rain up the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-pi"><img alt="P120i00" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31904d5d970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="P120i00" /></a><strong>Predicted flooding</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Serivce <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/wwa/" target="_self">Watch, Warning, Advisory Display</a>&#0160;shows this map with areas in pale green with warnings of potential floods, darker green (Arkansas) with current flood conditions, and parts of Louisiana and Mississippi with flash flood warnings. The accompanying text for some forecasts note that because of the dry and drought conditions the ground will be hard, and thus less able to absorb moisture leading to heavy runoff and flooding.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-pi"><img alt="Picture 13" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017617877774970c-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 13" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><strong>River gauges, current</strong></p>
<p>Many rivers have flood gauges which measure and report current flood status. This is a map from water.weather.gov&#39;s River Observations page showing the whole nation, with flooding marked in color. You can zoom in to individual observations as well.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-pi"><img alt="Ahps-river-observations" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c31905265970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ahps-river-observations" /></a><br />Here&#39;s a zoom of the New Orleans area for the same data. Please note that the gauges are only on rivers, and will not show flash flood areas, levee breaches, or other places where water is not usually found.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-pi"><img alt="Picture 11" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c319054b1970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 11" /></a><br /><strong>Satellite imagery</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for satellite photos that show flooding; those usually don&#39;t appear until after the storm has cleared, because any imagery sensitive to water will pick up the clouds first. &#0160;Here&#39;s a NASA Aqua/MODIS image, pulled from their <a href="http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/near-real-time-data/rapid-response" target="_self">Rapid Response Imagery</a> datasets.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From the news release:</p>
<blockquote>The&#0160;<a href="http://thegalleryproject.com" target="_self">Gallery Project</a> presents&#0160;<em>Quantified Self</em>, a multimedia exhibit in which 34 local, regional, and national artists examine how individuals collect and often project information about themselves and others in the digital world. Artists examine the quantified self from two unique perspectives: one, how information about individuals is collected, stored, processed, and used by these individuals and communicated to others; and two how entities collect information about individuals and groups for commercial and other purposes. Examples are self-projections in cyber space, self-monitoring of health and other behaviors, obsessive collecting of self-defining artifacts, and visualizing personal and group data.</blockquote>

<p>The gallery opened today, August 30, 2012; the reception is on the evening of August 31, 2012, and I&#39;ll probably miss it. Artists that I recognized included <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/" target="_self">Edward Tufte</a> who had three very lovely prints from one of his books on display, and <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/" target="_self">Mark EJ Newman</a> who had some remarkably presented <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/" target="_self">cartograms</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Visit them at 215 S. Fourth Ave in downtown Ann Arbor, across from Eastern Accents (and thus handy to visit after A2B3).</p>
