<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <p>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on <a href="http://am1610.org" target="_self">http://am1610.org</a> . The show is &quot;The Strait&quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&#39;s always worth a listen.&#0160;</p>
<p>Some day I&#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m working on a book on the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, which is just about half done. You can see a copy on LeanPub at <a href="http://leanpub.com/michigan-foia" target="_self">http://leanpub.com/michigan-foia</a> . There are some sample chapters to download for free, or you can get the whole thing in its current draft state for a price that you choose. It&#39;s as good a time as any to let people know about it, since this week is Sunshine Week 2013.</p>
<p>Every good project deserves some inspiration.&#0160;</p>
<p>From Paul Ford, <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html">The Web Is a Customer Service Medium</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what I tell my Gutenbourgeois friends, if they&#39;ll listen. I say: Create a service experience around what you publish and sell. Whatever “customer service” means when it comes to books and authors, figure it out and do it. Do it in partnership with your readers. Turn your readers into members. Not visitors, not subscribers; you want members. And then don&#39;t just consult them, but give them tools to consult amongst themselves.&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the <a href="https://leanpub.com/manifesto">Lean Publishing manifesto</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Using the Lean Publishing approach helps you gauge reaction to your book, improve it, and judge whether you have product-market fit before pouring lots of effort into marketing the book.
</blockquote>
<p>And, most pragmatically, from Bill Tozier, who noted that his work-in-progress &quot;<a href="https://leanpub.com/pragmaticGP" target="_self">Answer Factories: The Engineering of Useful Surprises&quot;</a> already has 44 readers who have paid for the privilege of early access to the draft.</p>
<p>I hope, of course, to be done with this project at some point, and to have it be sufficiently tidy and complete and well-edited to deserve being in print and not just a draft. My understanding of the topic expands as I see other people asking questions about FOIA and where I can go back to my manuscript and see if I&#39;ve given them adequate accounts and advice. Perhaps the law changes fast enough, and my understanding of it is thin enough, that I&#39;ll have to keep this a draft for a long time just to understand the various nooks and crannies of the practical use of Freedom of Information Act requests.</p>
<p>But in any case I do have a few readers (3 to date; hopefully more to come) and I can contact them directly and I know that the effort is more than just an exercise but really a way to work in partnership with readers to write a better guide.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><p>UPDATE: &ldquo;The City of Ann Arbor’s boil water advisory for the northeast side has been lifted. Tests results have confirmed there is no contamination and the water is safe to drink.&rdquo; via Facebook</p>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>
</strong>
<p>The following is from a City of Ann Arbor press release sent through the city&rsquo;s Code Red system.</p>
<p>&mdash;-</p>
<strong>
<p>The City of Ann Arbor has issued a boil water advisory for the northeast side. This is the result of the water system being depressurized due to a city contractor conducting scheduled valve maintenance on the northeast side.&nbsp; Any time there is a loss of water system pressure, a boil-water advisory is issued as a precautionary measure.</strong></strong></p>
<strong>
</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The affected area includes South of Green Court, North of the Huron River, East of Huron Parkway and West of US-23. See the attached map for specific details.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017ee906ae80970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017ee906ae80970d" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="March072013WaterAdvisory" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017ee906ae80970d-600wi" alt="March072013WaterAdvisory" /></a><br /><br /></p>
</strong></span></div>
<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
<div>
<p>As a precautionary measure, all residents in the affected northeast area are advised to boil water that they will use for drinking or cooking. The water should be boiled for at least one minute and allowed to cool in a covered container. Bottled water may be used as an alternative to boiling. Residents may experience discolored water, which can cause stains to laundry if the discoloration is not first cleared from the lines. The iron sediment in the water main has been disturbed causing the discoloration. Once residents are notified that the boil water alert has ended, it is recommended to run cold water for several minutes and flush the toilet to clear your lines.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The City advises the residents to continue to use boiled or bottled water for drinking purposes until further notice.&nbsp; Tests of the water have begun and results will be available within 24 hours. The boil water advisory will be lifted when safe results have been obtained from the tests. Residents in the impacted area will be notified via the city’s Code Red emergency notification system.</p>
<p>Residents may use the water for showering, flushing toilets, and doing laundry. If using the dishwasher, use the heated cycle. If hand-washing dishes, use hot water.</p>
<p>This is a precautionary advisory only. There is no indication that there was any contamination.

      <p>Every so often, Arborwiki&#39;s web server gets wedged, with errors like</p>

<p>in the log files. I&#39;ve got monitoring set up to notice when this happens, but so far this has been a stumper. Apologies for the occasional downtime.</p>
<p>I&#39;m now monitoring with <a href="http://mmonit.com/monit/" target="_self">monit</a>&#0160;which if it&#39;s working correctly should automatically restart the server if it&#39;s wedged. Of course I can&#39;t yet force it to get wedged reliably, so this might take days to properly test. Still it does notice that it&#39;s currently working and tests it every so often to make sure that it does.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/localwiki/localwiki/issues/355">open issue on Github is here</a>, if you care to read the gory details.</p>

      <p>The paper is Social Resilience in Online Communities: The Autopsy of Friendster, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109" target="_self">http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s math in there which I don&#39;t understand, but this graph seems to sum it up:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b-pi"><img alt="Screen shot 2013-03-02 at 5.43.18 PM" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017c373d8ef9970b-600wi" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen shot 2013-03-02 at 5.43.18 PM" /></a><br />The thesis is that if enough of your friends drop off of a service, you will too, because you won&#39;t have anyone to talk to. Then in turn your friends who are left will start to drop off because they miss you and don&#39;t have anyone to talk to, etc.</p>
<p>A 2009 review of the new Friendster interface by a Filipino tech enthusiast, &quot;<a href="http://tech.exchange.ph/blog/animetric/2009/12/07/friendster-gets-a-facelift" target="_self">Friendster gets a facelift</a>&quot; seems to match this:</p>
<p><em>Like most Filipinos online, yes, I have a Friendster account and it was my first attempt at social networking. To be honest though, I have not logged on to my Friendster account in a year. My high school and college friends had all migrated to Facebook, and I found that I could not relate with the Friendster&#39;s younger user base.</em></p>
<p>The question I have is where will the Facebook users migrate to? Techcrunch runs a story that suggests<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/18/tumblr-is-not-what-you-think/" target="_self"> it might be Tumblr next</a>:</p>
<p><em>But Tumblr does not conform to this calculus, and the reason is that a large percentage of Tumblr users actually don’t WANT an audience. They do not want to be found, except by a few close friends who they explicitly share one of their tumblogs with. Therefore Tumblr’s notoriously weak search functionality is A-OK with most of its user base.</em></p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m slowly but surely reducing the number of people who I have listed as &quot;friends&quot; on Facebook. That doesn&#39;t mean that I have <span style="text-decoration: line-through; background-color: #ff80bf;">less</span>&#0160;<span style="background-color: #80ffff;">fewer</span>&#0160;&quot;friends&quot;, but just that I&#39;m tiring of reading updates from people who I barely know as though I were a real-life friend of theirs.</p>
<p>This ends up being a slow and tedious task since the user interface doesn&#39;t have an easy one-click unfriend from a long list - instead you have to go to each stranger-friend in turn, select a drop-down menu, and scroll to the bottom of it to make your &quot;friendship&quot; go away.</p>
<p>Of course, friendship doesn&#39;t really go away. I have fond memories from years ago of many of these people, and if I were to meet them again in person I&#39;d like to catch up. But I really kind of resent Facebook mediating the relationship and re-reminding me about people who are out of my present orbit. I&#39;d rather get some absence rather than synthetic telepresence, and try to make the heart grow fonder by giving distant relationships some of the distance they are due.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&#39;s really quite simple to open up a Hubbard squash or any other big tough squashes.</p>
<p>Put the squash in a paper bag, lift it up high, and let it drop onto a hard concrete floor. I went down to the basement and dropped it from the ceiling. Once the squash has been cracked open, it generally can be cut into further smaller pieces without much ado.&#0160;</p>
<p>The various suggestions to hit the thing with an axe, a mallet, or other sharp or blunt instrument, or even to use a knife to start the process are quite inefficient compared to the wonderful force of gravity that can be at your command in this process.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>ANN ARBOR, Saturday February 23, 2013, 7:00 p.m. - News monitored via Twitter is chaotic at the moment, with a variety of sources all confirming that there was a horrific crash on the last lap of the NASCAR race at Daytona, Florida today, injuring spectators. The various sources monitored do not agree on details of who and how many people were injured, and how serious the injuries are.</p>
<p>7:10 p.m. A news conference held by track officials states that 14 spectators were transported "off property" and 14 others were treated at the track. The site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nascar.com/presspass" target="_self">http://www.nascar.com/presspass</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>7:20 p.m. An <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/stewart-wins-daytona-after-scary-last-lap-crash" target="_self">AP story</a>&nbsp;repeats the 28 injuries number, and quotes&nbsp;Volusia County spokesman Dave Byron, reporting that "six people with serious injuries were taken by ambulance to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach."</p>
<p>7:25 p.m. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/volusiafire" target="_self">Volusia County Professional Firefighters Association</a> is reporting on Facebook, with comments mostly from people local to the area and links to news coverage.</p>
<p>7:30 p.m. <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?ctid=379" target="_self">Radio Reference for Volusia County</a> has several feeds including fire dispatch, and this alert message:</p>

A short video of the crash scene was uploaded to Youtube immediately after the crash, and then taken down on a DMCA complaint. It is not known at this point whether that was an automated system generating the takedown notice or a deliberate decision by race day officials.</p>
<p>8:10 p.m.
The Verge has updated their reporting with this statement from NASCAR re the video takedown:
<blockquote>
The fan video of the wreck on the final lap of today's NASCAR Nationwide Series race was blocked on YouTube out of respect for those injured in today's accident. Information on the status of those fans was unclear and the decision was made to err on the side of caution with this very serious incident.

Automated DMCA takedowns at Youtube are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/youtube-upgrades-its-automated-copyright-enforcement-system">tracked by the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.

      </h3>
      <p>Disclaimer: This is not a low-fat dish. But it is delicious.</p>
<p>Coconut fried rice</p>
<ul>
<li>Leftover rice</li>
<li>Coconut oil</li>
<li>Dessicated (dried) coconut flakes or powder</li>
<li>Milk (I used almond milk to make this vegan)</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat oil in pan. Add leftover rice and dried coconut flakes. Mix and stir and cook. When the mixture is hot, add some milk. Sprinkle sugar on top to taste. Stir until hot; you&#39;ll know when it&#39;s done when the dried coconut doesn&#39;t taste dry. Serve hot.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t measure quantities, but I suspect that this recipe is tolerant of a lot of variety.</p>
<p>The biggest down side is that the pan ends up sticky. My usual treatment for this in a savory dish is to deglaze the pan with red wine, but that&#39;s obviously a non-starter here. I suspect that a small amount of white wine added to the pan at the end of cooking would be worthwhile.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Originally from Kate and Lynne, this recipe depends on red lentils (not green lentils) and generally can be made with ingredients already in stock in our house. Serve with pita and labneh (if you can manage to not eat all of the pita and labneh before dinner), and with a chopped green salad with a sumac vinagrette.</p>
<h3>Middle Eastern Red Lentil Soup</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 medium yellow onion chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed</li>
<li>1 T olive oil</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 C red lentils (NOT brown)</li>
<li>8 C water</li>
<li>1 t salt</li>
<li>fresh ground pepper</li>
<li>1 T ground cumin</li>
<li>lemon juice, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>In a big pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the onion is soft. Add the lentils, water, salt, pepper and cumin and bring to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer for at least 40 minutes (more is fine--if you are going to simmer for a LONG time then put a lid on the pot so all the water doesn&#39;t evaporate). Just before serving add half the lemon juice (at least one lemon&#39;s worth) and then taste to see if you want any more lemon juice, salt or pepper.<br /><br />**If you don&#39;t have any fresh lemons in the house, bottled lemon juice will suffice.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m trying my best to track every bill that affects Freedom of Information Act laws in Michigan.</p>
<p>The method runs as follows:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/" target="_self">Michigan Legislative Website</a>, where bills and their status are shown.</p>
<p>2. Search bill text for &quot;Freedom of information&quot;.</p>
<p>3. Note with (dismay? amazement?) that 14 bills are found, 4 on the Senate side, 10 on the House side. Realize that this includes legislation that refers to FOIA laws but does not change them.</p>
<p>4. Realize that there&#39;s no time at this particular instant to read through all the bills, but that needs to be done; save this post as a draft.</p>
<p>5. Realize that even a draft should be published, and publish it, hoping that I can come back later and zero in on a speedier approach.</p>

      <p>In the early 1950s, Ann Arbor had only one public high school. A new high school was proposed and built on former University of Michigan land in the outskirts of Ann Arbor at the corner of Main Street and West Stadium Boulevard, diagonally across from the Michigan Stadium. (The land was formerly the Stadium Hills golf course.) Mahlon Buell, a physics teacher in the high school (1922-58), was an amateur photographer, and he filmed the the project from concept to completion. Buell joined long-time educator Gene D. Maybee, the principal at Tappan Junior High School (1936-70) and Ann Arbor Public School administrative employee, Gail Beaver, to narrate Buell&rsquo;s historic film. Ground was broken for the new Ann Arbor High School, now AA Pioneer HS, on Friday, June 26, 1953.</p>

<p>There was a full quota of vehicles outside the Federal Building today in Ann Arbor, including three Homeland Security SUVs and three news trucks from 2, 4, and 7. I&rsquo;m certain that more details will follow. Thanks to Bruce Vielmetti for the heads up on Twitter:</p>

      <div>
<p>Finn Brunton, U-M Assistant Professor of Information, will present &quot;<a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/node/1280591" target="_self">The Accidental Archive</a>.&quot; Brunton&#39;s talk, with the alternative title &quot;Researching criminals, otherkin, cipher anarchists, spammers and the online history that doesn&#39;t want to be kept,&quot; kicks off a new series of monthly events addressing emergent research. Light refreshments will be served.</p>
<p>Notes to follow. There&#39;s a hashtag, #MLibRes, on which a half dozen people are tracking. This is an impressionistic transcript, not a summary or tidy narrative, more notes drawn from what I remember from the time and some of my own thoughts mixed in.</p>
<p>&quot;Preservation is constant toil, entropy requires no maintenance.&quot;</p>
<p>Links are not permanent, and the scholar who depends on them persisting risks losing their research materials. Finn gave out bits of a manifesto, one of which was &quot;embrace wget&quot;.</p>
<p>The Law of the Good Neighbor, a theory of library collection shelving from Aby Warberg. <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/common_knowledge/v018/18.1.steinberg.html" target="_self">An essay of the same name by Michael Steinberg.</a></p>
<p>A discussion of Rodona Garst, a notorious spammer, and the ephemeral collections of data about her operations collected under the name <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040202002820/http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm" target="_self">Behind Enemy Lines. One such collection is on archive.org</a> so it has some hope of permanence. (but if you really want a copy, make one now)</p>
<p>Deep Blue is an institutional repository run by the University of Michigan. One notable project archived there is the Michigan Terminal System, which has original distribution tapes saved into non-ephemeral bits. Finn has been collecting tarballs of references for the works he&#39;s done, and one idea (new to him and recommended by the audience) was to put his tarballs in Deep Blue, with the right kind of dark-archive permanence that was suitable to the contents.</p>
<p>Reference to &quot;shearing layers&quot; from Stewart Brand&#39;s &quot;How buildings learn&quot;. Different parts of the system change at different speeds. <a href="http://quietbabylon.com/2011/shearing-layers-of-stuff-dematerialization-4/" target="_self">From Quiet Babylon, a discussion of shearing layers</a> looks interesting.</p>
<p>Heresies expounded: &quot;we should save everything&quot;, primarily because the Internet is all significant but to different populations. The example given is the Enron corpus, which is also a very useful spam corpus; if you discarded the spam you&#39;d have been left with something less useful. Saving everything is problematic to archivists who are used to assessing collections and picking the good parts and compiling a finding aid, rather than taking all of the unfiled materials and collecting them willy-nilly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more, but this captures the flavor of the event well; there will be a recording released.</p>
<p>Future events are Fourth Mondays. Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/UMLibRes" target="_self">UMLibRes</a> for details.</p>

<p>The building is at 401 S Division St. City records show that rental permit&nbsp;<strong>CR072626 </strong>had expired for the dwelling as of 6/1/2012, so it was being rented without a permit. This from the city "eTrakit" system. The property is marked in eTrakit is noted as been managed by Old Town Realty. This <a href="http://www.decorent.net/property/property_detail_remote.php?pid=1025" target="_self">listing</a> shows that a 1 BR unit is asking $1010 for September 2013 occupancy.</p>
