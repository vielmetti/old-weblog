<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I&#39;m trying my best to track every bill that affects Freedom of Information Act laws in Michigan.</p>
<p>The method runs as follows:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/" target="_self">Michigan Legislative Website</a>, where bills and their status are shown.</p>
<p>2. Search bill text for &quot;Freedom of information&quot;.</p>
<p>3. Note with (dismay? amazement?) that 14 bills are found, 4 on the Senate side, 10 on the House side. Realize that this includes legislation that refers to FOIA laws but does not change them.</p>
<p>4. Realize that there&#39;s no time at this particular instant to read through all the bills, but that needs to be done; save this post as a draft.</p>
<p>5. Realize that even a draft should be published, and publish it, hoping that I can come back later and zero in on a speedier approach.</p>
<p>The burden of diligence.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In the early 1950s, Ann Arbor had only one public high school. A new high school was proposed and built on former University of Michigan land in the outskirts of Ann Arbor at the corner of Main Street and West Stadium Boulevard, diagonally across from the Michigan Stadium. (The land was formerly the Stadium Hills golf course.) Mahlon Buell, a physics teacher in the high school (1922-58), was an amateur photographer, and he filmed the the project from concept to completion. Buell joined long-time educator Gene D. Maybee, the principal at Tappan Junior High School (1936-70) and Ann Arbor Public School administrative employee, Gail Beaver, to narrate Buell&rsquo;s historic film. Ground was broken for the new Ann Arbor High School, now AA Pioneer HS, on Friday, June 26, 1953.</p>

<p>Hathaway negotiated a guilty plea with federal prosecutors and waived her right to indictment or trial.

      </h3>
      <div>
<p>Finn Brunton, U-M Assistant Professor of Information, will present &quot;<a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/node/1280591" target="_self">The Accidental Archive</a>.&quot; Brunton&#39;s talk, with the alternative title &quot;Researching criminals, otherkin, cipher anarchists, spammers and the online history that doesn&#39;t want to be kept,&quot; kicks off a new series of monthly events addressing emergent research. Light refreshments will be served.</p>
<p>Notes to follow. There&#39;s a hashtag, #MLibRes, on which a half dozen people are tracking. This is an impressionistic transcript, not a summary or tidy narrative, more notes drawn from what I remember from the time and some of my own thoughts mixed in.</p>
<p>&quot;Preservation is constant toil, entropy requires no maintenance.&quot;</p>
<p>Links are not permanent, and the scholar who depends on them persisting risks losing their research materials. Finn gave out bits of a manifesto, one of which was &quot;embrace wget&quot;.</p>
<p>The Law of the Good Neighbor, a theory of library collection shelving from Aby Warberg. <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/common_knowledge/v018/18.1.steinberg.html" target="_self">An essay of the same name by Michael Steinberg.</a></p>
<p>A discussion of Rodona Garst, a notorious spammer, and the ephemeral collections of data about her operations collected under the name <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040202002820/http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm" target="_self">Behind Enemy Lines. One such collection is on archive.org</a> so it has some hope of permanence. (but if you really want a copy, make one now)</p>
<p>Deep Blue is an institutional repository run by the University of Michigan. One notable project archived there is the Michigan Terminal System, which has original distribution tapes saved into non-ephemeral bits. Finn has been collecting tarballs of references for the works he&#39;s done, and one idea (new to him and recommended by the audience) was to put his tarballs in Deep Blue, with the right kind of dark-archive permanence that was suitable to the contents.</p>
<p>Reference to &quot;shearing layers&quot; from Stewart Brand&#39;s &quot;How buildings learn&quot;. Different parts of the system change at different speeds. <a href="http://quietbabylon.com/2011/shearing-layers-of-stuff-dematerialization-4/" target="_self">From Quiet Babylon, a discussion of shearing layers</a> looks interesting.</p>
<p>Heresies expounded: &quot;we should save everything&quot;, primarily because the Internet is all significant but to different populations. The example given is the Enron corpus, which is also a very useful spam corpus; if you discarded the spam you&#39;d have been left with something less useful. Saving everything is problematic to archivists who are used to assessing collections and picking the good parts and compiling a finding aid, rather than taking all of the unfiled materials and collecting them willy-nilly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s more, but this captures the flavor of the event well; there will be a recording released.</p>
<p>Future events are Fourth Mondays. Follow @<a href="https://twitter.com/UMLibRes" target="_self">UMLibRes</a> for details.</p>

<p>The building is at 401 S Division St. City records show that rental permit&nbsp;<strong>CR072626 </strong>had expired for the dwelling as of 6/1/2012, so it was being rented without a permit. This from the city "eTrakit" system. The property is marked in eTrakit is noted as been managed by Old Town Realty.

<p>I asked people how they stayed warm. They dress in layers, use solar thermal heating, wear sweaters, wear hats, huddle under electric blankets, and all manner of good adaptive Michigan behavior.</p>
<p>Some events coming up, each of which features some a2b3 group member. Some details elided in the interests of brevity, click to links for more details.</p>
<p>Already happened: Linda Diane Feldt spoke at Crazy Wisdom about the liver. &quot;The liver is the largest and most critical organ for detoxifying the blood, moving lymph, and processing food and storing nutrients. I&#39;m in awe of how well it functions, and how much it does.&quot; About 18 people were at the event.</p>
<p>Friday night 1/24/13 is David Bloom and Friends playing lounge-jazz standards at Chelsea&#39;s &quot;Back to the Roots&quot; cafe, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/188090337997019/" target="_self">details on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Thursday 1/31/13 2-8p at Burton Manor in Livonia is ACE &#39;13, the Annual Collaboration for Entrepreneurs. <a href="http://ace-event.org/" target="_self">Details on their web site</a>; volunteer opportunities are available which I&#39;m happy to help you track down if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<p>Saturday 2/16/13 10a-noon at Eastern Accents is the 4th Death Cafe, led by Merilynne Rush. <a href="http://www.deathcafe.com/2013/01/3rd-ann-arbor-death-cafe.html" target="_self">Notes on the 3d meeting are here</a> with contact info and more details.</p>
<p>Wednesday 2/27/13 from 7pm to 8:30pm in the Multi-Purpose Room is Dan Romanchik about how to self-publish e-books, based on his experience with writing books on amateur radio. <a href="http://www.aadl.org/events/list?id=17403" target="_self">Event details</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for coming!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-21-contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager/">Contactually, an early review of this contact manager</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m on a 30 day trial of <a href="http://www.contactually.com"
target="_self">Contactually</a>, a contact manager that seems to
handle one important function only: reminding you to follow up
periodically with people who are important to you.</p>

<p>On the plus side, it does a good job of importing data from my
Google account and from a handful of social media sites, and by
doing so the amount of manual labor needed to do something with it
is kept to a minimum. New contacts are created by it watching your
inbox.</p>

<p>On the minus side, its sense of creating reminders depends on
creating buckets of similar contacts to be reminded on a similar
schedule, and the process of putting a living, breathing, complex
human being into exactly one bucket is difficult if not impossible
to do completely. They try to make a game of it, which at least
lets you speed through decisions, but it&rsquo;s still a difficult
task.</p>

<p>Once you have someone in a bucket it pulls a few of
them out of that bucket every so often and reminds you to follow
up with them. You can mark someone as followed up via email or
through some other method, so it will keep track of phone calls or
in-person meetings or whatever if you need to.</p>

<p>When I used to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_ACT!" target="_self">ACT</a>!, once upon a long time ago, I was better at following up with people because I kept track of when I last contacted people. I&#39;m always surprised that native contact managers don&#39;t have a field that they keep updated for &quot;last contacted&quot; that can easily be sorted and will automatically be populated from other things that the system knows. ACT! never made it into my Internet world successfully, but I still remember its ideas.&#0160;</p>

<p>Contactually is interesting, in the way that every single new contact manager is interesting. The price point is $0/mo (for a cut-down version), $20/mo (for what I have now), and $99/mo/user (for an enterprise version that I have no interest in). At $20/mo I had better be able to point to $1000/mo in new value coming from this, and based on the experience to date, I can&#39;t say yet that it&#39;s worthwhile to me at that price point. But I like the idea - hey, let your computer unearth some long-lost friends to remind you to chat with from time to time! I&#39;m just not sure that I couldn&#39;t get the same results by taking my contact list, putting it in a file, and then generating a <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools/blob/master/randomline" target="_self">random line in the file</a> to inspire me.</p>

<p>In this lecture on &quot;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Syndicate,&quot; speaker Jon Udell will review a case study — conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere — that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.</p>
<p>Udell is an author, information architect, software developer, and new media innovator. In 2007 Udell joined Microsoft Research as a writer, interviewer, speaker, and experimental software developer. Currently he is building and explaining a calendar network that&#39;s based on open standards and runs in the Windows Azure cloud.</p>
<p>His 1999 book,&#0160;<em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>, helped lay the foundation for what we now call social software. Udell was formerly a software developer at Lotus,&#0160;<em>BYTE</em>&#0160;magazine&#39;s executive editor and Web maven, and an independent consultant.</p>
<p>A hands-on thinker, Udell&#39;s analysis of industry trends has always been informed by his own ongoing experiments with software, information architecture, and new media.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2006 he was&#0160;<em>InfoWorld&#39;s</em>&#0160;lead analyst, author of the weekly Strategic Developer column, and blogger-in-chief. During his&#0160;<em>InfoWorld</em>&#0160;tenure he also pioneered the medium now known as screencasting and produced an audio show, Interviews with Innovators.</p>
<p>Udell provided the following abstract:</p>
<p>&quot;In&#0160;<em>Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read</em>&#0160;(1955), Rudolf Flesch ranted that &#39;horrible, stupid, emasculated, pointless, tasteless little readers&#39; were depriving kids of &#39;<em>Andersen&#39;s Fairy Tales</em>&#0160;and&#0160;<em>The Arabian Nights</em>&#0160;and Mark Twain, and anything interesting and worthwhile.&#39; He&#0160; argued: &#39;If you equip kids with the right conceptual tools they can read anything.&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;As we colonize the cloud we can read — and write — in important new ways. But we&#39;re failing to equip most people with the right conceptual tools for these emerging modes of literacy. A web of connected information systems entails such concepts as authority over data, indirection, standard ways to structure and exchange data, controlled vocabularies, publish-and-subscribe networks, and use and recombination of services.</p>
<p>&quot;Students of the computer and information sciences learn and apply these principles. Others can too, but because they mostly don&#39;t they remain stuck at a &#39;Fun with Dick and Jane&#39; level of Web literacy.</p>
<p>&quot;In this talk we&#39;ll review a case study, conducted in Ann Arbor and elsewhere, that uses the syndication of public calendars to explore what people do and don&#39;t understand about the Web&#39;s core principles, how we can enlarge that understanding, and why it matters that we do.&quot;</p>

      </h3>
      <p>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013.</p>
<p>From NPR, the FAA is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/16/169555027/faa-grounds-all-787-planes-in-the-u-s-to-seek-a-fix-for-battery-issue" target="_self">grounding 787s because of battery problems</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston.</em></p>
<p>What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020149011_787batterydamagexml.html" target="_self">according to the Seattle Times</a>:</p>
<p><em>Hot chemicals sprayed out of the battery on the 787 Dreamliner in this week’s emergency landing in Japan, leaving a gooey dark residue and suggesting a different malfunction than last week’s 787 battery fire in Boston, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21054089" target="_self">BBC</a>&#0160;gives the detail in a timeline:</p>
<p><em><strong>15 January:</strong>&#0160;ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube is forced to land shortly after take-off due to battery problems. The airline grounds all its 17 Dreamliners. Japan Airlines follows suit, grounding its fleet of seven 787s</em></p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.piersystem.com/external/content/document/1914/1683411/1/SJC%20ANA%20update.pdf" target="_self">more detail from the San Jose airport</a>, which has flights affected by the cancellations:</p>
<p>Statement from ANA released 1/16/13: <br />ANA flight NH 692 from Yamaguchi Ube to Haneda made an emergency landing at Takamatsu <br />Airport at 8.47am on Wednesday, 16 January due to a technical problem. The aircraft’s <br />instruments registered a problem related to a battery and crew also detected an unusual smell in <br />the cabin and the cockpit. All 137 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft. The <br />event was registered as a serious incident by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and <br />Tourism (MLIT). ANA will cooperate fully with the Japan Transport Safety Board, relevant <br />authorities, and Boeing to investigate the cause of the incident. All ANA flights operated by <br />Boeing 787 have been cancelled on 16 January 2013. <br />January 16, 2013<br />All Nippon Airways, Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Reuters notes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS_Yuasa" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="GS Yuasa">GS Yuasa</a> makes the battery, and its stock took a hit. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-boeing-dreamliner-gsyuasabre90g01h-20130116,0,6174042.story" target="_self">Reuters via Chicago Tribune</a>:</p>
<p><em>TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of GS Yuasa Corp shed 5.9 percent to 302 yen on Thursday after All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said the main battery on the <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BA" rel="googlefinance" target="_blank" title="NYSE: BA">Boeing</a>&#39;s 787 Dreamliner that made an emergency landing on Wednesday was discolored and there were signs of leakage.</em></p>
<p>In happier times, here was the press release about the Lithium ion batteries from GS Yuasa:</p>
<p><em>June 12, 2005, Thales will incorporate the latest lithium-ion technology from Japan’s leading battery manufacturer, GS Yuasa, in the Electrical Power Conversion System of Boeing’s next generation commercial airliner, the 787 Dreamliner. The multi-year, multi-million dollar contract is a historic first as it marks the first commercial aviation application of Li-ion technology anywhere in the world.</em></p>
<p>And, after a bunch of digging, here&#39;s a really good analysis of <a href="http://www.avweb.com/blogs/insider/AVwebInsider_DreamlinerFire_207979-1.html" target="_self">The Dreamliner&#39;s Battery Fire</a>, by Paul Bertorelli on AVweb. Worth reading through the whole thing for an insight into why this is a big issue for Boeing. Emphasis added.</p>
<p><em>This is serious stuff for Boeing and could put a significant dent in the airplane&#39;s certification basis if they can&#39;t figure out a solution. When Boeing proposed the Dreamliner a decade ago, it spec&#39;d lithium-ion batteries for the airplane&#39;s innovative electrical power conversion system, which is made by Thales, with batteries from Yuasa. The airplane can also use conventional NiCad cells but either way, batteries provide starting energy for the APU and back-up power for other systems. At the time, the hazards of Li-ion were known, but Boeing wanted the weight savings and power density that only Li-ion can offer. Working with the FAA, it developed new certification standards for batteries under so-called special conditions. That required sophisticated electronics to provide overcharge and charge imbalance protection and physical thermal containment. Taken together and on paper, those precautions look more than robust enough to meet the stringent safety requirements of a modern airliner.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Well, maybe not</strong>. When I was researching Li-ion batteries for aircraft last year, I heard real concerns that the Li-ion main ship/starting battery risk wasn&#39;t yet well understood.&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>

<p>My current workflow admits multiple patterns for doing this, and I suspect that the answer to my question is to do more than one save, depending on how important it is to save something. I&#39;ll take them in order.</p>
<p>1. Write something down in my blog. There&#39;s only about 2000 posts here, which is much smaller than the size of the net, and so I should be able to refind it if I&#39;ve blogged about it. The corresponding search is either a keyword search through Google with the refinement &quot;site:vielmetti.typepad.com&quot; or a search through the Typepad dashboard back end.</p>
<p>2. Save it to Pinboard. (Previously, this would have been save it to Delicious). I have about 18000 bookmarks there, mostly from a couple of years ago, and many of them have good tags and good text to search through. Pinboard is a rich source of the sort of stuff I like, but retrieval depends on carefully grooming the tags you apply every time you get back a search.</p>
<p>3. Post to Twitter. Twitter&#39;s searching tools are lousy, but I have about 3000 followers, and if I send out anything good chances are someone else will remember it. Twitter is promising a personal search and when they get it the system will seem less write-mostly and will help me figure out which sandwiches I like and which buses have squeaky brakes. As a bonus, my Twitter posts are being archived to Pinboard so there&#39;s a fighting chance I can look it up again there.</p>
<p>4. Post to Facebook. Facebook seems to be write-mostly, read-little, but again there&#39;s the ever-promising search improvements that will support unlikely syntaxes like &quot;people who like sandwiches who live near Oshkosh&quot;. If I ever need to do a search like that, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find it.</p>
<p>5. Save to Evernote. I only have a tiny amount of stuff there, but it&#39;s saving full text of things more so than just pointers, and so the search experience is richer. I wonder if I can coerce Pinboard to do more things so that I&#39;m less tempted by Evernote.</p>
<p>6. Write on Arborwiki, or some other narrowly focused wiki. This works best for things you want to remember that don&#39;t have to have your name attached to it. If I&#39;m salting away details about the local environment, Arborwiki has about 10000 existing pages to add to, and that&#39;s enough to make it worthwhile to make incremental improvements to.</p>
<p>The common elements here seem to be scale - a system is appealing when it has at least a few thousand elements already in it, but not so huge like Wikipedia where any individual contribution is washed out by the enormity of the whole. It&#39;s nice to have non-Google places to put things where the search language and syntax has a bit more finesse, especially if there&#39;s a backup plan to use Google as well.&#0160;</p>

      <p>Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &quot;social graph&quot;. <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/130115/p31#a130115p31" target="_self">Techmeme&#39;s front page</a> has plenty of commentary.</p>
<p>I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled.</p>
<p>Then, when you want to surprise someone with a plausible association, or bring someone to mind who had been lost to mind, you shuffle the rolodex and unearth the connections that had disappeared but that because of your graph will reappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course &quot;rolodex&quot; will never show up in a Facebook press release, and the fact that I even mention it makes me look old.</p>

      <p>ANN ARBOR (January 13, 2013, 11:06 pm) - A fire at a 6 unit apartment building at 1310 Packard in Ann Arbor sent 6 people to the hospital, all in stable condition, <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290656100750073856" target="_self">according to a report</a> from Michigan Daily reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam" target="_self">Sam Gringlas</a> who is on the scene and who spoke with Huron Valley Ambulance spokeswoman Joyce Williams. A <a href="https://twitter.com/gringsam/status/290646279883718656/photo/1" target="_self">photograph</a> from the reporter shows smoke billowing out of a window.</p>
<p>At 9:13 p.m. the fire was reportedly &quot;fully involved&quot;, and fire dispatch (monitored via scanner) called for mutual aid assistance. Units from multiple neighboring jurisdictions including Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township came to the scene.</p>
<p>Packard is blocked between Wells and Brooklyn, and motorists should seek alternative routes.</p>
<p>The building was <a href="http://www.commercialiq.com/listing/2378234" target="_self">listed for sale</a>, with an asking price of $550,000, on CommercialIQ.</p>
<p>The building is owned by The High-way Company Interational LLC,&#0160;Bashar J Abdulsattar as registered agent.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system.</p>
<p>Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &quot;item&quot;) and the subsequent responses. Items and responses have numbers, so that you can refer unambiguously to 6:23 and someone can go back and read that. Conferences have names, and membership in a conference is controlled down to the individual level if the organizer so desires.</p>
<p>A typical Confer conference either had a very narrow, focused point of view with a set of people trying to tackle some specific issue, or a general point of view open to all comers with very little restriction on the topics. A conference might be open ended, or it could be shut down after a decided on period of time when the work was concluded.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use weblogs like Confer, sorta kinda, but they give relatively too much power to the blog owner (the person who authors posts, or &quot;items&quot;) in shaping the discussion. My words are always at the top of the page, which doesn&#39;t always make for good dialog. Group blogs help somewhat, though there&#39;s still an editorial focus that doesn&#39;t feel like a conference.</p>
<p>Private Facebook groups, especially those that are carefully tended, come closer to Confer behavior. You have the same item and response structure, and a similar level of control over who participates. The biggest issue is that old Facebook posts scroll off into the mists of time, and it&#39;s hard to have a lot of conversations going on at once without overwhelming the board. This contrasts with Confer where judicious use of the &quot;forget&quot; command could keep one noisy item from overwhelming the whole thing.</p>
<p>Finally, of all things, the Github &quot;issues&quot; board has a very similar structure to Confer, with items (&quot;issues&quot;) and responses neatly threaded. It has some of the less-used abilities of Confer to categorize and organize items, plus a well thought-out cross reference facility so that a link to another issue is easy to turn into something that you can click through.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve gone from an era of computing scarcity to an era of embarrassing plenty.&#0160;What&#39;s missing from everything is the sense that this mainframe that you were typing at was the only thing that was absorbing everyone&#39;s online attention, and that there really wasn&#39;t anything else that had the same density of local contacts and connections. The Internet is chockablock with online discussion and sharing systems looking to capture a piece of your daily energy, with more coming all the time. The era of the centralized mainframe with the centralized discussion board is over, no matter how compelling the features of its time seemed to be.&#0160;</p>

      <p>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)</p>
<p>This week&#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college. The answers ranged from selling pots and pans door to door to selling ice cream in Manhattan to running a student bus company to programming PDP-8 computers. One person was there who was in college now and he talked about his startup that connects bands with bars.</p>
<p>The technology of the week was the notice that <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michiganterminalsystem/discussions/mts-today/6mtsrunningonaraspberrypi" target="_self">the Michigan Terminal System has been made to work on the ultra-small Raspberry Pi system</a>. A photo shows the setup.</p>

<p>Organizing an event that happens every week is easy, especially when the venue is open. All you have to do is show up every single week, invite anyone you can find, and make sure that if someone arrives twice that you remember their name. It helps if you happen to be part of a community where people have learned to communicate online for a long time, and where the online community and the in-person community dovetail nicely.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Connecting William Street is a redevelopment project that the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is working on to make better use of properties which are currently surface parking lots. The grand plan envisions relatively dense development on these lots.</p>
<p>For background reading see the <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/current_projects/a2p5_/" target="_self">DDA site for Connecting William Street</a>, the <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/tag/Connecting%20William%20Street/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com coverage of Connecting William Street</a>, and &#0160;the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/tag/connecting-william-street/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle coverage of Connecting William Street</a>. If you&#39;re coming at it from scratch, expect to spend about an hour chewing on the debates to date. Or, you could be like most people and not really care to read every excruciating detail of every minor functionary&#39;s opinions on the project, and every excruciating opinion from the pseudonymous commenter crowd. </p>
<p>William Street is not a fun street to walk down, especially compared to Liberty Street one block over. There&#39;s not a density of retail that makes window shopping appealing, and two entire blocks are given over to parking. The question is whether municipal intervention in the planning process can enliven this area and at the same time generate a return on the investment in the land that&#39;s better than what parking can provide.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with William Street, and one that no easy planning process can address, is the horrible car-pedestrian interface at the Fourth and William parking structure. Cars enter and exit to the sidewalk without much in the way of sight lines to help avoid collisions, and it&#39;s a busy enough structure that if you go from Main to Fourth past the structure you&#39;re bound to have to make a quick step to preserve your good health. No matter what else you do with all of the other properties, there&#39;s still going to be a barrier that separates Main Street from points to the east, and anyone with a choice as to where to walk is going to detour towards Liberty.</p>
<p>Build all you want, but the giant hulk of a parking structure smack in the middle of your development effort is going to overshadow any attempts you make to build a pleasant streetscape.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m irritated when so-called newspapers fill their pages by rewriting stories from other newspapers. It&#39;s worst when the rewrite is as long as the original and contains no new reporting, just regurgitage.</p>
<p>A typical example:</p>
<p><a href="http://dexter.patch.com/articles/dexter-township-permanent-fire-station-on-hold-while-board-discusses-alternate-land-option" target="_self">Dexter Patch writes a story</a> about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station. <a href="http://annarbor.com/news/dexter/plans-for-permanent-fire-substation-on-hold-in-dexter-township-after-property-sold/" target="_self">AnnArbor.com follows up with the same story</a>, too lazy even to call any of the officials named in the story to get its own quote.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not an unusual day to see fully half of the &quot;news&quot; in AnnArbor.com being cribbed from some other source.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-02-what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet/">What is the goal of the Internet?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Let&#39;s assume for a moment that the Internet is a very large, elaborate, multi-player game. What are its winning conditions?
<p>
0. Make money fast. That proves to be difficult, but it&#39;s been pitched so many times that it should go up front first. If you can&#39;t make money quickly, then at least make the promise that you are growing something that will eventually make money even if it&#39;s not making money now.</p>
<p>
1. Increase the n. Find something of desire, and add to it. Games built into social network services (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter) behave this way, all in somewhat different details but all measured by simple increases in how many things you collect. Lots of systems have naive but effective ways of prompting you to continue simply by helping you count how much you have played so far.</p>
<p>
2. Reduce the hop count. This is a network game players point of view, most easily visible to those with experience playing in the UUCP and Internet routing networks, but also to a certain degree on high-degree social networks. Find something far away of desire, and work systematically to bring it closer. For an added bonus, make the online equivalent of a back stage pass that quickly gets you access to a sense of intimacy that you would otherwise have to earn.</p>
<p>
3. Decrease the n. Like Sisyphus, we work to reduce the size of our inbox daily. The seasonal holiday of Discardia is a good time to do a purge of whatever we no longer treasure, to make room for the things that are awesome. Good writing includes good editing, which means omitting needless words. At a social extreme are the deletionist Wikipedians, who believe that a better encyclopedia doesn&#39;t include marginal and unimportant articles.</p>
<p>
4. Reduce mean time to response. A well developed network gets a prompt, smart, generous response to queries. That&#39;s hard to keep up 24x7, but when you are on you can be exceptional in your ability to gain trust. &quot;The courtesy of a prompt response is appreciated.&quot;</p>
<p>
5. Increase bandwidth. It&#39;s always better to have more bits streaming in, even if you aren&#39;t using them all at once. The same goes for screen size and screen resolution - you can never have enough.</p>
<p>
6. Reduce latency and lag. From first-person shooters to international video chat, lag and latency are your enemy. Work as hard as possible to trim milliseconds from your enviroment so that you can enjoy it in real time.</p>
<p>
7. Increase the size of the lunch table. If you are having lunch with friends, you want the size of the table to fill the venue without overflowing. The restaurant will love you if you keep it full, and you&#39;ll have that many more people to appreciate and think of.</p>
<p>
8. Collect badges and prizes. Amassing credentials is a part of any good game, whether it be Foursquare mayorships at the local cafe or college degrees or professional certificates. Play the game until you prove that you have won it.</p>
<p>9. Be the first to experience something. Whether it&#39;s making the first comment on a post, writing the first review of a new product, or going to a restaurant on opening night, the person who has the quick draw on the hot new item wins. There&#39;s a benefit for novelty and being part of the in crowd that knows what&#39;s new.</p>
<p>10. Outlast your rivals. Slow, plodding diligence is enough to win some races, where you simply wait for your counterparts to give up on the game that you&#39;re playing. Your ability to keep at a task year upon year means that eventually your gray hair will be a mark of your genius, just because there&#39;s no one else around to challenge your version of the story.</p></p>
