      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-09-22-very-rare-south/">Very rare southern black widow spider bite in Michigan</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (<span class="normal"><a href="http://insects.tamu.edu/fieldguide/cimg368.html"><em>Latrodectus mactans</em> Fabricius</a>) </span>on September 7, 2008.&nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System's Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.</p>

<p>The best news article on this is from the <a href="http://www.thedailynews.cc/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=2&amp;ArticleID=22139">Greenville, MI Daily News</a>, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.&nbsp; A quote from this article:</p><blockquote><p>Doug Reeves,
assistant chief of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources'
Wildlife Division, said he's seen about seven northern black widows,
&quot;usually when I'm digging around woodpiles.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They're not particularly rare but they're not something that's found, unless you look in the right habitat,&quot; Reeves said.<br /><br />Doctors told Gregory that his was one of only one or two southern black widow bites ever recorded in Michigan.<br /><br />&quot;They told him he would have a much better chance of winning the lottery,&quot; Margaret Gregory said.<br /><br />Reeves
said he'd never before heard of a southern black widow bite in the
state. However, Reeves said he's heard of other cases where non-native
spiders and snakes have come into the state through international
shipments, as was the case with Brad Gregory and his southern black
widow.</p></blockquote><p>The southern black widow spider is not a common Michigan spider.</p>

<p><a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Latrodectus_mactans.html">Latrodectus mactans on the Animal Diversity Web</a>, a good survey, on its habitat:</p><blockquote><p>A terrestrial environment is the habitat of the <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>.
It is ubiquitous and builds strong-walled retreats quite close to the
ground and in dark sheltered spots. However, it also spreads its snares
over plants. Webs of the black widow spider can be found in recesses
under stones or logs in a woodpile, in crevices or holes in dirt
embankments, in barns and outbuildings. They can also be found around
lids of dust bins, around seats of outdoor privies, spaces under chips
of wood, around stacked materials of any kind, in deserted animal
burrows or rodent holes, and entwined in grape arbors. This spider may
find its way into clothing or shoes and occasionally seeks a spot in a
house to build a web, but it is usually not found indoors. When it does
seek shelter in a building, it is due to cold weather and a need for a
dry shelter. In addition, in the eastern United States, <span class="taxon_link_sp" name="Latrodectus mactans">Latrodectus mactans</span>
is associated with littered areas, with dumps of large cities, with
garages, and storage sheds. In arid parts of Arizona, this spider
inhabits almost every crevice in the soil and its nests are found in
cholla cacti and agave plants. (Ferrand, 1988; Kaston, 1953;

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-09-12-bunny-biscuit-b/">bunny biscuit brief</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn't find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;bunny cutter&quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference.&nbsp; You should be able to find these things everywhere once Easter rolls around; just in case you can't for some reason, <a href="http://www.shopbakersnook.com/221.html">here's a good sized selection for sale.</a></p>

<p>I'll note, just for my own embarrassment, two things about this recipe.&nbsp; First, though it calls for some baking soda, you would be foolish to do (as I did exactly one time) to use exclusively baking soda instead of baking powder as measured; bleah is all I need to say.&nbsp; Second, though it calls for 5 Tbsp of oil, I can say from somewhat sheepish experience that it will also work with no oil, and still tasted pretty good.</p>

<p>Bunny biscuits are usually on the menu when we make soup; this week's soup was a &quot;white beans and whatever else was around&quot; assembly, which turned out pretty good.&nbsp; It's hard not to have a good soup when you have so many good tomatoes.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Do first before your hands get sticky: Take out ingredients, measuring
cups, cookie sheet fork, measuring spoons, bunny cutter, sheet of wax
paper.&nbsp; Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</p>

<p>
In big metal mixing bowl measure:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup whole wheat flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup white flour<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.5 tsp baking powder<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp baking soda<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 tsp salt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Tbsp sugar</p>

<p>
Mix all this up with a fork.</p>

<p>
Add:&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 Tbsp canola oil</p>

<p>
Mix again with a fork.</p>

<p>
In the 1c glass measuring cup, mix (approx):<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup yogurt<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/8 cup milk</p>

<p>
Stir until it's uniform.</p>

<p>
Add to metal mixing bowl.&nbsp; Mix with fork until it's a more or less
uniform consistency. Put wax paper on a big surface and coat with
flour.&nbsp; Turn out dough, knead ten times.&nbsp; Pat out until .75&quot; thick.
 Cut out biscuits, handling as little as possible.&nbsp; Place on ungreased
cookie sheet, bake 12 minutes, remove immediately.</p>

<p>
Mwah!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Merlin Mann has relaunched <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a>; he doesn't want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&nbsp; It's a good choice.</p>

<p>He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish.&nbsp; (Or something like that; it probably overstates the issue.)&nbsp; And he bemoans the tendency of people to consume an endless stream of shitty first drafts as if that was the only thing worth doing:</p><blockquote><p>What worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of
fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of <em>everything</em>.
I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of
it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.&nbsp; (from <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better">better)</a></p></blockquote><p>Since this post itself is a shitty first draft of a summary of what is probably 100 other things I've thought about, I'll keep it short.&nbsp; Sometimes, when you want to have deep insight into a topic, you have to immerse yourself in the details.&nbsp; Your makebelieve insight and fake-connectedness are exercises in helping you understand the world, and even though sometimes the explanation that comes up doesn't really sound any more insightful than what your wikipedia-quoting eight year old can come up with, it came from you.&nbsp; Sometimes, if you are really lucky, you get to reflect on a bunch of first drafts and turn them into second and third drafts - hurray!&nbsp; But at least you got that thinking out into public in a format that can get some feedback.&nbsp; The best way to have one good idea is to have a thousand ideas.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of a series on <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/reminder_systems">reminder systems.</a></p>

<p>--</p>

<p>One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head.</p>

<p>As an example of this (not the only example), there is a system developed at the University of Michigan called ClinfoTracker.&nbsp; &nbsp;It uses information from patient healthcare records to remind patients and medical staff of expected upcoming dates for appointments and tests, and to remind doctors that if a test has not been completed that they should re-request it.&nbsp; This complex data and protocol driven reminder scheduling is way beyond the postcard you get from your dentist, and as such it can provide some considerable addition support in working with people who may not remember all of the things that need to happen in the future.&nbsp; Quoting now <a href="http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=609">from a press release from the UMHS</a>:</p><blockquote><div>“We felt there was a need to develop a reminder and tracking
system that could be generalized in very distinct, diverse practices.
We found the ClinfoTracker system could fit relatively easily into
routine patient care flow and was easy to implement into a practice,”
says study author Donald Nease, M.D., associate professor of <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/fammed/">family medicine </a>at the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/medschool/">U-M Medical School </a>and co-creator of ClinfoTracker.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The greatest improvements in screening rates occurred at practices
that were more technologically savvy and practices where employees were
more adaptable and worked well together.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Initially, ClinfoTracker was developed to help doctors track
patients’ clinical problems and preventive care over time. The software
can also assist with chronic care, such as diabetes testing, as well as
with cancer screenings and other routine tests.</div></blockquote>



<p><a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/clinfotracker/home">The ClinfoTracker site describes the operation at the clinical level:</a></p><blockquote><p>Specifically, Cielo Clinic provides the clinician with a one sheet
clinical summary (Encounter Form) that includes chronic and active
problems, and needed services. Services that a patient might be
eligible for are based on their age, gender and/or clinical problems.
Following the principle that clinicians should only be prompted when
necessary, prior to the visit, Clinic scans billing, lab and radiology
databases to determine if an eligible service is up to date. If it is,
clinicians are not prompted to perform it.
</p>

<p>During the patient visit, the clinician markes updates to the
problem list on the Encounter Form, and checks the appropriate boxes
next to the prompted services. Services may be marked as having been
&quot;Done&quot;, &quot;Discussed&quot;, &quot;Ordered&quot;, &quot;Patient refused&quot;, &quot;Not a candidate&quot;,
or &quot;Not addressed.&quot; In this way, clinicians have flexibility in
indicating how the prompt has been addressed, or whether the prompt is
appropriate. For example, &quot;Not a candidate&quot; might be checked for a
patient that is flagged as needing a pap smear, but has had a
hysterectomy. This removes the prompt. A &quot;Patient refused&quot; check
removes the prompt for one year.</p></blockquote><p>The U of Michigan system is one of several such systems that use the phrase &quot;clinical reminder system&quot;.&nbsp; Some others include:</p>

<p><a href="http://crs.heinz.cmu.edu/">The Clinical Reminder System</a> is a project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and the West Penn Allegheny Health System:</p><blockquote><p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 0.8em;">The Clinical 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reminder System is a prototype Decision Support System that combines a 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;relational database, a knowledge base consisting of algorithms that 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;implement disease management guidelines, integration with hospital 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;information systems and a web-based interface allowing for physician 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;management of patient data and suggested medical responses. It is a joint 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;research project of The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University and The 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Department of Medicine at The West Penn Allegheny Health System. This 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;application has been in use within a clinical setting since 2001.</span></p></blockquote><p>There is a similar system in place at the VA hospitals; here's<a href="http://www.jamia.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/438"> a review showing barriers to adoption: (Saleem and Asch, 2005)</a></p><blockquote><p>Optimally using the CR system for its intended purpose<sup>&nbsp;</sup>was impeded by (1) lack of coordination between nurses and providers;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(2) using the reminders while not with the patient, impairing<sup>&nbsp;</sup>data acquisition and/or implementation of recommended actions;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(3) workload; (4) lack of CR flexibility; and (5) poor interface<sup>&nbsp;</sup>usability. Facilitators included (1) limiting the number of<sup>&nbsp;</sup>reminders at a site; (2) strategic location of the computer<sup>&nbsp;</sup>workstations; (3) integration of reminders into workflow; and<sup>&nbsp;</sup>(4) the ability to document system problems and receive prompt<sup>&nbsp;</sup>administrator feedback.</p></blockquote><p>This set of tools uses &quot;reminder system&quot; as a part of a &quot;decision support system&quot; (both of which are lovely sets of words with a bunch of coded history and software tied around them).</p>

<p>One good contact in the Ann Arbor area is <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/faculty/profile.cfm?uniqname=kzheng">Kai Zheng</a> who teaches a course, <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/iscr/caid/display_course.cfm?CourseID=HMP668">Introduction to Health Informatics</a>, which covers this and other topics.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.</p>

<p>This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page.</p>

<p>On the spam fighting front, your choice of platform matters a lot.&nbsp; I've been happy with Typepad's service, though it lets a few things go by the admin tools make it possible to unpublish something fairly quickly.&nbsp; People using Wordpress use its default Akismet tool with good success.&nbsp; If your comment tool doesn't aggressively screen for spam, you need a better system.&nbsp; In many cases, Trackback is a source of spam as well; I ended up completely blocking that just to save the hassle.</p>

<p>There's a huge and messy market in fake comments, helped by systems like Amazon's Mechanical Turk that anonymize the payments for them.&nbsp; Every so often the fake commenter actually has something marginally interesting to say, so I tend to let those through but rewrite the target URL of their post to remove the commercial value from it.&nbsp; Life is too short to live with commenter bots.</p>

<p>When on the odd chance that you have an angry, abusive critic aimed at you - the sort of person who would scribble profanities or spew personal attacks - the only reasonable remedy is to remove the text.&nbsp; Ideally, you do that without acknowledging it, or if it's important for context to keep some fragment of it around, a traditional method is to edit the text to make it semi-legible e.g. by removing the vwls or st*rr*ng th* ess*nt**l p*rts **t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let the critics and nastygrams find their own site, and force their authors out into the open.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One of the reasons that blogs emerged from the Internet primordial soup in the late 1990s was that Usenet had degenerated into spam, fake posts, and abuse; by holding the discussion on a web page you control, you could start to control it.&nbsp; &nbsp;That makes the world a little bit harder to follow when discussions fly around, but in exchange you get to be not just author but (critically) also editor of your own publication.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-09-08-reminder-system/">Reminder systems, a survey and overview</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Part of what I hope will be a series of posts, and with that I hope some publishable output at the end; my guess is that if I write about this a dozen times I'll have 1800 publishable words on the topic when I'm done.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;The quick word check on the search engine shows up 400000+ uses of the term, and a handful of ads, which suggests that's a common phrase; you'll also see &quot;reminder services&quot;, &quot;appointments reminder&quot;, &quot;meetings reminder&quot;, and a zillion others.&nbsp; So this is not new ground, not by any means.</p>

<p>The particular chunk of this space I am interested in is the &quot;note to future self&quot;; the message that you send to yourself in the future to do or think of something, which comes to you as a message in some way.&nbsp; Think of it as a time capsule that you open, or a package that you had forgotten and then reopened; some part of it will hopefully be novel and trigger some &quot;that's easy&quot; reaction rather than the &quot;oh blah I still can't figure out how to do that&quot;.</p>

<p>My future self is a lot more capable than I am, as witnessed by all of the promises that my current self makes for my future self to do.&nbsp; Sometimes these are things which sound easy in the instant but actually prove hard in the future; others are things which my current self has figured out in essence but just hasn't worked through in detail, and thus it needs a little nudge to push it back to that memory of how to solve it.&nbsp; It always helps to have some sleep on problems.</p>

<p>So we remind ourselves.&nbsp; We put notes on the door, post things on the fridge, leave out the shoes on the steps so that they go to the shoemakers, paste sticky notes on our laptops.&nbsp; Elaborate tickler systems send us to the stores to buy forty three color coded folders, which get cut up and used by our children for craft projects.&nbsp; &nbsp;Facebook tells us about our friends birthdays, but not quite in enough time to send them postcards; our dentist and insurance agent seem to be the most regular, if boring correspondents.</p>

<p>I'll collect the various systems I've used, am using, or gave up on in this category; there are some in the previous &quot;Calendars&quot; section which I'll mine for ideas.&nbsp; </p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most interesting things researchers discovered was that
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; paw paw flowers are primarily pollinated by carrion flies and
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; commercial growers now hang plastic &quot;donut shop&quot; buckets
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; with &quot;road kill&quot; to stimulate visits to their
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; patches by the carrion flies.&nbsp; (They hang used buckets
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; because it keeps it away from other critters.)

<div>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason I can surmise the carrion fly link to paw paw pollination
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; is that in more wild areas of the western Appalachians paw
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; paw is a common lowland speicies, especially along
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; streams......and...

<div>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;color: #000000;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Paw paw is one of the first trees to flower in the spring.&nbsp; There
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are few insects generally around at that time of year because
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a frost can take place at almost any time and pollinator numbers
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; are severely limited.&nbsp; Carrion flies feeding on dead animals
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; that often comprise a portion of streamside detritus
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; accumulated during winter and spring freshets would certainly
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; make some sort of sense, especially during the midst of the first
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; few warm days of spring.

      <p>This recipe is much too easy this time of year when tomatoes are in abundance and taste great; don't even think of doing it with winter styrofoam tomatoes.</p>

<p>Sauce:</p>

<p>A little olive oil<br />Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller<br />Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh</p>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a pan.&nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don't bother to skin or peel or seed them.&nbsp; Sprinkle on basil.</p>

<p>Cook, uncovered, over low heat until the tomatoes are cooked down into a sauce (but not so much that it's a paste).</p>

<p>Serve with anelletti - Trader Joe's has it right now - or some other similar small pasta like baby shells.</p>

<p>I fried a few sliced mushrooms and chopped onions in a little olive oil and added them to mine, but the boys preferred just tomato sauce, perhaps with a little grated cheese.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Part of an occasional &quot;blogger's secret&quot; series.</p>

<p>Write for yourself. Really, you are best off with an audience of one
to start, and use your time and effort to write down things that you
will want to read in a week or a month or a year. If you are
interesting to your audience of one, you have some hope of being
interesting to some other person somewhere else on the planet who is
interested in you. Tip: If you have already writtten something
somewhere on the net that you're proud of, repurpose it or reprint it
in your blog; that can get you off to a good start.</p>

<p>As an adjunct to this, you can use scheduled reminder services to nudge you in the right direction and remind you about things you might want to remember in the future.&nbsp; So write that note to your future self, and then publish a pointer to in in the future, so that you'll see it again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging.</p>

<p>If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.</p>

<p>Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG.</p>

<p>If you're doing your homework, you should be able to do homework for your readers. Find a popular search term that's driving traffic to an existing page, identify an alternate database with better resources than what a simple Google search will unearth, and add to your existing copy. I find Google Books to be a good source, especially for pre-1922 materials which give some historical perspective on the matter. Amazon and your favorite library are good book reference sources. Thousands of other databases have awful user interfaces and hidden away content which can be selectively referenced for good effect.</p>

<p>This is neatly summarized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Fuller_(social_epistemologist)">Steve Fuller</a> in his 2001 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Management-Foundations-KMCI-Press/dp/0750673656">Knowledge management foundations</a> </p>

<blockquote><p>Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.</p></blockquote><p>and thus as a blogger you have an opportunity to pull from one unfamiliar expert system into a familiar non-expert system.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging.</p>

<p>The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic.</p>

<p>By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things.</p>

<p>For instance, this afternoon's traffic included this query:</p>

<p>14:04
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=prices of pumpkins" target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=prices%20of%20pumpkins">Google Search:&nbsp; prices of pumpkins</a></p>

<p>which reminds me that Halloween is right around the corner, and that it's time to check out the pumpkin crop and locate a source for this year.</p>

<p>When someone says to you that they won't write about or invest in topics that have limited &quot;shelf life&quot; - the annual outhouse races, the chicken broil, the first tomato, football parking, the opening day of deer season - smile and know that those one time events happen every year and if you ever write something reasonable about it you'll start getting repeat visits next year.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Whenever the power goes out, there's a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on.</p>

<p>Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what's going on - there's a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.&nbsp; With hurricanes on their way, and dozens of different electric companies dealing with possible problems, it looked like a mess.&nbsp; So I made a map.</p>

<iframe width="425" scrolling="no" height="350" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;s=AARTsJp0kTd9LVAlt2TXywCOVrI94rIX_g&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113932165856461159137.000455fd4a9e930f6b943&amp;ll=36.668419,-83.935547&amp;spn=24.587157,37.353516&amp;z=4&amp;output=embed"> </iframe>

<p><small><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113932165856461159137.000455fd4a9e930f6b943&amp;ll=36.668419,-83.935547&amp;spn=24.587157,37.353516&amp;z=4&amp;source=embed" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); text-align: left;">View Larger Map</a></small>

</p>

<p>This map (incomplete now; notably missing the west coast and new england) has regions corresponding to power company service areas, more or less, and links from those regions direct to the outage reporting page.&nbsp; It's a hack - you'd love something lovely which really put all of the live data on one page - but you live with the infrastructure you have, not the infrastructure you want to have.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>As I said a bunch of vendors are working on these sorts of tools; here's a review of sorts.</p>

<p>The shiniest and nicest so far appears to be <a href="http://www.ifactorconsulting.com">iFactor</a>, which handles mapping for Con Edison (NYC), Progress Energy (Fla), Nebraska Public Power District and Entergy (New Orleans). The New Orleans system has had a tremendous workout with Gustav, and at some point the crush of queries made them take it offline; it went back online with limited information (ie. the utility doesn't know when things are going to be online again so that part of the system is disabled).&nbsp; They are using Microsoft Virtual Earth for their base maps.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">Gustav: social media lessons being learned</a>
      </h3>
      <p>While it's still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net's response to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; I'm not putting a lot of links in this post.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter looked like an actual help here for the folks I knew, both to help let others know where they were going (or whether they were staying) and to help make the evacuation process somewhat less isolating.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Evacuation path: Those who left relatively early had relatively easier driving; by the time evacuation was underway in earnest the traffic jams were huge, some gas stations were temporarily out of gas, and the contraflow caused a lot of congestion when it ended.&nbsp; Twitter again seemed to be useful to help people figure out which non-Interstate highways looked like reasonable exit paths, or at least if it wasn't useful at that moment it was something to file away for next time.</p>

<p>Lodging and companionship when you arrive: Here the contrasts associated with poverty and access to resources are the starkest.&nbsp; Those with means to leave early and drive far arrived to empty shelters, and people eager to help; those who went somewhat off the beaten path, and knew where they were going, found their choice of hotel rooms; those who evacuated late and didn't go very far found themselves in crowded shelters right in the hurricane's path.&nbsp; There were stories of Labor Day reunions with family that had left during Katrina for another city and never came back, and more than one account of people who evacuated to their previous Katrina evac destination.</p>

<p>Keeping track of things back home: New Orleans was out of the worst of the storm, and a cadre of well connected people stayed behind, and as a result there's been detailed reporting on status down to which bars are open and who has power (even though the Entergy site is only reporting aggregate numbers at the parish level).&nbsp; Other places had it much worse, with Baton Rouge the biggest loser, getting a substantial storm hit and a lot of NOLA refugees in shelters and really bad power and telephone recovery.&nbsp; I don't (personally) have as connected a Baton Rouge network as I do a New Orleans network, so it feels second hand and isolated.</p>

<p>Decision to return:&nbsp; This is a complicated set of decisions as of yet not completely played out, and really the next question.&nbsp; If I return home, will there be flooding on the way?&nbsp; Will the power be on?&nbsp; Will I have phone service, will the toilets work, will there be good drinking water, will I get stopped on my way home and then stuck?&nbsp; If I don't go home, can I afford the hotel stay?&nbsp; </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>The other question you have to ask, of course, is whether the Internet has been helpful for 2 million people, or just for 200 who are super well connected.</p>

<p>The OnStar service announced how much health and welfare traffic it took during Gustav, and how helpful it was to have trained professional staff on the other end of the phone line to help people during an evacuation - to find hotel rooms, to give driving directions, to be calm.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Various &quot;social media projects&quot; sprung up to coordinate information, but the real winner in the wild appears to be radio (in particular <a href="http://twitter.com/mpronline">Mississippi Public Radio</a>), which can reach people right close by even if their phone is out of battery or out of service.</p>

<p>CNN was broadcasting live (!1!1!) using Twitter to get real time feedback from people - how much of that is just the nature of broadcast news to seize on new technology, and how much is it some fundamental change in how reporting is done in the middle of a disaster.</p>

<p>The test, I'm sure, happens not this week or next but months or years from now as Houma, LA is rebuilt or when Pineville, LA and Alexandria, LA once again have clean running water.&nbsp; There's some disappointment in that the reaction has been &quot;it missed New Orleans, no problems&quot;, when that's so clearly not the case.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-08-26-google-adsense/">Google AdSense in professional association wikis</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Google's AdSense program is designed to provide relevant targeted advertising content to web pages.&nbsp; It works, sometimes intermittently, on weblogs - but there's often enough other non-relevant things on the design of those pages to work only indifferently.&nbsp; What you do find however is that the appropriately targeted wiki design - especially one where the subject matter expertise of a professional association is involved, and where the words in use a specific to a field of specialty - yields extremely targeted results.</p>

<p>Caution is worthwhile, however, because for every well-targeted advertising stripe you get the occasional horrible, unprofessional blunder.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some cases in point.</p>

<p><a href="http://quimica.wikispaces.com/">Quimica from the American Chemical Society</a> is running this ad on page one, hosted on Wikispaces:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/26/picture_8.png" title="Picture_8" alt="Picture_8" />


<br />Now ask yourself, what is to blame here?&nbsp; There are three ways that you can fix a problem like this of having inappropriate advertising running in your wiki.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Don't run advertising at all.&nbsp; Host your wiki yourself, or host it somewhere with an option to turn off advertising.&nbsp; Remove the risk of the accidental inappropriate Adwords ad by not using Adwords as an ad network.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Sell advertising in-house as sponsorships, or run house ads in the stripe of the page normally designed for external advertising.&nbsp; This might very reasonably be ads for things like upcoming association events, membership benefits, or other details that look like advertising targeted straight at your members.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; Use the Google AdSense ad quality as a measure of the relevance of the pages you have, and edit the wiki until the junk ads don't show up.&nbsp; Block advertisers that are inappropriate, remove page text that triggers inappropriate ads, and otherwise optimize for relevance, professionalism, and revenue.&nbsp; This works best when you are hosting a wiki on a platform and get the revenues for the advertising - some &quot;free&quot; wiki hosting really is paid for by click-throughs on ads that you are running, and if your association members are using Google Adwords to promote themselves they may well be running ads that would be very relevant on your site.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Use Google AdSense quality as a quality check on the professionalism of the AdWords advertising that your association members are running.&nbsp; From time to time, advertising copy writers at agencies will write ads that are completely inappropriate because of regulation or professional standards that they are blissfully unaware of, and by having a spot which attracts these ads you can build in feedback for professional ethics.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-08-21-how-do-you-keep/">How do you keep your calendar?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week's a2b3 meeting.&nbsp; Here are some things people shared.</p>

<p>Many people were using <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school.</p>

<p>Several of the people who used calendars to publish events for the general public talked about using an embedded Google Calendar in their blog as a quick and efficient way to share information and keep it up to date, like this one:</p>

<iframe width="400" scrolling="no" height="400" frameborder="0" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?title=a2b3%20&amp;showNav=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=400&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=8d9lpkmgltprmtbkv8p0tr39co%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York" style="border-width: 0pt;"> </iframe>

<p>A possible downside to the plethora of Google calendars is that there are literally half a dozen different otherwise indistinguishable versions of e.g. the Michigan Football schedule online, none of which can be trusted to reliably get game times right (or at least I haven't found any way to predict which one will work the best).</p>

<p>Of the non-Google online calendars, <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Calendar</a> got a vote as a family calendar, and someone was looking at <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra.</a> </p>

<p>On the work side of things, most people who were dealing with calendar systems mentioned Outlook at least once, not always with warmth and fuzziness.&nbsp; One person had Lotus Notes running, an excellent corporate calendar but one that refuses to sync or share.</p>

<p>Those people doing project management had a bias towards Microsoft Excel as a way to keep track of shared expectations about details, and one Microsoft Project user was in the room.</p>

<p>A relatively large number of people had positive things to say about synchronization of calendars to their mobile phone, more than I would have expected.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hsgconsultingllc.com/?p=86">Helene Gidley did a nice roundup of mobile device calendar syncing</a> which hits some of the high points; there's more than one way to do it, and some of them cost money.</p>

<p>Someone noted that they use <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a> to sync everything, and that everything more or less just works, and that this was remarkable enough that everything worked to make it a surprise.</p>

<p>Several people were using paper calendars as their primary daily calendar, either as a standalone calendar, a day planner style book, or a Moleskine as a GTD style capture device that got turned into calendar entries once a day.</p>

<p>I was one of two people who used a personal wiki as a diary style calendar (I use Socialtext, the other person uses Mediawiki, both set up in private one-person-wiki mode).</p>

<p>The universal shared paper calendar was the fridge calendar - if anyone wants to build a high tech fridge, just do the calendar application for it.&nbsp; This was the place where the family negotiated events and scheduling and changes and handoffs and other important timing efforts.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>A friend of mine advised living a life simple enough that you could keep track of all of it on a single piece of paper; not quite there yet.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-08-21-coping-with-com/">Coping with community growth</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/a2b3">The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents</a> had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need.</p>

<p>The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you cope with community growth?&nbsp; In particular, if you have an organization that has regular meetings and it outstrips the capabilities of its venue, what do you do to keep it going?&nbsp; Some ideas.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Hold the meeting more frequently.&nbsp; If the monthly meeting is full every time, do a second event on alternate weeks.&nbsp; This is what movie theaters do with popular films (matinees, midnight films, 10a showings) or what busy religious congregations do.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Move the meeting from place to place.&nbsp; Some people will come if it's convenient enough, so if you move from place to place you'll get a variety of people attending who wouldn't otherwise because it's incrementally less convenient.&nbsp; <a href="http://motorcityconnect.collectivex.com/main/summary">Motor City Connect has ten meetings in eight cities around the Detroit area every month,</a> with the idea that it's going to be somewhere close to you some time.</p>

<p>3. Let the group subdivide laterally, with some part of the original collection of people doing something related at a different place and a different time.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microcoworking.com">The a2b3 group spawned (in some sense) the microcoworking group</a>, which started with one day and has expanded to three days at three different locations.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Raise the bar for participation, so that your community grows more slowly.&nbsp; At an extreme, you get new member initiation rituals that approach hazing, and so anyone who wants to stick around really wants to stick around; at the extreme, this coupled with no new member recruitment gives you groups that stop growing and start to grow old with the same people there every time.</p>

<p>5. Grow into different forms, e.g. take an offline group and put it online, or take an online group on one community platform and add it to another community platform.&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 has a very strong and functional mailing list,</a> so people don't have to be at the meetings to post a job offering or get bike repair recommendations or locate a trusted network security auditor (to give but three examples).</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; Use one group to bootstrap the creation of a new group, and then pull your energy out of the first group.&nbsp; In a religious setting this would be a <a href="http://www.joyfulheart.com/plant/splinter.htm">splinter church</a>, and just by that very name you get some sense at some possible social friction that would result.&nbsp; </p>

<p>7.&nbsp; Move your focus from local groups to national or global ones, and grow a community of practice globally rather than just locally.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?wiki_wednesdays">Wiki Wednesday meets on the first Wednesday of the month worldwide</a>; the <a href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/">Web Analytics Wednesday group</a> coordinates Wednesday meetings worldwide.&nbsp; The local meeting is probably still local, but it's part of a bigger world.</p>

<p>Some of these growth strategies yield more managable growth; others recognize that groups might just reach a happy steady state where you don't really want to multiply your size.&nbsp; </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you'd be surprised how many people apply who haven't any connection at all).</p>
<p>
The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there's no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile.&nbsp; That makes the workflow very clumsy and slow.
</p>
<p>
The fix-it-yourself approach to this is Greasemonkey, splicing in the existing code that does this feature on other parts of the site to the Admin UI page.&nbsp; for your (really, for my) reading enjoyment, here's that code. </p>

<p>Part two is causing this code to be called on another page other than the one it currently is being called!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>* js/miniprofile_popup.js */<br /><br />var miniProfile=function()<br />{var profileLinks,popContainer;<br />var responseSuccess=function(o){popContainer.getElementsByTagName('div')[0].innerHTML=o.responseText;<br />popContainer.setAttribute('hasMiniPanel','true');<br />lui.miniPanel.setBody(o.responseText);<br />addPanelEvents();<br />lui.miniPanel.move(popContainer);<br />lui.miniPanel.show();}<br /><br />var callBack={success:responseSuccess,argument:[popContainer],timeout:10000}<br /><br />var addPanelEvents=function()<br />{lui.miniPanel.addCloseEvent();<br />var actionForms=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('action-form','div',profilePanelBody);<br />if(actionForms==&quot;&quot;)return;<br />for(var i=0;actionForms.length&gt;i;i++){actionForms[i].style.display=&quot;none&quot;;}<br />var flagLink=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('action-flag','a',profilePanelBody);<br />YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(flagLink,'click',function(e){YAHOO.util.Event.preventDefault(e);<br />toggleFlagForm(actionForms);},profilePanelBody);}<br /><br />var toggleFlagForm=function(el)<br />{for(var i=0;el.length&gt;i;i++)<br />{if(el[i].style.display==&quot;block&quot;)<br />{lui.hide(el[i]);}else{lui.show(el[i]);}}}<br />return{init:function(){profileLinks=YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('miniprofile-container','span','body');<br />lui.miniPanel.init(profileLinks,miniProfile.showProfile,miniProfile.fetchProfile);<br />profilePanelBody=lui.miniPanel.get();},fetchProfile:function(el){popContainer=el;<br />var url=el.className.split(' ')[1];<br />YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest('GET',url,callBack);},<br />showProfile:function(el){popContainer=el;lui.miniPanel.setBody(el.getElementsByTagName('div')[0].innerHTML);<br />addPanelEvents();<br />lui.miniPanel.move(el);<br />lui.miniPanel.show();}}}();<br /><br />miniProfile.init();</pre>

      <p>These are projected, estimated, possible, or likely prices for Michigan football parking for 2008.&nbsp; It's based on <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pqZp74nNK6ZunQusNTgfKfA&amp;hl=en">the dataset I collected from the 2007 football season</a>, which as you might recall had an unfortunate start (which definitely impacted prices).</p>

</p>

<p>It needs better icons so you don't have to decode the color chart.&nbsp; Typically prices can vary $5 from week to week depending on the game, and if all goes well it will rain on a Thursday so that the golf course is closed and thus neighborhood parking is at a premium.

      </h3>
      <p>The Ann Arbor Link Bus starts service again next week.&nbsp; Every year I get tired of not being able to figure out when the bus is going to show up, and this year I tried to build a new map to help out.&nbsp; This is a work in progress.</p>

<p>The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I'll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.&nbsp; So the Y stop becomes an 11 stop, since the bus is supposed to get there at 11 26 41 56.</p>

<p>Google Maps now has a way to do custom icons, and I'm using letters from a Unicode alphabet to get the circled numbers.&nbsp; A few glitches still until I host those icons locally.&nbsp; It's hard to get the icons located precisely right at all scales and resolutions, don't know how to fix that (short of actually doing paste up on a paper map).</p>

UPDATE: <a href="http://www.homelessdave.com">Dave Askins</a> is contributing a set of icons for the stop markers - the "9" stop there is the new and improved, which allows for better stop locating.

      <p>We're back from a summer vacation on Cape Cod, and now it's time for back to school.&nbsp; Ann Arbor makes a very rapid transition from summer town to college town in the span of about 72 hours, and it's just about time for everything to change.</p>

<p>You know it's time for school to start when the next projects on your fun list are the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/link-bus-2008-m.html">new Link Bus schedule</a>, the football parking prices map, the 3d grade start of school picnic and the daycare potluck.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I'm still writing the Superpatron weblog, and working on an article on mobile versions of library catalogs, so that when you're on the go you can look up a book or when you're in the library you can remember what you were there for.</p>

<p>Really new for me this year is a fresh interest in law school - Deb starts at Wayne State Law today, and so there will be a lot more law related stuff to be aware of.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a sneaking suspicion that means a new blog, just to pull that stuff all to one place, since I'll bet there will be two posts a day to write about that experience if I choose to.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I've told you once, I've told you 146 times: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22repetition+is+the+very+soul+of+the+net%22">repetition is the very soul of the net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a> is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.&nbsp; His 1992 masters thesis, <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm">Optimization of Learning</a>, covered the early work on Supermemo and a discussion of spaced repetition in learning.</p>

<p>I've been using some of the principles from SuperMemo, in particular the discussion of<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/paper.htm"> using SuperMemo without a computer</a>, to structure some organized retrospective looks at what I have been interested in over time and also to trigger follow up contacts with people and ideas that would have otherwise been forgotten.&nbsp; The important element of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> is used not to remember facts and figures but to trigger memory of people and the context I saw them in.&nbsp; The idea is that you structure a process to revisit previous days efforts - more recent days more frequently, and old days less frequently - and use that memory jogger to keep you connected.</p>

<p>What makes this newly easy (or at least easier) is some combination of tools and search engines not originally available in 1987, combined with my existing frequent blogging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me provide two examples, with some source code.</p>

<p>I keep a personal wiki with a page for each day.&nbsp; This is actually the second of those I have tried doing - the first was on custom pre-release versions of the Socialtext software and I reanimated it on the current Socialtext hosted platform.&nbsp; The notion is that you have a wiki page named &quot;2008 August 12&quot;, or really one page possible for every day, and you take notes on or about that day there or link to it to refer to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;There's a little bit of code that I wrote to make links from that page to a series of days spaced in the past and future which I include as a block on that page, making it easy to hyperlink forwards and backwards in time.&nbsp; That's good, as far as I do have things in my personal wiki (though maintaining that every day is a burden and I often have big blank spots when the burden of diligence is too great).</p>

<p>The second and more immediately practical approach uses search engines to replace explicit page dates to slice up the world into punctuated time slices.&nbsp; &nbsp; I use this with my weblog, creating searches like<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Avielmetti.typepad.com+%22August+12%2C+2007%22">site:vielmetti.typepad.com &quot;August 12, 2007&quot;</a><br />to methodically revisit the past.&nbsp; As I said, it helps if you post daily, or have a tool like the delicious.com tag poster to do it for you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The code I wrote which I'll share is based on &quot;day.sh&quot; which I released some time ago.&nbsp; That tool prints the date a specified time in the past; this new tool, &quot;<a href="http://monkey.org/~emv/src/spaced-days.tar">spaced-days</a>&quot;, creates a series of days formatted appropriately for whatever you want to paste them into.&nbsp; The sample I have generates Socialtext formatted wiki pages but minor edits will generate Mediawiki pages and more major ones could make HTML with the formatted searches above.</p>

<p>So if I'm thinking about my cousin's wedding two years ago, or next year's St Urho's Day celebrations, or the Burns Park Run for 2009, it's because there was just enough reminders to jog 1/n of my memory and not the whole darn thing.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>UPDATE: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/11/michigan-2008-election-results.html">Michigan election results for the November 2008 general election</a>, if you came here from a search.</p>

<p>The polls have closed, and results are just starting to trickle in at 8:30pm.   Here's some places to look for data.  (update: it's the next day and the votes are tallied)</p>

<p>The Michigan Secretary of State has <a href="http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/08PRI/">2008 Unofficial Michigan Primary Election Results</a> for all state-wide races, state senators and representatives, and judicial races. They also have links to <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1633_8722-103241--,00.html">Michigan primary election results by county</a> connected to almost all of the county clerk sites maintained around the state.</p>

<p>In Washtenaw County, there's a page with <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/indexreport.html">unofficial Washtenaw County election results for August 2008</a>, including <A href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/cumulativereport.html">cumulative results</a> and a breakdown by race.  Notable contested races are the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport382.html">Democratic primary Washtenaw Sheriff</a> election, and the <a href="http://electionresults.ewashtenaw.org/aug2008/canvassreport544.html">15th District Judge</a> race.   The <a href="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/08/roundup_of_results_in_washtena.html">Ann Arbor News has a roundup of results.</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oakgov.com/crts0006/controller">Oakland County non-partisan and proposal ballot results</a> include a proposal for a tax to support the zoo, which passed.   The <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080806/NEWS15/80806019">Detroit Free Press has complete 2008 August election results</a>.</p>

<p>All of the <a href="http://www.co.marquette.mi.us/clerk/results-1.htm">2008 Marquette County August primary</a> results are on one page.  (Two friends from high school are both running for judge.)  I expect to see <A href="http://www.miningjournal.net/">voting results at the Marquette Mining Journal</a>, but nothing there as of 9am Weds.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/DavidHelwig">David Helwig</a> (twitter) is covering the <a href="http://sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=33725">Chippewa County</a> elections for <a href="http://sootoday.com">SooToday</a>.</p>

<p>More details as anything is notable.  </p>

<p>Several newspapers have coverage with Twitter - the <a href="http://twitter.com/a2snooze">Ann Arbor News</a> has an (ahem) unofficial feed, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mlive">mLive</a> does some state-wide coverage.  Other newspaper twitters are dead including the Flint Journal and the Detroit Free Press.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cookingdebauchery.com/cooking_debauchery/2006/09/blueberrybuffal.html">Blueberry buffalo stew</a> from Cooking Debauchery, via merathena on LJ:<br />
<blockquote><br />
The blueberries melt into the stock producing the most delectable, mahogany colored broth and a fragrance the fills the house with the scents of fall. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>We're vegetarians at home, so this is going to have to be someone else's potluck dish.  There's buffalo raised in Michigan at <a href="http://www.sprikfarms.com/">Sprik Farms</a> near Grand Rapids, and at <a href="http://www.tmzfarm.com/">TMZ Farm</a> near Pinckney.</p>

<p><b>Blueberry-Buffalo Stew</b></p>

<p>1 ½ - 2 pounds buffalo, beef, or lamb stew meat<br />
1 cup blueberries<br />
4 cups chicken or beef stock<br />
2 tablespoons canola oil (or bacon drippings)<br />
1 ½ tablespoons honey<br />
3 tablespoons dry sherry (optional)<br />
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)<br />
Salt and pepper to taste</p>

<p>Cut the meat into one inch chunks and season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Heat a large Dutch oven or stew pot.  Drizzle in oil or bacon dripping to coat the bottom.  Working in batches, brown the meat well on all sides.  Add oil as necessary.  Do not over crowd the pan.  Remove browned meat to a clean dish and cover.</p>

<p>Once all the meat is browned, return it all to the pan with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.  Add stock and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and skim off any froth that has collected on the surface until the broth is clear.  Add the blueberries, honey, sherry, and cayenne pepper and bring back to a boil.</p>

<p>Simmer for 2 hours or until the meat is very tender and the broth has reduced.  Stir occasionally.  This helps to break up the blueberries and incorporate them into the liquid.  By the end of the cooking time the blueberries should be completely incorporated.</p>

<p>Serve with crusty bread and salad.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The primaries in Michigan are tomorrow, August 5 2008.</p>

<p>If you want a sample ballot, go to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/vote">Michigan Voter Information Center</a> run by the Michigan Secretary of State.  You'll put in your voter information, and it will come up with a list of elections on the ballot.  <a href="http://publius.org">Publius also generates Michigan sample ballots</a>, as does the <a href="http://thevoterguide3.mlive.com/?sfr">MLive Voter Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/elections/el_precincts.html">Washtenaw County precinct locations</a> is kept by the County Clerk and Register of Deeds, Larry Kestenbaum.  He's running unopposed for re-election.  </p>

<p>I'll be voting again this year using the AUTOMARK machine set up for vision impaired voters.  My notes from last time <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">show the problems I had with the AUTOMARK machine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Note for next time: vote early (and vote often), and tear the stub off before inserting the ballot into the AutoMARK machine, despite all of the instructions to the contrary.
</blockquote>

<p>My experience with AutoMARK is not unique - here's this season's clippings of people with problems:</p>

<p>Nassau County, NY: from the <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/NYSTEC-Finds-NY-SBOE-Votin-by-Rady-Ananda-080711-393.html">OpEd News</a> site (some political blog)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Nassau County purchased 450 ballot marking devices (BMDs) from Sequoia, at a cost of $12,000 each.  It reported that 85% of 240 machines were non-functional, one fifth of them damaged during shipment.  New York City also experienced software failure, when it tested ES&S AutoMARK's BMD, as attested at the June 23rd NYC Government Services Committee, reported Nassau County Attorney Lori Barrett.   </p>

<p>Ballot marking devices allow disabled voters to vote independently, printing the ballot for them, and would fulfill NY's compliance with the Help America Vote Act.  Yet a substantial portion of BMDs received in Nassau registered a printer failure.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>San Francisco is sold uncertified AutoMARK systems: from <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/elections_index.asp?id=70865">the San Francisco Department of Elections</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
On August 21, 2007, the Secretary of State announced a public hearing to examine ES&S's sale of uncertified AutoMARK machines to five California counties, including San Francisco.  In April 2006, San Francisco purchased 565 AutoMARKs from ES&S for $6,185.89 per machine, paying a total purchase price of nearly $3.5 million.  Unbeknownst to San Francisco at the time of the purchase, and as later reported by the Secretary of State, these 565 machines (as well as 407 AutoMARKs sold to other California counties) were uncertified.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after receiving the Secretary of State's statement, the Director of Elections confirmed that the voting machines ES&S sold San Francisco in April 2006 for use in the June 2006 and subsequent elections were the uncertified AutoMARK Model A200 machines.  But at the time of the sale, ES&S represented to San Francisco that it was providing AutoMARK Model A100 machines, which had been previously certified by the Secretary of State in August 2005, roughly seven months prior to San Francisco's purchase.  In fact, the machines ES&S provided were AutoMARK Model A200 machines, which had not been certified by the Secretary of State.  Unaware that ES&S's representations that the machines were certified were false, San Francisco unwittingly used what turned out to have been uncertified AutoMARK ballot marking machines in both the June 2006 and November 2006 elections. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Ed Felten's Freedom to Tinker blog on <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1269">California review of the ES&S AutoMARK and M100</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Yet still, they note that “We are not aware of any public device that has more flexibility in accommodating the wide range of physical and dexterity abilities that voters may have. The key, as always, is whether pollworkers and voters will be able to identify and implement the optimal input system without better guidance or expert support. In fact, it may be that the more flexible a system is, the more difficult it is for novices to navigate through the necessary choices for configuring the access options in order to arrive at the best solution.” One of their most striking findings was how long it took test subjects to use the system. Audio-only voters needed an average of almost 18 minutes to use the machine on a simplified ballot (minimum 10 minutes; maximum 35 minutes). Write-in votes were exceptionally difficult. And, again, this is arguably one of the best voting systems available, at least from an accessibility perspective.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Vote early (you might need the extra time!)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota.  From a <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/article.do?rid=189603">profile of Jim Johnson</a> by writer <a href="http://www.mnartists.org/artistHome.do?rid=11865">Cheryl Reitan</a> in the <a href="http://www.mnartists.org">mnartists.org</a> site:</p>

<blockquote>
JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.
</blockquote>

<p><b>In The Blueberry Bucket (from A Field Guide to Blueberries)</b><br />
<blockquote><br />
A man picks blueberries all day. In the bucket<br />
small green and withered sifting down,<br />
too old and squashed against the sides,<br />
twigs leave spruce needles settled to the bottom<br />
while the large ripe rise up to the top.<br />
So full of flesh, so ordinary?<br />
a woman, at sunset<br />
a blond woman leading a reindeer<br />
across the horizon. You are that woman. I am that man.<br />
And this I give to you<br />
is, if not the history of the world<br />
at the end of the day, but<br />
a bucketful of blueberries.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In blueberry picking news, we were at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm">the Dexter Blueberry Farm</a> yesterday (August 2 2008) and picked a good quantity of berries - the big commercial high bush berries which are easier to fill buckets with, even if you are the only one picking and your traveling companions are mostly eating.</p>

<blockquote>
Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. "It has the string sound of a viola," Kallet says, "and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it's small enough that I can handle it easily."

<p>Many of the pieces on the record possess elements of Scandinavian melody and harmony, yet remain Balkan in rhythm.</p>

<p>"Cindy and I love to play Swedish and Norwegian traditional fiddle tunes in which the fiddlers play in harmony with each other," Larsen says. "It's a beautiful sound, and you can get four-part harmonies going with just two people."<br />

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-08-01-laptop-backpack/">Laptop backpacks - summary of recommendations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I recently sent out an email query to the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3</a> mailing list about backpacks suitable for laptops.&nbsp; In the interests of not keeping useful information in my inbox, here's a summary of sorts.</p>

<p>The list, in no particular order, with some amount of incomplete information:</p>

<p>Land's End: the pack I have has a label, don't know the name of it in their catalog.&nbsp; It's nice.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.landsend.com/outfits/backpacks/index.html">Land's End backpack page</a> has more.</p>

<p>North Face: the Yavapai, &quot;carries not only my laptop but a change of clothes when I get to work by bike.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Industries: &quot;really like it. However, when I graduated from a MacBook to a Pro, the notebook was a bit too large, so definitely try inserting the notebook before purchasing.&quot;</p>

<p>Patagonia: Lightwire backpack &quot;a great deal&quot; right now at least <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/product/product_focus.jsp?OPTION=PRODUCT_FOCUS_DISPLAY_HANDLER&amp;style_color=48860-683&amp;ws=true&amp;catcode=WS.WEB_SPECIALS&amp;refferer=WSL">on sale now</a></p>

<p>Tom Bihn: &quot;As someone who has carried my laptop in it everywhere for the last 10 years, I highly recommend&quot; the <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/100/TB0104">Brain Bag</a>.</p>

<p>Spire USA: &quot;I've been carrying a messenger vert bag from <a href="http://spireusa.com">Spire USA</a> for 9 years.&nbsp; Others in my family use the backpacks and love them as much as I love my bag.&nbsp; Their bags have had good attention to detail for people connected to their laptops.&quot;</p>

<p>Office Depot / Staples: &quot;For the budget minded I found the laptop backpacks at Office Depot/Staples to be very sufficient&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbpbags.com/hamptons_collection.html">BBP:</a> &quot;It's innovative, big, and while it's always in backpack mode - it still kinda looks like a messenger bag - which to my way of thinking makes it a 1/2 step more acceptable in the rare more formal meeting.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timbuk2.com">Timbuk 2</a>: &quot;I am using a Timbuk2 Messenger Bag that I got from Bivouac a few years ago.&nbsp; Great bag, and I think it will outlive ME!&quot;</p>

<p>Timbuk2 again: I have the Timbuk2 Underground. It's incredible spacious - I carry my MBP, DSLR + 2 lenses, several books in the main compartment. And then there are the 2 side pockets that carry numerous other gadgets, GPS, power cord, etc.</p>

<p>Franklin Covey: <a href="http://shopping.franklincovey.com/shopping/catalog/productaccessories.jsp?navAction=push&amp;navCount=0&amp;crc=cat129&amp;id=prod1710026&amp;skuid=32361">Victorinox</a>: &quot;This spring I finally found a backpack I am happy with.&nbsp; It is the world's greatest compter backpack.&nbsp; It can easily allow you to travel with two computers and accessories, or with just one computer and all your travel needs for a night or two.&nbsp; It shows no signs of wear after four months, but whenever it does fall apart, it will be the first time I ever happily buy the same model twice in a row.&nbsp; Oh, and did I mention that it costs less than $80?&quot;</p>

<p>Deuter: &quot;I have a Deuter that I bought at Bivouac several years ago. I bought the one that was called something like &quot;mega office&quot; or &quot;giga office&quot;. It's less daypack-y and more laptop-and-pens-n-stuff-hold-y than most of what Bivouac sells. It's been great - nice features, has aged well.&quot;</p>

<p>LL Bean: &quot;I love my LL Bean backpack. My mom got it for me when I was a senior in college (1993-94). It<br />
lived through that year, law school, marriage, our honeymoon (it was my carry-on), teacher certification classes, two teaching jobs, and it is still happy to ride on my back when I ride my bike. I love that bag&quot;</p>

<p>Brenthaven: &quot;I couldn't be a bigger fan of Brenthaven backpacks. I've had one of
their models for probably 8 years and it still looks brand new and is
amazingly well laid out. They are a bit spendy but I see no signs that
this thing will ever wear out.&quot;</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">management metrics: &#34;queue depth days&#34;</a>
      </h3>
      <p>In the manage by numbers world...</p>

<p>One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress.  At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.</p>

<p>If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time.   End the day with 100 unanswered messages 100 days in a row, and your queue-depth-day is 10000 (eek).</p>

<p>There are of course three ways to attack this problem (at least, but bear with me)</p>

<p>1.  Reduce the size of the current queue, so that there's less to deal with right now;<br />
2.  Reduce the influx into the queue, so that there's less to deal with every day;<br />
3.  Increase the speed at which things are removed from the queue, so they don't stay so long.</p>

<p>The inbox zero mantra pulls from all of these, but you really need to understand the impact of all three to attack this.  One time heroic measures to empty the inbox are necessary, because you can't create a bunch of lasting improvement if there's a big overhang of undone work nagging at you.  Slowing down flows inbound helps reduce the rate of queue depth growth, but doesn't clear the queue.  And working faster to acknowledge email just creates more email!</p>

<p>Classic solutions to this whole system is to move communications out of queued systems into either real time systems (IM, chat, voice) or into asynchronous multiplayer games (blogs, wikis).  The hard core communications people completely shut down their email system and go entirely to the other extremes; the other hard core communications people treat their email inbox AS IF IT WERE IM and always answer and file everything instantly.</p>

<p>The queue depth could be anything, really; it could be outstanding phone calls to make, emails to answer, people standing in line in your retail operation, customers waiting impatiently for a call back to solve their time critical problem, or forms needing to be filled out.  Just know that in any system where you can get stuff coming in faster than you can get rid of it queues will form, and at worst they back up to the point where other people can see that you're not on top of everything.</p>

<blockquote><br />
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).<br />

<blockquote><br />
We've all been there, that sickening feeling as you reach for your back pocket, only to find your wallet gone. A frantic search turns up nothing. You feel sad. But you wouldn't feel that sad if you had photocopied the contents of your wallet. Then you would have a legal copy of your license to use until it got replaced, and all your account numbers and the phone numbers you need to call for replacements. So take a second this weekend to pop your wallet into the photocopy or scanner and keep the paper in a safe place. You might be very glad some day that you did.<br />

<p><a href="http://blog.iliumsoft.com/?p=75">Photocopy your wallet - no?</a> (Ellen Craw, Ilium Software)<br />
<blockquote><br />
I really hate it when people suggest photocopying your wallet contents for extra safety. Call me crazy (many people do) and paranoid (there’s some truth to that as well), but a photocopier is nothing but a scanner plus a printer. There’s no guarantee that your info is cleared out as soon as the pages are printed. If it’s your own copier in your own home office, fine, but if you take your wallet to Kinkos or CopyMax or any commercial place, keep in mind that what you’re doing is using their scanner to scan all the numbers you’re carefully protecting other places.<br />

<blockquote><br />
1) Make a backup. Years ago, someone suggested that I put a scan of my critical documents up on the Internet where I could always access them from anywhere. So I scanned my passport, driver's license, and birth certificate in a password-protected file that I mailed to a supplemental Yahoo account. It was easy to just download and print it to have all of the information and documentation that the embassy required.<br />
