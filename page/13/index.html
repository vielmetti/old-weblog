<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I won't be complaining about a small keyboard or a small screen for a while, but I have a lot of tools to reinstall on a new system.</p>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<p>Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there's a working full-screen mode.</p>

<p>git comes with the machine, so I didn't have to install it; it's a big part of making sure that stuff gets version tracked.</p>

<p>Node-RED. I need to have a simple programming environment that is network and device aware, and for the past few months Node-RED has been it. I'm at version 0.9.0 now. That depends first on having node.js installed, and subsequently on pulling in a lot of Node-RED dependencies.</p>

<p>Contacts. I've synced Google Contacts with the Apple address book; that took an extra step since I'm using 2-factor authentication at Google. The CardDAV support is new to me.</p>

<p>Dropbox. Plug it in, it just works. Next.</p>

<p>Google Drive. Plug it in, it seems to work; lots to sync including a lot of photos and a lot of unsorted old crap.</p>

<p>One of the things I'm realizing is that yes, there's lots of "unsorted old crap" on this which is still a new machine. </p>

<p>XCode, that's a mighty big download.</p>

<p>Apple Software Update is patching the shellshock vulnerability, I hope.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Github is not much fun on a very small screen.</p>

<p>Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn't so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone.</p>

<p>None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki.</p>

<p>Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process. Short of getting a bigger screen, I don't see any way to support that kind of flow on a small device.</p>

<p>I simply do not see enough on this little device screen to make it useful for assisting decision making about what to do next. While an omnipresent device is ideal for instant response to the top of the inbox, it is really limiting for handling overflow situations.</p>

<p>If I had to stick to the small screen indefinitely I would cancel some projects that are just too frustrating to keep up with. Surprisingly, blogging would stay. Pushing out commentary in an unlinked one way scroll only demands a modest typing skill and has only a minimum need for structure. </p>

      <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived.</p>

<p>Libraries have traditionally clipped obits in the service of local historians and genealogists to help the info seeker. From time to time I have posted or reprinted obits here, and Arborwiki collects them as well, unevenly but diligently.</p>

<p>What would you have if your collection had every obituary printed for a city, carefully indexed and cross referenced? The big challenge I can imagine is disambiguation, making sure that you can tell the many people apart who share a name and a home town. </p>

      <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.</p>

<p>For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. So even though I am not keeping up with private discourse, my public engagement with the tiny part of the net that reads blogs is going just fine.</p>

<p>The strong temptation is to head to the Apple store and buy something fast, fancy, shiny, waterproof, coffee proof, and with a solid keyboard. I don't know if that device exists. Until then the cup of coffee always goes to the far right of the small screen so I know where it is at all times and so I don't knock it over again.</p>

      <p>Pete Kaminski pointed me to <a href="http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">this essay on archetypes in computer gaming</a>, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.</p>

<p>What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. It is not enough to win friends by your personal charm in this world; instead you write the Bayesian classifier that guides your behavior scientifically towards friend maximization. Whatever can be automated will be automated, and the rest of human behavior analyzed to give clues for further automation.</p>

<p>Lots of online games lend themselves to machines assisting or even taking over. People who have substantial bot writing skills have an undue influence on the culture of online networks and games for the few humans who stick around unarmed to watch the fray up close. What better way to while away the hours online than by tending to your collection of bots that prompt, provoke, or guide the behavior of other humans (or other bots).</p>

      <p>The tone of Michigan football blogs has changed since the loss to Minnesota on Saturday. Before the game there was a lot of grumbling, but it was varied; no one single issue stood out. After the game, it was much more clear.</p>

<p>A series of plays saw the second string Michigan quarterback, Shane Morris, get hit hard on his head. Morris is seen exhibiting signs of a concussion. Yet in an unfortunate sequence he goes back into the game after sitting out one play on the sidelines.</p>

<p>Fans now have a pinpoint spot to point their anger at coach Brady Hoke. The team lost, but it's not all about winning and losing. What matters now is the understanding of the coaching staff and their inability to protect an obviously injured student from further harm.</p>

<p>Michigan has gotten funding to reduce the risk of concussions in sports. It appears that all that effort was for naught in this particular instance of not protecting a player whose judgment was impaired because of a head injury. Coach Hoke is under fire and for good reason.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The revolution will not be blogged. It will be twittered or facebooked or elloed or plurked, but blogging is not a revolutionary activity in the new era of the net.</p>

<p>The process of writing for your own web site and then announcing that you have something new to say to the world is perhaps the least efficient way of getting news to the world. It is so much easier and more efficient to drop that news inside a walled garden of publishing and have it ricochet quickly inside the walls.</p>

<p>If blogging is old school, and slow and cumbersome, then why bother? I can only point to the benefits of having at least the illusion of control over your own words. The instant message instantly delivered inside the AOL chat room or Facebook page or you name your walled garden of choice gets to where it's going fast, but once it's off the screen it's gone. Blogging at least gives you the hope that if you wanted to see something from 10 years ago that it would still be there. </p>

<p>Enduring is a virtue that lends itself to systems that sometimes are more cumbersome for their long use. I am reasonably sure that I will be able to locate this post in 5 or 15 years, even if the nature of publishing on blogs means only a few people will read it the same day it was written.</p>

      <p>At some point in the life of a project it is inevitable that an obstacle comes up that makes you wonder whether your enthusiasm for the effort is well placed.</p>

<p>Do you redouble your efforts, or do you take a break, or do you simply refocus and find something else to zero in on for the moment?</p>

<p>Sometimes a bit of distance can help, at least temporarily. Rather than exit in flames with a tattered manifesto flapping on the door in your wake, just go quiet for a while. If no one notices that you are no longer present so much, then you can free up that unrequited love and apply it to something else for a while.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify
the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing
like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items
that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the
time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once,
and it stuck.</p>

<p>A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do
in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on. I
use github issues to track my big pile of things to do, and alas
it does not have a random() function. Fortunately though there is
a Github API, and that combined with <code>jq</code> and my <code>randomline</code> script
are enough to approximate that.</p>

<p>A third very reasonable approach is to ask someone what they would
like you to do; or even better yet anticipate what they would ask
and do it before they ask.</p>

<p>That reminds me, I have work to do.</p>

      <p>Some notes from the table at the People's Food Co-op.</p>

<p>My Saturday routine is to go to the farmer's market and to the food co-op. I have been doing this for a long time, more than a decade at least. When the boys were smaller they always came along, but now I head out solo.</p>

<p>There is a small cadre of folks who I know from town and from Twitter who also have the same habit, and we compare notes on line as to what is at market. If you track the @a2market account you will see notes on fruits in season, what is missing from market (no peaches this year, alas), and anything else notable.</p>

<p>From time to time a new bit of social network software appears, and the usual crowd of early adopters descends in a nova mob to try it out. This week's novelty is "ello", which is basically a variant on Twitter. There are a small number of structural changes - replies are threaded - and a large number of missing features. Mostly it's new and another chance to reinvent yourself and claim a network identity.</p>

<p>The Saturday morning market Twitter routine does not have much to fear from "ello". It takes a long time to accumulate enough people who share geography, a common interest, and a particular technological proficiency. "ello" does not have that, and it really isn't ever likely to.</p>

<p>My Saturday routine includes a lot of people who I don't know from online. Making the rounds at market and saying hi and making small talk does not depend on getting people to sign up for your net or upgrade their phone. In cases where the online ritual is also tied to space and time, you use whatever system worked last time, not something new!</p>

      <p>What is Wikipedia for? It's for bots.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism">This machine kills trolls: How Wikipedia’s robots and cyborgs snuff out vandalism</a> writes up the work of the Wikipedia contributors who have written robots (bots) that automatically extirpate contributions to the encyclopedia that are unwanted.</p>

<p>Alas, the result of all of this highly efficient robot-driven editing is that many new editors first interaction with the system is not with a human being, but with a faceless robot. The real worry is that the crowd of new editors that used to flock to the site to provide modest and well-intentioned edits are being systematically pushed away by the overroboticism of the systems administration. </p>

<p>Bot vs bot is a long term war that has no human winners, and the quality of the resulting system is poorer because the bots feed largely on newbies. Only when you master the gauntlet of robot overlords do you eventually get welcomed into the inner sanctum of humanity. Those who stay will be always watched over by the machines, and only a few in the Wikipedia elite will master the necessary skills to automatically patrol the recent changes based on their programming efforts.</p>

<p>Inspired by a fascinating talk at <a href="http://icos.umich.edu">ICOS</a> by Wikimedia Foundation researcher <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~halfak/">Aaron Halfaker</a>, who might come to different conclusions from the same data.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>How do you produce so much writing? It is simple. All you have to do is sit down every single day and write.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a daily deadline to focus the mind.</p>

<p>Weblogs do not impose an external deadline. No editor is asking you when your work is going to be ready, and no producer is going to feed you copy. It is just you up against the elements, bravely typing away alone and hoping that your focus is not distracted by systems problems.</p>

<p>Writing all the time is a habit. Some parts of the writing week are easy, when it is just you talking to the page and getting fully formed thoughts out as fast as the keyboard or screen will let you. Other days it's a struggle just to come up with anything that anyone would possibly want to read again.</p>

<p>The weblog is a mature writing format. The tools are not evolving, and new startups are not appearing with whizzy new high concept takes on the form. The fancy new school tools are for essayists (Medium) or for micro bloggers (Ello). I am happy to see incremental improvements at Typepad to make responsive designs easier to put together, but that is a refinement and not an evolutionary change.</p>

<p>Due to an unfortunate incident with a cup of coffee, my medium of choice at the moment is a mobile phone browser. The small screen gives me about a paragraph of text as context for my writing, and the input box on Typepad's dashboard is just competent enough to make this no harder than it should be.</p>

<p>I think about other things I wish I did every day, knowing full well that there are only so many daily habits you can sustain. Facebook wants to catch you every day on the birthday treadmill, your dentist wants you to floss your teeth, the pedometer wants to be logged, the dishes washed, the cats fed u.s.w. My morning wants a cup of coffee, and the daily coffee and WiFi lends itself to blogging. </p>

<p>I aspire to being a daily blogger, but I am not one. It is good to have goals.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Did I just complain about address books? Well let me complain again.</p>

<p>My addressbook asks for a random() function. It needs to surprise me from time to time, showing me individuals who aren't going to show up in a search, but who nonetheless are worthy of remembering right now.</p>

<p>My addressbook needs a search by location function, so that I can pan and zoom over geography and figure out who I know where and who's nearby enough but not in the same city. I know this is possible, but I haven't seen it done either on my phone or on the web.</p>

<p>My addressbook wants to have better links between people, so that I can surf sideways among relationships. It wants to vacuum up all sorts of material from my inbox and then present it intelligently so that I can ask it things.</p>

<p>My addressbook is in dire need of cleaning up, as connections go stale and email addresses change and memories fade. </p>

<p>Frankly, something needs to play the role of <a href="http://capitolfile-magazine.com/living/articles/secrets-of-the-social-secretaries">social secretary</a>, nudging me to remember things, making lists of who should sit next to whom and who doesn't get invited, helping me figure out how to get the call through. I'm afraid that nothing I've ever touched that helps me keep track of people has ever done anything close to what I imagine a skilled person can do in that role.</p>

      <p>My address book fails me, in that it does not have any same way to encode the best way to reach someone.</p>

<p>Should I just call? Is it best to confirm that you are not busy now? Do you so instant message, Twitter DM, some other single purpose system that you are always available on? Should I revert to email to schedule something for later?</p>

<p>It is always appropriate to send a postcard, but I have not figured out how to make that an instant process, not that it really wants to be.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I am operating with the limitation that I do not currently have a full sized keyboard and screen. The laptop accidentally ingested a cup of coffee. It is getting dried out and the bad bits reclaimed now, and in the meantime I am doing all my computing on either library computers or my Nexus 4 phone.</p>

<p>It is often awkward to compose messages and to write on such a small screen, but the screen size is not really the problem. What is much harder is the single finger worth of on screen keyboard that I have to get used to. I type really fast with all ten fingers and the small swipe keyboard on the phone is just slower and more error prone and more cumbersome. This affects my thinking too as I do not have a way to write as fast as I think.</p>

<p>The mobile web is surprisingly functional. Responsive design means that many web sites are readable on a small screen, and the plethora of app designs generally work pretty well. The mobile web however is better for very short messages (LOL BRB) and for consuming info and for executing simple commands. It is not designed for the essayist.</p>

<p>I have looked at a bunch of writing environments, and surprisingly this input window in the Typepad mobile app is one of the better off them. If there is a "word processor" for Android I have not found it yet. Instead I am ending up writing with only Markdown as a formatting language, and I am not using even that. Plain text all the way in a simple browser edit input window.</p>

<p>Writing in the small is possible, but it is not fun. I am looking forward to getting a full sized keyboard again.</p>

<p>(Note to self, the cup of coffee should always be to the far right of the keyboard, not on the near left.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Here's a design for a low overhead way to post about events coming up in Ann Arbor. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/a2events">@a2events on Twitter</a> if you want to play along.</p>

<p>The first rule of business is that every event has to have a URL, and the more simple and direct the URL is the more likely it is that it's authoritative for the event. If an event doesn't have a URL yet, I'll blog about it here if I need to post about it.</p>

<p>The second rule of business is that I'm not keeping a calendar, just a feed, and the feed is not going to be a 100% comprehensive feed; you have to be prepared to get events info from multiple sources and I'm just one of them.</p>

<p>The third rule of business of course is that if you want to pay for this service we'll find a way to let you pay, though the specifics are TBD.</p>

<p>My basic idea for technology is to use a tag on my Pinboard account to feed a specific tag, and to use that tag to feed IFTTT to feed Twitter so that events get pushed out. I'll probably also use a Node-RED page to help construct something that does the right thing, and there will be a Slack channel on the a2b3 slack to do - something.</p>

<p>Thanks to Brian Kerr for having the foresight to reserve the name a2events.</p>
