<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here's a latest try.</p>

<p>There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban:
1. Visualize your work
2. Limit your work-in-progress</p>

<p>I <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/07/personal-kanban-from-jim-benson-and-modus-cooperandi.html">wrote about Personal Kanban before</a> back in 2010, but I didn't try to put it into practice as such.</p>

<p>Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There's a <a href="http://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/boardthing/">review of Boardthing</a> from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it's a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board. The little rectangles each have some text or an image in them, and they can be nested so you can move them around in groups. There's really not much more than that, and it runs in a browser.</p>

<p>This infrastructure is enough to create a Personal Kanban board. Create little rectangles at minimum for "Things to do", "Doing", and "Done", and type into the little rectangles to move them around until you figure out what to do, stop typing, and get something done. I recommend a "Things not to do" rectangle as an added productivity boost.</p>

<p>How does this work in the long term? The system is pretty light weight, and it saves your state between sessions. I suppose if your page gets too cluttered you can start a new one that is more focused. Having a smallish screen forces you to limit your work in progress, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>Dave Gray and Jim Benson have a set of approaches that should work well together, this is mostly written for the both of them as an introduction of sorts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The latest update for Arborwiki is that the database is now hosted on the Localwiki central platform. This gives us updated maps, current software, and additional central hosting support. The cut over was on May 1, 2014.</p>

<p>All of the old Arborwiki URLs still work; you can get to the home page at <a href="http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor">http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor</a> or at <a href="http://arborwiki.org">http://arborwiki.org</a> . We fixed a temporary problem where old URLs with a /city/ prefix stopped working.</p>

<p>One of the things that is clear from the effort is that there's a lot of Ypsilanti content originally hosted at YpsiWiki that could, with the right people, be easily hived off into its own project also under the Localwiki umbrella but with its own home page and look.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A <a href="http://map.jrava.org/">map from the James River Association</a> in Virginia shows the problem: the water intake for the city of Richmond, Virginia is on the James River, downstream from a crude oil spill in Lynchburg, Virginia.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/train-carrying-crude-oil-derails-in-downtown-lynchburg/article_ca91041c-d096-11e3-ae9b-0017a43b2370.html">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one was killed or injured when more than a dozen CSX tanker cars derailed on Wednesday afternoon, but the resulting fire and spill prompted City Manager Kimball Payne to declare an emergency and temporarily evacuate part of downtown.</p>
  
  <p>The spill also prompted Richmond utility officials to prepare to possibly switch to an alternative source for the city’s drinking water supply, which depends primarily on the James. With the river at flood stage, that isn’t likely, said city officials, who plan to use booms to capture any oil nearing the treatment plant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this point, city leaders say there's no need for residents to be alarmed.  Oil booms have been placed in the section of the river where drinking water comes from and the area is being monitored.</p>
  
  <p>"We are going to continually test the water to determine whether or not there is any oil on the downstream side of the booms," says Department of Public Utilities Director Robert Steidel.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the "Paid for by" language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.</p>

<p>I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook. I also looked generally at Google, searching for the phrase in question. The four candidates for the Democratic side of the Ann Arbor mayoral ballot are Stephen Kunselman, Sally Hart Petersen, Sabra Briere and Christopher Taylor.</p>

<p>Stephen Kunselman: while I can find a "Kunselman for Council" web site, I can't locate a "Kunselman for Mayor" web site. The candidate's Facebook page doesn't mention the candidacy that I can see. I haven't seen any ads from the candidate yet. </p>

<p>Sally Hart Petersen: No search results on Google for the mayoral campaign. A Facebook page for the candidate has 294 likes; in the header, it says "Paid for by the Committee to Elect Sally Hart Petersen to Mayor", but that header omits the expected address of the committee. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>Sabra Briere: A search for "Paid for by Sabra Briere for Mayor" generates two pages. The http://sabrabriereformayor.org/ web page has "Paid for by Sabra Briere for City Council" at the bottom, in white type on a yellow background making it virtually unreadable; it also has bunches of Latin text where the real text should be, making me suspicious that it's not real. On Facebook, the page "Vote for Sabra for Ann Arbor Mayor in the Democratic Primary on Tuesday August 5th 2014" has invited 500 people, but has no "Paid for by" disclosure. I haven't seen any ads for the candidate yet.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Sabra Briere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, sabrabriereformayor.org is a non-working website.  A completely different set of pages should be up soon - but in the meantime, I changed the accent yellow to an accent blue - so the white lettering is now higher contrast.</p>
  
  <p>It isn't at all ready to be published, and is just there as filler for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Taylor: A search for "Paid for by Christopher Taylor for Mayor" has 49 results, from the candidate's own web site and from "ngpvanhost". (<a href="http://www.ngpvan.com/">NGP VAN</a> is a campaign website hosting platform for Democrats.) The "Christopher Taylor for Ann Arbor" Facebook page has 686 likes, with no "Paid for by" until you get to the "Contribute" page. Facebook ads for Taylor say "Sponsored", but do not disclose who is paying for them in either the text of the ad or in the image associated with the ad.</p>

<p>UPDATE from Christopher Taylor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that we included the proper disclosure language in the initial ad, but that for some reason it is not appearing. We're on it and will fix it pronto.</p>
  
  <p>I appreciate the notification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are any of these clearcut campaign violations? Probably not. The relevant text of the law is "Any other medium used for campaign purposes shall clearly and unequivocally include the identification or disclaimer, or both, provided in section 47 of the act." Michigan campaign finance law has not been updated to provide specific rules for Facebook (or Twitter), so you can't point to a specific line of text that says "you did this wrong". Without specific guidance, there's wiggle room, and a wait for an opinion from the Attorney General.</p>

<p>Is this "flyspecking", as one candidate described my efforts, or mere "piffle" as another political operative chided me? It's still early in the race, but expectations are that this will be one of the most expensive political races in Ann Arbor mayoral history, with four primary campaigns going and an empty mayoral seat at stake. I fully expect my Facebook timeline and Google search results to be full of paid advertising, and that that advertising will get more and more political as the primary draws near. Close attention to who is paying how much for what is worthwhile, especially in the presence of "free media" like Facebook where you can sent out an unrelenting stream of updates and invites at no obvious direct cost to anyone except the poor reader who just wants to see funny cat videos.</p>

      <p>In my case, that means in part going through my inbox with a sharp eye and saying "can I unsubscribe from this?" I was astounded to figure out just how many times I was able to say "yes" to that question. The hope is that the inbox gets a little bit less cluttered.</p>

<p>I'm sure some marketing department got a little bit sad. Every unsubscribe routine is a little bit different, but the usual drill ends with a plaintive "we're sorry to see you go, did we do something wrong to offend you?" Either you ignore that screen, or you click the politest thing that makes sense to click. Sometimes there's a super-sad follow up automated email, "you're off the list now, did you make a mistake?"</p>

<p>No mistake. I don't need your weekly advertising specials, your cheap flights to places I'm not going to, your chirpy newsletter full of details of events I'm not going to. Trust me, if I need you, I can type your URL into a browser. What I don't need is a daily / weekly reminder that I'm not interested right now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This eulogy was read for my great-uncle Alfio (Auch) by his nephew Zorba. Alfio Vielmetti died in 2008 at the age of 96. I think of him when I am out on my walks, and I miss him when I wish I had someone like him to talk to about city council.</p>

<p>AUCH</p>

<p>My uncle Alfio lived a life centered on family and community, with lessons learned hard in early years, and applied for a very long lifetime. Many of these lessons came from his father, Max, and Max didn't discuss, he announced the lessons - and in some cased, how they were going to be learned. One of the earliest and strongest was sharing, and with seven siblings, there was plenty of constant reinforcement.</p>

<p>Brothers worked to help one another –to be there when needed- after all, Auch had an older brother named Rock. They all worked as kids, then as students at Ann Arbor- always working. Always remembering the hard times- that when they were kids, their shoes were stored once the weather turned warm- and they stayed there until the fall. Working for the iceman- that was tough work for a kid, but it helped make for a pretty tough kid.</p>

<p>Auch had a real love of working with his hands- building things, fixing things- his own, but also for others. He’d show up with the right tools to get a project going – or finished. He was generous with his time and talents- right down to answering a lot of questions from hyper-inquisitive nephews who wanted to build things too. He built a cottage at Spread Eagle pretty much from the dirt up, and helped Howard and Mitch keep their places going across the lake.</p>

<p>He was always providing for the family- building things, fixing things, making things better.</p>

<p>There was great pain in his earlier years, with the death of his wife Marge during the birth of his son David, but he found a new partner in Lois and with her support rebuilt the Vielmetti family home over 7 years down to the smallest detail –building the '''components''' of the smallest details., while building a business and partnering with his brother on various ventures.</p>

<p>Auch was a lifelong supporter of this church, not just going to mass every day and helping out financially, but working with Father Mark on the history of the parish and helping to identify folks in pictures and stories. He had a prodigious memory in regard to the people and history of Norway.</p>

<p>One of Auch’s fathers great commitments in life was to education- and as usual, Max walked the walk, sending every one of his children to the university of Michigan. Auch took it to heart as well, checking in on the next generation- verifying mid-story to see if they indeed knew the meaning of some of his terms and references, as well as founding standing scholarships at the Norway-Vulcan High School.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was at the hospital visiting Auch while he was recovering from cancer surgery, and before he unloaded on the doctors and staff about what they did right- the surgery; and what they did wrong, everything else; and how he was going home that day, regardless of what they thought, that he had his nephew and Jack Osborne there to spring him- well before all that, we talked about charity. No- that’s not quite right- I mostly listened. I listened as he told me of the importance of having charity in your life- in a very broad sense –in that we are all in this together, and that you owed something as your share- your contribution to your family, your friends, your town, and your country.</p>

<p>He pitched in on every level- from installing a new pump at our cottage, to establishing scholarships at the high school, to spending years following Patton across Europe during the war. He spoke of the easier kinds of charity- where you could send a check to folks doing good deeds here and there in the community- the world, and the closer in version- the one where you showed up, spent some time and effort to help out. The one where you had to get up, and get out.</p>

<p>In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us. He walked every day to the library to read the WSJ, he walked to the stores and the bowling alley, and also, You see, on a lot of his walks, he went to sundry houses and visited the sick and the infirm- just a stop in to see how they were doing- and to cheer them up he said. Now if he was on tear about the city council, I’m not certain how cheery it was, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The walking tours made for better health through exercise - as well as better health through helping others.</p>

<p>Auch was a good man who has left a rich legacy by example, and a lot of us are going to miss him.</p>

<p>I used to belong to the Vacuum Cleaners Collector Club a few years back.  I live in Ann Arbor on the west side, and am interested in selling off my Vacuum collection.  I am hoping you may know of some people who may be interested, since I am no longer in the club. </p>

<p>I have about 60 vacuums, dating back to the “coffee can Hoovers.”  I donated a couple to the Hoover Museum when I went to the Hoover 100th anniversary a few years back.  I have mostly Hoovers (60, 61, 62, etc), and an Electrolux G that is in practically showroom condition with all of the attachments including the power head and turbo floor scrubber.  I also have a 1205 that works well.  I’ve got a Rainbow (around 1993) and some older Kirbys (D-50, D-80, Classic III 2C and Legend).  I also have some newer Miele’s that work very well. </p>

<p>The main reason for me selling is that I need the space in the basement, and need some $$ for home repair.  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've unsubscribed from a local politics mailing list that I've been on for a while. Out of an abundance of not wanting to name names, I'm not naming names; chances are there's one of these in your community too.</p>

<p>The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There's a list owner, who sets the rules. One of the rules is that the list is a private list, with no reporters on it and no one is supposed to share anything they get from the list to anyone who's not on the list. Occasionally someone transgresses and they get visibly kicked off the list. A number of small-time politicians are on the mailing list, and it's run by a former elected official.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how I ever got on the list, but I stayed on it. I didn't feel like I could contribute anything to it, because if I was outed as a blogger I'm sure I'd be kicked off. And I couldn't copy anything from it to anyone else (even though I did from time to time). </p>

<p>Small town politics can be very small and very bitter. The straw that broke the camel's back was whining that there wasn't enough parking near Farmer's Market downtown, since apparently walking 5 minutes to an enormous structure nearby wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Not my clowns, not my circus. My inbox is full enough as is. If I need to read this particular list, I'll just FOIA the contents of the inboxes of the elected officials that subscribe to it.</p>

<p>(shakes dust off shoes)</p>

      <p>Getting things done includes deciding what not to do. In my case, it's a matter of going through my todo list and striking off the well-intentioned tasks from two or three months ago that took a moment to write and that would take hours to complete.</p>

<p>I'm better off at accomplishing things when there are fewer undone things to choose from.</p>

<p>Janet Choi writes about the <a href="http://99u.com/articles/24875/the-art-of-the-done-list-harnessing-the-power-of-progress">done list</a> for 99u.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you do anything you consider useful, however small a win it may be, write it down on your done list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can lead to the purposeful behavior of writing something on your todo list just to cross it off and mark it done. The system I'm using doesn't easily distinguish between the three states of "did and then wrote it down", "wrote it down and did it later", or "wrote it down and decided not to do it later". But that's a quibble.</p>

      <p>The latest in cryptocurrencies is the Juggalocoin, proposed to handle the transactional needs of the fans of the Insane Clown Posse. From <a href="http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6049084/meet-the-insane-coin-posse-juggalos-get-their-own">Billboard</a> (because after all this is an entertainment story):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoop whoop! A very tech-savvy Juggalo by the name of Papa Nutt has taken it upon himself to create a cryptocurrency specifically for Faygo-chugging devotees of "the Family" to buy goods and services with*, especially at the upcoming Gathering of the Juggalos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the acid test of any coin: can you buy Faygo with it? From <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/09/juggalocoins_the_cryptocurrency_for_insane_clown_posse_fans.html">Slate</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems quite possible this is all a good joke, but given the purchasing power of the Juggaloes, the Faygo company might want to update its payment system just to be safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=568484.0">Bitcointalk</a>, someone who calls themself "Juggalocoin" launches into a spirited defense of the currency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To reach the huge non-crypto masses requires something they can identify with.  Dogecoin did it.  Kinda.  In a weird, fleeting way.  Doge is just a glimpse of what's possible.  But memes have a VERY limited lifespan.  Doge may grow beyond the meme.  I don't know.  But with Juggalos, it's not about a meme.  It's about a community.  A community that already exists, and has been around for over 20 years!  </p>
  
  <p>This is the innovation that JuggaloCoin offers:  A coin that appeals to a very specific, very tight community.  A community of over 1 million people.  We are offering a real opportunity for crypto to dramatically increase its reach.</p>

  <p>The constant changes have muddled The Ann Arbor News’s identity and, according to some residents, eroded its standing as the go-to source of news in the community.

  <p>David Lampe spent a good six months fighting The Ann Arbor News at every single point of our academics and athletics investigation. He is a well-paid professional spinner for the biggest organization you cover.

      <p>The <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/news/sick-of-web-comments-us-too-heres-what-were-doing-about-it/">Chicago Sun-Times</a> has given up on publishing reader comments on its stories, at least for now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting this weekend, the Chicago Sun-Times and the other titles in the Sun-Times Media group will temporarily cease to run comments with our articles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? If you've read newspaper comments, you'll know why already: they are awful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world of Internet commenting offers a marvelous opportunity for discussion and the exchange of ideas. But as anyone who has ever ventured into a comment thread can attest, these forums too often turn into a morass of negativity, racism, hate speech and general trollish behaviors that detract from the content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes time, effort, energy, and love to engage with readers enough to make the stream of their comments to be anywhere near as worthwhile to read as the professionally produced stories that sit at the top of the page. Too often the news organization treats comments as an afterthought, or if they do think about it they are woefully unprepared to handle the burden.</p>

<p>It hasn't always been the case, of course. Once upon a time (he says, shaking his cane) the letter to the editor was carefully edited, double checked for identity, and only run with some consideration. For the most part, newspapers have given up on their opportunity to corral the best of public discussion into their own pages, leaving it instead for the idiots on parade.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/April-2014/Turning-Internet-Comments-into-Dialogue-Isnt-Easy-or-Cheap/">Chicago Magazine</a> understands the cost of turning reader contributions into something useful.</p>

      <p>Facebook is changing; in this particualr case it's a reorganization of the messaging functions into their own app. From <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/facebook-messenger-or-the-highway/">Techcrunch</a>, the predictable cries of frustration from people who are used to what they have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Still, a unilateral forced migration is the exact kind of change Facebook users hate, and this will only breed more paranoia that their social network could change without their consent. Taking a slower “We’re switching everyone eventually, so you might as well do it now” approach might have gone over better than “Your familiar chat interface will be destroyed in two weeks whether you like it or not”.</p>

<p>We don't like it when our telescreen is changed.</p>

<p>The telescreen is from George Orwell's 1984. An <a href="http://www.theorwellreader.com/excerpt.shtml">excerpt</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plate commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You have to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. </p>

      <p>Every day, read the email. Answer, as best you can, yesterday's email. The <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today.html">yesterbox</a> technique helps out, though it's not perfect.</p>

<p>Follow interesting people on Twitter, but not too many interesting people. Manage the tricky relationship of "friending" people on Facebook, knowing full well once you have befriended someone it's a huge social transgression to unfriend them, even if you don't care for their particular brand of cat videos or politics. Post something clever enough frequently enough.</p>

<p>Attend to the matter of staying in touch with people who are a long ways away, hoping that they will come to town during travel season. I have been using <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/contactually-an-early-review-of-this-contact-manager.html">Contactually</a> to help me sort through making sure that people don't completely drop off the map. Every day I could reanimate a half dozen old relationships; I'm lucky to do that once a week. </p>

<p>Somewhere all in here, post to this blog. I think I've reached the era of peak blogging. This site has steady state traffic that's not overwhelming, and if I want to get comments on something it's easier to post to Facebook. I keep posting out of a sense of diligence, because I've been doing it for a long time, and because there are some things that you need to be diligent about even if there is no obvious reason why.</p>


  <h3>7 April 2014</h3>
      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-07-how-are-you-going-to-keep-them-down-on-the-farm-after-theyve-seen-5d/">How are you going to keep them down on the farm, after they&#39;ve seen 5D?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game "2048". (No, I won't link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating <a href="http://cesarkawakami.github.io/2048-5D/">2048 5D</a> I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. </p>

<p>5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it. You use the arrow keys to navigate in small steps, AWSD to navigate in larger steps, and QE for the largest steps. Of course the steps aren't really larger when you consider the full dimensions of the space, but based on how the cells are laid down on a flat screen that's a reasonable approximation.</p>

<p>After successfully navigating a 5D space, the traditional presentation of a list as a scrolling 1-dimensional space, or even a web browser's narrow navigational confines, seems impossibly small. I can page up and down in a browser, but what would it mean to page left and right? Or to page in and out, or hither and yon? (Pick some more navigational opposites.) Tabs help a little bit for the left-right navigation, and windows perhaps are the in-out method, but what of hither and yon?</p>

<p>Here's a small proposal. The browser could keep track not just of the history of which pages you have seen in the past, but also the order that you've seen them in. Over time, that flow history turns into a graph of expected page transitions. Your browser could respond to some command that was "show me the next page I'm likely to go to", and that would be inferred by the history mechanism. The "next" button would always be active.</p>

<p>I suppose this is related to my routine preference for guided randomness in my work. I would rather not try to work my way down a list where I decide explicitly what to do next. Rather, the computer uses some algorithm to select a next thing (a roll of the dice, or some weighted choice) and that's the next thing to do. With the right sorts of dimensional logic, there could be a couple of different things that would be reasonably "next" and they would be surprising but plausible next things to work through.</p>

<p>What's kind of sad is that the hyperspace of my idealistic youth - where the network was big, and you used spatial metaphors to zoom down information pathways of your own choosing - has been replaced by the UIs of Facebook, Twitter, or even email where the "read the top, refresh, read the top again" is what you're guided down. There's no more chasing down endless hyperlinks - everything you might want is predigested and put in front of you, and if you don't like it you can just hit refresh like some slot-machine player and hope for better.</p>

<p>So I want some space to work in, not just lists, and not just read from the top. Let me decorate rooms with ideas, and traverse some kind of non-linear structure to get from one idea to the next. Vannevar Bush's "memex" had trails that led through it, and it didn't pretend that you could instantly go from one idea to the next without passing through something else. When I think I want to carve out some space for thinking, and have it be something other than the infinite scrolling list. </p>

<p>Developed in 2008 by Brian Solis, The [Conversation Prism] is a visual map of the social media landscape. It’s an ongoing study in digital ethnography that tracks dominant and promising social networks and organizes them by how they’re used in everyday life.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2009/05/the-conversation-prism-as-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-a2b3-lunch.html">In 2009</a>, I wrote up how the a2b3 lunch organizes itself through the eye of the this system. I ran across it again, and decided to do a repeat.</p>

<p>[Conversation Prism]; https://conversationprism.com
* Social networks: Facebook, Yahoo Groups</p>

<p>You'll see Yahoo Groups show up in lots of the entries, because the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 mailing list</a> is the heart and soul of the whole effort. Facebook plays second fiddle, with a lot less people watching the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2207503206/">a2b3 group on Facebook</a>, and a lot less traffic to that group.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog: Typepad</li>
</ul>

<p>See the a2b3 <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/a2b3">category on my Typepad blog</a> . Mostly the specific thing that gets blogged about is the a2b3 lunch non-summaries, which I like going back to but which also take enough time to do that I don't always do them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crowd Wisdom: Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
<li>Questions and answers: Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>The crowd is good about answering almost any reasonable question you throw at it, either at lunchtime or on the mailing list, and coming up with an answer. We don't need Quora or their ilk to get a good answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments: Disqus, Yahoo Groups, lunch conversation</li>
</ul>

<p>I converted over this Typepad install to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/03/the-next-major-change-for-this-weblog-is-converting-over-comments-to-disqus.html">Disqus comments</a>, but really, the comments are in the discussions on the mailing list and over lunch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social commerce: ?</li>
<li>Social marketplace: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>No one yet has found a reason or a compelling method to sell things to each other, which is fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social streams: Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an <a href="http://twitter.com/a2b3">@a2b3 twitter feed</a> that I very occasionally post to which has 500+ followers and only 150+ tweets. There's an opportunity to improve on that effort. If I could, I would automatically tweet out the stream from Meetup, but I haven't figured out yet how IFTTT plays with Meetup.</p>

<ul>
<li>Location: Meetup, Foursquare</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/">a2b3 Meetup</a> answers the question of "where is lunch going to be", and provides nice maps. It's the one piece of the 2009 landscape that was missing, and I'm happy with the results. Foursquare answers the question of "where do you eat lunch". I put together a [map of recent a2b3 lunch spots on Foursquare] without too much work. Perhaps I'll start checking in on Foursquare.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nicheworking: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>What is this I don't even.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enterprise: Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>The enterprisiest tool I have for lunch is the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/02/slack-first-impressions.html">a2b3 Slack instance</a>, a closed system (you're invited, just ask) which does chat (a la IRC) and newsfeed syndication. It's great as a tool, but it's not just the right fit for this particular group.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wiki: Arborwiki (Localwiki)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://localwiki.org">Localwiki</a> is a perfect fit for a local lunch group, because you can stash away answers to questions about the area as they come up and then refer back to them later as needed. <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> has been running for 8+ years and has been a tremendous asset to a2b3.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion and forums: Yahoo Groups</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 Yahoo Group</a> is the key to the whole system. Without it, I guess I'd reconstruct a mailing list with Google Groups. Please don't ever ruin it, Yahoo!</p>

<ul>
<li>Business: LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<p>LinkedIn groups can be tedious to manage, and their discussion forums never took off. However, it's an easy way to read people's resumes, so there's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups?featured=&amp;gid=36174">a LinkedIn group for a2b3</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Service networking: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what this is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't need a separate review system when <a href="http://arborwiki.org">Arborwiki</a> is there to either catch reviews or at least to point to same on Yelp. For real-time reviews in response to queries, there's the Yahoo group. Who's Angie?</p>

<ul>
<li>Social curation: Pinterest</li>
</ul>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/vielmetti/a2b3/">add a map to a Pinterest board</a>, you can pin Foursquare locations and their photos. So I did.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video: Youtube, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a "how to organize lunch" video from Ignite Ann Arbor 3.</p>

<p><iframe width="600" height="450" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/a5BS9_-UAYo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<ul>
<li>Content / documents: a2docs (Scribd)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://a2docs.org">a2docs</a> is a place to stash government records for the Ann Arbor area. It's powered by <a href="http://www.scribd.com/A2Docs/documents">Scribd</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Events: Meetup</li>
</ul>

<p>Meetup is new to the group since 2013. Over the span of 6 months I've used it to organize two dozen events. Meetup is a little bit pricy for what you get, but they have timing for meetup updates down pat and a very low-impact way of keeping people informed. Join the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/a2b3-lunch/">a2b3 Meetup</a> to get weekly announcements of lunch locations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Music: Soundcloud</li>
</ul>

<p>The official a2b3 chime (played at 12:30pm on Thursdays) is hosted on Soundcloud.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97501588&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<ul>
<li>Livecasting: Ustream</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't livecast meetings as a rule, but if we did, it would probably be through Ustream which I've used for other events.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social bookmarks: pinboard.in</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://pinboard.in/t:a2b3">a2b3 tag on pinboard</a> captures bookmarks. Bookmarking is not from this decade, and thus it's not religiously kept up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Influence: Klout, I guess</li>
</ul>

<p>I only say this because former a2b3 regular Joe Cothrel works at Lithium, which just acquired Klout.</p>

<ul>
<li>Quantified self: ?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all about keeping track of what you do (e.g. tracking exercise with a pedometer or a phone) and sharing that with yourself or the world. Several people in the group do this but we haven't all coalesced on any single platform to share.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This interview of Douglas Perlin, author of the <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/03/a2parking-app-provides-android-users-with-access-to-real-time-information-about-ann-arbor-parking-st.html">a2parking</a> Android application for locating Ann Arbor parking structures, was done via email. It is lightly edited to include hyperlinks.</p>

<ol>
<li>When did you get the idea to do an a2parking application, and how long did it take you to go from idea to first version?</li>
</ol>

<p>In October or November 2011 I was looking at the <a href="http://a2dda.org">a2dda website</a> and happened to see the parking space availability on one of the pages.  I thought it would be nice to have a phone app that could pull up the parking availability data..  It took about a week or two to get the first version up on google play. The original version was kind of clunky I used <a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a> to extract the data from a2dda web page and wrote a little code to clean it up.  </p>

<ol>
<li>How long has the software been out in the world?</li>
</ol>

<p>The app was first published to google play on November 11, 2011.  Sometime around the opening of the new Library Lane parking structure the data and web page disappeared.  I guess a2dda or Republic Parking was upgrading the system.  I guess sometime around August 2013 the <a href="http://www.a2dda.org/map/AADDACount.json">data was made available through a JSON link</a> but I wasn’t aware of it at that time.  For some reason in early March of this year I was thinking about removing the spaces page since it was coming up blank and just leaving the navigation page.  I logged into my Google app.things account and there was an email from Republic Parking informing me about the JSON data so I decided to upgrade the app and that's what you see now.</p>

<ol>
<li>Who do you envision as using the system?</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess I never really thought about it.  Probably someone from out of town looking for directions to parking structure. </p>

<ol>
<li>Have you talked at all to the DDA or to Republic Parking?</li>
</ol>

<p>I never talked to anyone at DDA or Republic Parking.  I did send email to DDA from my regular email account to find out what happened to the data in when it disappeared.  I got a quick response letting me know that the system was being upgraded.  The thing that really surprised me was when my app.things account received and email from Republic Parking with the JSON link information since I never really wrote to them and my email to the DDA was from a different account.  Not sure how they found out about the app.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there more information you'd like to gather regarding parking data (e.g. pricing, trending of availability, historical or predictive numbers)?</li>
</ol>

<p>The menu has an information screen choice which lists structures and lots and when one is tapped it will pull hours and pricing from the JSON link.  I’m not really tracking the trends or making predictions.</p>

<ol>
<li>What's your favorite parking place? Your favorite free place to park?</li>
</ol>

<p>Hahaa! I’m a local. I’m pretty good at finding free places to park. That being said I prefer to take the bus and cabs when I come into town since its way cheaper than a DUI.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell a little bit about yourself and how you got started programming.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m retired. I was a Network Administrator/Network Security Officer for many years.  Programming is just a hobby and I’m pretty much of a hack at it since I don’t devote a lot of time to it. I started programming on an Apple II in basic. Then as time passed I moved on to more languages like Pascal, C, perl, and then Java. In the case of the parking app I just wanted to learn how to write a phone app.</p>

<p>Dan Romanchik, KB6NU will be conducting the next One-Day Tech Class will be held on Saturday, May 3, 2014 from 9am to 3pm at  the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, 220 E. Ann St. Ann Arbor, MI 48104.  Immediately after the class, the Technician Class license exam will be administered. </p>

<p>Pre-registration is required, and there is a $10 fee to take the class. We often fill the class and have to put people on the waiting list. So, if you'd like to take this class, you should send a check or money order sooner rather than later to reserve their spot. Dan's address is 1325 Orkney Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. People can also pay via PayPal by sending $10 to cwgeek@kb6nu.com.</p>

<p>There is also a $15 fee to take the test. This fee is payable to the volunteer examiners just before they take the test. DO NOT send me the $15 exam fee.</p>

<p>Prospective students can download the study guide from <a href="http://www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual">www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual</a>. Read through it a couple of times and take some online practice tests (URLs for practice test websites can be found in the study guide) before taking the test.  They greatly increase the chances that you will pass the test if you do some studying beforehand.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please send an email to cwgeek@kb6nu.com or phone Dan at 734-930-6564.</p>
