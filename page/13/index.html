<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

<p>A review of <a href="http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/\">Social Physics</a>: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.</p>

<p>Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. Quite evidently the populations they study live routine, predictable lives. (Perhaps we all do.)</p>

<p>My biggest criticism (&amp; thus the non-recommendation for the book) is that the technologies for making these monitoring of human behavior that Pentland describes are dehumanizing and a grave insult to personal privacy. The authors vague promises of a personal data store that would broker our most personal information are unrealistic. If these plans pan out, we will always be watched over by machines that seek only to predict our patterns of behavior and exploit them. An <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/welcome-to-algorithmic-prison/283985/">algorithmic prison</a> awaits us.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the author describes unexpected behavior by individuals thus modeled, and betrays an element of surprise that we might step out of our everyday paths into something his system doesn't contain. It's a glimmer of hope in a dystopian world that we might surprise our ever-present overseers and do something that their social physics does not anticipate.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Mr. Jim Doyle, a long time Lower Burns Park resident, passed away late last month at the Grand Rapids VA.  Mr. Doyle had lived at 1023 Granger Ave. for over 50 years. He served in the Philippines on General MacArthur's staff during the war.  After the war, Mr. Doyle returned to Ann Arbor where after the passing of his parents, he spent the majority of his adult life taking care of his younger brother who was severely disabled. </p>

<p>Some of you may remember Mr. Doyle from the efforts to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060727194215/http://www.ewashtenaw.org/news/2006/doyle_home.html/Assets/aa_news_james_doyle.pdf">refurbish his house</a> by Veteran groups back in 2006.  Mr. Doyle was a friendly man who always had a smile on his face and a penchant for whole milk and chocolate candy bars.</p>

<p>Thanks to Graydon Krapohl for the information.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> has had a series of bad days. Their site has been under a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for a number of days. To mitigate the problem, they are using the <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> service, but even that has not been working great.</p>

<p>The net effect is that sometimes the Meetup.com site is unavailable, making it hard to sign up or schedule or reschedule events. The Meetup periodic announcements about the problem emphasize how hard they are working to fix it and how user credit cards are not at risk.</p>

<p>I've been happily using Meetup to organize the <a href="http://meetup.com/a2b3-lunch">A2B3 weekly Thursday lunch series</a> that I run, as well as a monthly <a href="http://meetup.com/a2civictech">Ann Arbor civic technology meetup</a> and a monthly Web Analtyics Wednesday meetup. Of the three, only the a2civictech group doesn't really have any other infrastructure; the other two have existing web sites or mailing lists to carry on even if meetup is down.</p>

<p>I wish Meetup well and look forward to them sorting out the problems they are having. The <a href="http://meetupblog.meetup.com/">Meetup blog</a> is a source of news, as is the <a href="https://twitter.com/meetup">Meetup twitter account</a>.</p>

      <p>I organize lunch on Thursdays every week, and I ask my lunch group a question so that people can say a few words after they introduce themselves. This week the food was at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Taco_King">Taco King</a> (yummy) and the question was about new apps for people's phones that they added, or apps that they uninstalled. It was a good way to get some insight into the new parts of the net that are explored only through apps.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The latest in the Bitcoin saga is a crisis at Mt Gox, one of the major Bitcoin exchanges in the world. A few judicious news clippings will give you a sense of the chaos.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Bitcoinity-mt-gox-crash" title="Bitcoinity-mt-gox-crash" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d81b1f9970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/26/us-mtgox-website-idUSBREA1O07920140226">Reuters</a>: Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox goes dark in blow to virtual currency</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The website of Mt. Gox suddenly went dark on Tuesday with no explanation, and the company's Tokyo office was empty - the only activity was outside, where a handful of protesters said they had lost money investing in the virtual currency.</p>
  
  <p>Hours later, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told Reuters in an email: "We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell much more for now as this also involves other parties." He did not elaborate on the details or give his location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/business/apparent-theft-at-mt-gox-shakes-bitcoin-world.html?_r=0">New York Times</a>: Apparent Theft at Mt. Gox Shakes Bitcoin World</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday night, a number of leading Bitcoin companies jointly announced that Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for most of Bitcoin’s existence, was planning to file for bankruptcy after months of technological problems and what appeared to have been a major theft. A document circulating widely in the Bitcoin world said the company had lost 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft that had gone unnoticed for years. That would be about 6 percent of the 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document circulating widely is this <a href="http://two-bit-idiot.tumblr.com/post/77760399932/update-on-mt-gox-this-document-appears-to-be">crisis plan</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that “transaction malleability” caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it. Gox’s own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years. The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The underlying problem is "transaction malleability", and how Mt Gox's software didn't account for it when approving trades. From Ed Felten's <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/understanding-bitcoins-transaction-malleability-problem/">Freedom to Tinker</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been known since roughly 2011 that signed transactions are slightly “malleable” in the sense that it is possible to modify a signed transaction in certain minor ways, without invalidating the signature. The critical details about payment—who is paying how much, and to whom—can’t be changed, but certain peripheral information can be modified in a way that causes the transaction ID to change. [Technical detail for crypto nerds: This happens because the transaction ID is computed by hashing a set of fields that is a superset of the fields covered by the signature.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mostly dormant crypto nerd in me rolls my eyes, but of course this was not an obvious problem to those first looking at Bitcoin. I don't know off hand if other cryptocoins like Dogecoin have the same transaction malleability flaw.</p>

<p>Obituary: Richard "Rich" Walker Wiggins (February 28, 1956 - February 8, 2014) </p>

<p>Passed away February 8, 2014 in Holt, MI. Born Feb. 28th, 1956, in Chicago, IL, and raised in Decatur, AL, Rich was a proud son of a chief engineer of NASA's Skylab Space Station. A high achiever throughout his life, Rich attended <a href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>, where he worked later for many years as a systems programmer and manager, retiring as a Senior Information Technologist in 2010. Always a visionary, Rich will be remembered primarily as a champion of the Internet -- speaking, teaching, and publishing about its potential. An outstanding communicator, he wrote one of the earliest books about the Internet -- "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Internet-Everyone-Providers-Workstation/dp/0070670196">The Internet for Everyone: A Guide for Users and Providers</a>", published by McGraw-Hill in 1994. The vanity plate on his car? "INTRNET".</p>

<p>Rich was consulted by and featured in numerous national media venues, including The New York Times (his beloved, must-read newspaper). Local TV and radio stations called upon him frequently for appearances and commentary. With his good friend Charles Severance, he appeared regularly on a popular segment of <a href="http://wkar.org/">WKAR</a>'s AM 870 NewsTalk radio program, debating contemporary technology topics and giving computer advice to callers. Rich and Chuck also co-hosted a national television program -- "<a href="http://vimeo.com/3776888">Internet: TCI</a>", from 1994-1997. An enthusiastic team leader, Rich played a significant role in moving Michigan State University forward into the new world of the Internet.</p>

<p>Rich was a brilliant, charming and complicated man who made friends everywhere. He was eager to debate politics and discuss the latest news with anyone, and was known as a relentless punster. Warm weather was one of his passions; he could be seen wearing shorts and sandals well into November, adamantly refusing to acknowledge the end of summer. He loved Lake Michigan, Key West, Canada, MSU's Summer Circle plays, the Moody Blues, Wendy's iced tea, and El Azteco. Rich treasured all of his friends, relatives, and colleagues. He is gone from us far too soon.</p>

<p>Rich was preceded in death by his parents, Herbert H. Wiggins, Sr. and Ethel Gardiner Wiggins; and his brothers, David and Herbert Jr. He is survived by numerous cousins.</p>

<p>A Memorial Service will be held Saturday, March 1, 2014 at Palmer, Bush &amp; Jensen Family Funeral Homes Holt-Delhi Chapel, Holt, MI. Visitation will begin at 12:00PM, followed by a 1:00PM service. Friends are invited to gather afterwards for refreshments. In lieu of flowers, Rich requested specifically that donations be made to the Michigan State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital.

<p>I'm trying out <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. Here are some first impressions.</p>

<p>The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks. For the ubergeeks, it also has a very competent IRC client support.</p>

<p>The experience of the system varies tremendously depending on who you have on your team. If they have somewhere else to talk, then you might never get the critical mass you need to have a real conversation online. About a third of the people I'm inviting actually start to use the system, and most of those have some IRC channel time in their background.</p>

<p>The web client and the Android client for Slack are both very capably executed and feel like sound, solid pieces of engineering. It adds a lot of confidence to using the system to have such nice tools to work with.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">integrations</a> configured for RSS feeds, for Github (issues and commits), and for Google Hangouts. There's a rich API, or so it seems, and lots of other systems that have had integrations built for them. I have ambitions but no infrastructure yet to write my own code or better yet borrow other people's code to extend the system. I'm not much more advanced yet than getting the "hello world" style post-to-Slack-from-the-command-line capability going, but it did work, so I have high hopes.</p>

<p>The slack server I have set up is running on their free trial, which has a limited number of integration slots. I think that by cleverly enabling and disabling services that I can try enough of them to build up some experience with the system, but not necessarily run everything in production. I get 5 for free, and Github, Hangouts, RSS, Twitter, and the incoming webhook make up that 5.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what I've built and join in, drop me a line and I can send you an invite.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Depending on the source you get a slightly different story, but the results are the same: there is a lot of volatility in Bitcoin pricing in early February 2014 because of problems at the Mt. Gox exchange. So much for a technologically pristine, mathematically pure, decentralized currency; when your "foreign exchange" depends on a very small number of businesses, it can have systematic vulnerabilities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mt. Gox, the world’s original and once-largest bitcoin exchange, appears to be in a state of disarray after it suspended bitcoin withdrawals to work on what it said were technical issues. Meanwhile, the clamour of angry customer voices is growing.</p>
  
  <p>The exchange’s moves have had a negative impact on the bitcoin markets. The price of 1 BTC plunged from $850 at the start of the week to $681, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, in the wake of the Gox announcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business Insider quotes the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mtgox-halts-withdrawals-2014-2">Mt Gox letter to customers</a> on the freeze in withdrawals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We apologize for the sudden short notice. All bitcoin withdrawal requests will be on pause, and the withdrawals in the system will be returned to your MtGox wallet and can be reinitiated once the issue is resolved. The trading platform will perform as usual for the needs of our customers.   </p>
  
  <p>Our team will resolve this problem as soon as possible and will provide an update on Monday, February 10, 2014 (JST).  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>I'm interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to "listen" to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Fldigi-HB9ERN" title="Fldigi-HB9ERN" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. Here's what I have:</p>

<p><a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">WebSDR</a> from http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/ . This is a software-defined radio tuning  to the radio airwaves at the University of Twente in the Netherlands; it runs in your browser. There are 87 of these systems running around the world, listed at <a href="http://websdr.org/">websdr.org</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html">fldigi</a> from http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html . This software for Windows, Linux and OS X, runs on your local system and takes an audio signal and decodes it in one of many digital modes.</p>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/">Soundflower</a> from https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/ . This is a Mac system extension that allows you to redirect the audio output of one program (e.g. your browser) into the audio input of another program (e.g. fldigi). Not strictly necessary because the fldigi can also just decode whatever it hears through the computer's built in microphone. I picked up the recommendation from an article on <a href="http://www.hamradioandvision.com/websdr-digital-modes/">HamRadioAndVision</a>.</p>

<p>A number of people have done Youtube videos describing what they are doing to make this work. For example, <a href="http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/component/content/article/63-sdr/290-fun-with-websdr-and-fldigi">OZ9AEC</a> has a 6 minute Youtube from 2009 shows reception in single channel and multichannel mode. He doesn't use Soundflower, just the built in mic of his Mac.</p>

<p>Not described here - and probably what I need to figure out next - are two key bits of information. Where do you tune to pick up digital signals? And, more importantly, which decoder do you use? It's not hard to pick out which modulation is being used if you have some practice, but as of this writing I couldn't readily tell you what WEFAX sounds like compared to RTTY. Still sorting through those details before I can claim to have mastered this.</p>

<p>Note also that this should work with a local software-defined radio as well, or even with a "hardware-defined radio" placed near your mic or patched in with a mic cable.</p>

      <p>I'd like to do some long form writing, except that I'd publish it on Twitter. I'll write essays as I'd normally write them, making sure that sentences are 140 characters or less. The goal would be to encapsulate an entire argument in pithy sentences and make each one stand on its own. I have no doubt that it would be possible to write quite a few words this way, though you might lose some followers in the bargain.</p>

<p>The change of pace is that you're not trying to write your whole idea into any given 140 character fragment. You're looking to spin out a story that holds together over dozens of tweets, without being too distracted by the net you're writing within. Writing with a net watching can be distracting, but it can also be enlivening; somehow you must make use of the diversions. Some side conversations will give you ideas that you can later reclaim and recast as your own, when the time is right.</p>

<p>Twitter is a new medium within which to compose original writing, as every sentence you write there has its own URL and feedback loop. By publishing every sentence individually, you can write and then see feedback one line a time - a thought both inspiring and terrifying.</p>

  <p>The fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing. Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been drafting first versions in vim so that I have a record of the whole context of what I'm writing outside of Twitter. Drafting in vim gives me a chance to write a whole paragraph and then push it to Twitter as separate sentences, once it makes sense. I always edit again within Twitter, where every character is counted for you forcing you to make tough decisions about what not to say. The short format of Twitter leads to better writing, since you must omit needless words to make a complex idea fit into its allotment. </p>

<p>My writing is slower when I feel the compulsion to construct an argument that still makes sense when divided into pieces. It's easier to write quickly when you don't have to think about the reaction to every word and phrase. The feedback has prompted a handful of offline drafts before committing to publishing - even "just" to publishing to Twitter. </p>

      <p>February 5, 2014: More than 623,000 customers were without power in the service area covered by PECO (Philadelphia, PA area) at the peak of an ice storm on Wednesday. This is the second worst storm that the company has reported, right behind Hurricane Sandy.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Peco-outage-map-feb-5-2014" title="Peco-outage-map-feb-5-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fcb58299970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

      </h3>
      <p>Does email work anymore as a way to connect people who share the same interests, in the old-school Internet sense of the community that forms around a well-managed, well-moderated mailing list? I'm starting to think after having my inbox fill up with well-intentioned communications that the era of the mailing list is over, and with it the era of any other use for email except the purely transactional.</p>

<p>My email messages are relatively long (compared to IMs or tweets), relatively formal, and carefully composed. A single message will sit in my inbox for more than 24 hours before I feel ready to give it its due. In a world of instant messaging that looks more and more like an anachronism, as though I were pulling out a quill pen to communicate with when everyone else was merrily texting away.</p>

<p>I run some long-running mailing lists, and I've started to itch at the limitations of Yahoo Groups for community engagement and for attracting new people who don't really want their inboxes to fill up with chit-chat. There must be a better way. </p>

<p>(Ironically, I'll probably email this post out to one of those lists, and will get more comments back from the email than I will get from this blog.)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I've redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I'd give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.</p>

<p>You can see it at <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com">http://vielmetti.typepad.com</a>.</p>

<p>So far so good, I guess. I don't have strong preferences about it; the advantage is that more short posts fit on a page, making it easier to scroll through a lot of them. The disadvantage is that I don't know where the 40 word mark is, and there's no really obvious way to say "always excerpt the lead paragraph", which is what I want.</p>

<p>Fiddling with your blog is the traditional way not to write. If I had to fiddle more, I'd look for a design that worked better on mobile devices like my Android phone; the current design has a weird choice of fonts for blog title that comes out too small, and my CSS-fu is not adequate to the task of debugging and fixing it.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-midnight-traffic-jam-january-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a66970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/atlanta-snow-jam-2014-metro-commuters-recount-thei/nc5qF/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. And side streets? Even worse. Some people ditched their vehicles and set out on foot. Others tried to help stranded strangers. And many persevered, moving a few inches an hour toward home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, was set up to help stranded motorists, and it has spawned a <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zCPqWODXYzLY.kQ7WuEIEQXNs">Stranded Driver Shelter Map</a>, a clip of which is below.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" title="Atlanta-snowstorm-stranded-driver-shelter-map-January-28-2014" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d696a7c970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Kroger, Walmart, and Home Depot have opened their stores as shelters, if you can get to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2622">Jeff Masters blog from Weather Underground</a> has the situation in detail.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dangerous winter storm swept through the Deep South on Tuesday, dumping 1 - 4" of snow and 1/4" - 1/2" of ice on a region unused to dealing with severe winter weather. Travel chaos resulted in many cities, and at least nine people died in storm-related accidents. Officially, 2.6" of snow fell at the Atlanta Airport from Winter Storm Leon, and snow amounts across the city ranged from 1.5" - 3.5". But with temperatures in the low 20s, and only 40 snow plows and 30 sand trucks to handle the snow, Atlanta streets and highways quickly turned into parking lots during the afternoon snow, as schools, businesses, and government offices all closed nearly simultaneously, sending a huge number of vehicles onto the roads. Atlanta experienced its worst traffic day of all-time, and thousands of motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles, with many spending the night sheltering in stores, stalled cars, or strangers' homes. A Facebook group dubbed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/397839673695382/">SnowedOutAtlanta</a>, meant to connect stranded motorists with people willing to put them up for the night, had thousands of members by Tuesday night. Hundreds of children never made it home, and were forced to spend the night at their schools or at bus shelters. There were 940 confirmed traffic accidents in Atlanta, with more than 100 involving injuries, according to the Georgia public safety commissioner. It was Atlanta's worst driving day since the infamous Snow Jam of 1982, when 6" of snow also created traffic chaos, stranding thousands of motorists.</p>

<p>I'm rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it's easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.</p>

<p>So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945), David Sucher's "City Comforts" (2003), and <a href="http://www.mbenedikt.com/">Michael Benedikt</a>'s anthology "Cyberspace: First Steps" (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.</p>

<p>The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can't simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.</p>

<p>One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt's "Cyberspace". It's a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there's anything of common use that defines it, it's the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.</p>

<p>I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I'm stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that's true to the work? </p>

<p>One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for "vielmetti benedikt cyberspace" should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.</p>

<p>A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace">Goodreads</a> (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/31259">Librarything</a> (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20">Amazon</a>, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.</p>

<p>For every work, there's some chance that an echo of it will be online too; <a href="http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf">IEU in Turkey</a> has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.</p>

<p>What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? </p>

<p>I've carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What's more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.</p>

<p>An interview with Benedikt in <a href="http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;pff=1">AIGA</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.</p>

<p>I'm (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome. I wrote about it previously; it's an extension that suspends the processes of tabs you mark as inactive, so that they can be restored quickly. As a bonus, it's good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with "only" 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.</p>

<p>The Internet, in its infinite wisdom, has a lot of things competing for our attention. The only problem is that it's easy to save a tab group but as hard as ever to really mark a tab as closed. I'm sure there's some stable working set that I should keep going, but it's also satisfying to <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/01/what-is-the-goal-of-the-internet.html">decrease the n</a> by closing tabs.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>On the morning of 27 January 2014, AT&amp;T UVerse services appear to be suffering from DNS problems. A graph from <a href="http://downdetector.com/status/att">Down Detector</a> suggests that the problem is widespread. The observation is that some sites will load but others won't (like Hulu, New Yorker, Reddit.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Down-detector-att-2014-01-27-10.36.57-AM" title="Down-detector-att-2014-01-27-10.36.57-AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115a9dd6970c-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8). On my Mac, go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced ... > DNS and change the DNS server address.</p>
