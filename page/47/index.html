<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Twitter input box doesn&#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&#39;t pop for it.&#0160;</p>
<p>When a great weird idea hits, you want it to hit a dry jack pine tree on a hot day and make it smoulder. It might take a day for the jack to catch fire, long after the first flash is gone. Use Twitter to fan the flames, not to light the fire.</p>

<hr />
<p>A portion of the jack pine forest is on fire near <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Grayling, MI</span>. Generally, fires of a substantial size get a name; this one is the Howes Lake Wildfire. The reporting started before the name was established so initial reports did not always use consistent naming, and I started with the &#0160;&quot;Howes Lake Fire&quot; name since it was the first name in shared use.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s details from reliable news sources that are likely to continue to have good information, updated at 12:30 am Wednesday.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://michigan.gov/dnr" target="_self">Michigan DNR</a> is sending reports out on Twitter via the <a href="http://twitter.com/michigandnr" target="_self">@MichiganDNR</a>&#0160;account. They started out are using the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23wildfire" target="_self">#wildfire</a>; following that&#0160;will also pick up coverage of the (much larger) fires in Arizona. After a while the report changed to #howeslakewildfire and that&#39;s unique (and the full name of the fire).</p>

<p>Gibb&#39;s Berry Farm in Eaton Rapids (about 60 miles WNW of Ann Arbor) is bringing strawberries to the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. Price was $4.25 /quart on the first week of June, often prices change during the season and dip during peak times when produce is more plentiful.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to a Father&#39;s Day berrypicking trip, which should be about right.

<p>I&#39;ve written about <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/supermemo-repet.html" target="_self">Supermemo</a> before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&#39;t overwhelm.</p>
<p>New to me this week is a similar spaced repetition training tool focused on short term memory. Referred to as &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back" target="_self">N-back</a>&quot; (Wikipedia), it looks at turning the process of matching repetitive items in a sequence into a game, with higher scores if you can recall that e.g. 3 letters ago there was also an &#39;x&#39; in the string. The application <a href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/" target="_self">Brain Workshop</a>&#0160;was created by Paul Hoskinson and lets you play with your current skills; I haven&#39;t seen anyone render this into hardware a la the old game of <strong>Simon</strong>.</p>
<p>To turn the random noise of the world into patterns that you understand and can manipulate and recognize, you need to find the useful connections and build upon them somehow. You can&#39;t just learn by remembering things out of context - it always helps to learn by doing. People love to make things into patterns, and an organized exploration of an otherwise random world can help you make connections which are key to understanding the world.</p>
<p>The space I keep trying to explore is remembering the names of people, some of whom I know rather well by face, others who I know only by their work. The index into this space that lends itself to randomness is the birthday, which you can be pretty sure to capture less than 1% of the set of people every day. Alas, <a href="http://www.letsmovetothemoon.com/facebook-cheapens-birthdays/" target="_self">Facebook has cheapened</a> the opportunity for <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/how-to-remember-birthdays-ed44-edition.html" target="_self">remembering someone&#39;s birthday</a> as a distinguishing mark, so the challenge is to use this somehow else; if I happen to remember your half birthday, it&#39;s because I&#39;m trying to remember and plan both forward and back 6 months. Even better if I send you a half-birthday postcard (to combine two unusual abilities). Wish me luck.</p>

      <p>The NQRT project had its first sighting in the wild at the 2011 Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire. <a href="http://www.ryanburns.info/blog/?p=233" target="_self">Ryan Burns organized a group of passers by to our booth</a> to assemble a pound of sugar cubes into a scannable QR code, and <strong>Jamie Lausch</strong> and I took over mid-way and explained what we had done and helped people make &quot;cootie catchers&quot; with the &quot;Save the date&quot; message for the October 2011 event.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The a2b3 group met at Eastern Accents this Thursday, June 2, 2011. Here&#39;s a summary of sorts.</p>
<p>I took notes in a <a href="http://www.officemax.com/catalog/sku.jsp?skuId=22280666" target="_self">quadrille notebook <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015432b95546970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Picture 1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015432b95546970c" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef015432b95546970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Picture 1" /></a> </a> for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly.</p>
<p>There was a sign in, again which is unusual, and I tried to introduce people rather than having them introduce themselves. That&#39;s hard, but I think it&#39;s totally doable. I&#39;ll eventually learn people&#39;s short self-descriptions to the point where I can do them all myself, a goal in my preparation for the next event.</p>
<p>The meeting ran long, and I missed one of the cardinal principles of a lunch meeting: if people need to leave at a precise time, know that ahead of time so that they can be first to introduce themselves. Apologies to the three people at a table of 18 who didn&#39;t get a chance to speak up.</p>
<p>In the way of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2010/03/meaningless-indicators-of-progress.html" target="_self">meaningless indicators of progress</a> (a recurring theme), there were 3 people new at the table, 1 person newly moved to the area, and 1 person visiting from out of town. As far as I know, there was no one there who was currently a college student, which is unusual and must mean either that it is summertime or that the kids are enjoying <a href="http://www.bankofannarbor.com/soniclunch/" target="_self">Sonic Lunch</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for coming; I feel like I was perhaps a bit over-prepared this time, but I have a lab notebook to record the next meeting as well so I can make things a little better and smoother next time.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Working my way through the rhubarb recipe set, I find variations on what I made tonight, which was stewed rhubarb. If you were to separate the juice from the fruit, you&#39;d get <strong>Rhubarb Syrup</strong>, as seen in <a href="http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/case-study-rhubarb-syrup/" target="_self">the New York Times</a>&#0160;(water, vanilla pod, no sugar), <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/ingredients-fruit/homemade-pantry-rhubarb-syrup-084304" target="_self">The Kitchn</a>&#0160;(4c rhubarb, 1c sugar, 1c water, ginger root), <a href="http://www.foodinjars.com/2009/05/rhubarb-syrup-recipe/" target="_self">Food in Jars</a>&#0160;(more sugar). Use as a flavoring in fizzy water, or in a fizzy drink.</p>
<p><strong>Rhubarb Daisy</strong>, a drink made with this syrup (gin, lemon juice, soda, syrup) is seen in <a href="http://thepauperedchef.com/article/homemade-rhubarb-syrup-and-rhubarb-daisy" target="_self">The Paupered Chef</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>You can use both parts of the straining operation when you&#39;re done with stewed rhubarb. &#0160;Take the now no longer fibrous bits and use as a &quot;rustic jam&quot;; add pectin to the syrup, and you get <strong>Rhubarb Jelly,</strong> a la <a href="http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Rhubarb-Jelly" target="_self">Taste of Home</a>.</p>
<p>If you won&#39;t want to stew the rhubarb down entirely, the <a href="http://www.peoplesfood.coop/recipes/rhubarb.php" target="_self">People&#39;s Food Coop</a> has this recipe for <strong>Rhubarb Poached in Red Wine</strong>, and <a href="http://thebittenword.typepad.com/thebittenword/2009/05/rice-pudding-with-poached-rhubarb.html" target="_self">The Bitten Word</a>&#0160;has a similar recipe pairing the rhubarb with rice pudding. To avoid stewing the rhubarb down entirely, aim for <strong>Roasted Rhubarb</strong>, a la <a href="http://wednesdaychef.typepad.com/the_wednesday_chef/2007/06/rose_grays_and_.html" target="_self">The Wednesday Chef</a>, or a simple recipe from <a href="http://www.doriegreenspan.com/2009/06/-tomorrow-ill-be-going.html" target="_self">Dorie Greenspan</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/arborwiki" target="_self">Arborwiki</a>. Every month deserves at least one wiki posting, and this month I find myself wishing I had written down the simple rule of copy editing with wiki: always link to anything in boldface or caps, and if it doesn&#39;t exist, make it exist by fixing the spelling or creating the page.</p>

<p>Chicago. Why do I have a whole Chicago category, but don&#39;t get there more often? One or the other of those should be fixed. (And ask, since Detroit is so much closer, why the Detroit category is not more full; ditto Lansing.)</p>

<p>Fishing, floods. There were stories of people running into carp on bike paths, people fly fishing for carp, and more hot carp action during the latest Huron River floods. Pictures please!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens, and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.</p>
<p>Coconut-potato curry.</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
<li>Oil for frying</li>
<li>curry powder, to taste</li>
<li>1 can coconut milk</li>
<li>2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done. Reserve some cooking water.</p>
<p>While the potatoes are boiling, fry a chopped onion in some oil on low heat. When the onion smells nice but is not brown, add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant.</p>
<p>Add the coconut milk to the curry mixture and stir until well mixed. Then add the garbanzoes, and cook covered on low heat.</p>
<p>When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garbanzo curry. Cut the potatoes into smaller pieces if they are too large. Keep covered, and add up to 1 cup potato water if the mixture gets too dry.</p>

<p>For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the <a href="http://www.deadschembechlers.com/">Dead Schembechlers</a>. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&#39;s best to have a &quot;holy rivalry&quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &quot;New Wolverine Order&quot;, the &quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&quot;, or the &quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://wunderground.com" target="_self">Weather Underground</a> for radar and forecasts and what not. I like the <a href="http://classic.wunderground.com" target="_self">classic version of the user interface</a>, which is busy and deep and which I know well enough to navigate. The <a href="http://m.wund.com/" target="_self">minimalist mobile version of the site</a>&#0160;is starkly unbusy and works fine even on a relatively dumb smart phone. &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>SKYWARN</strong>, the local ham radio emergency weather channel. The local repeater is&#0160;<a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/N8DUY" target="_self">N8DUY</a>, located near I-94 and M-14 in Scio Township, available at&#0160;145.150&#0160;Mhz or via the&#0160;<a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?action=wp&amp;feedId=5230" target="_self">Radio Reference relay online</a>. This is the single best source of real time news during events.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dteenergy.com/map/outage.html" target="_self">DTE Energy outage map</a>&#0160;is good for tracking storm damage starting about 30 minutes after the storm has gone through - you start to pick up which power outages will take a long time to fix. Note in this map below from Sunday, May 29, 2011, that the storm damage near Lansing ends at the DTE boundary; that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t more storm damage, only that I don&#39;t have a map of the other.</p>

<p><strong>Television</strong>, which we don&#39;t have for over the air reception. WDIV Channel 4 &quot;Click On Detroit&quot; has useful email weather alerts and a <a href="http://detroit.justweather.com/" target="_self">Detroit JustWeather</a> page, and WXYZ Channel 7&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23backchannel" target="_self">#backchannel</a> on Twitter always has good chatter from the news desk there.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>AM/FM radio</strong>. Locally the best bet is <a href="http://weather.detroit.cbslocal.com/auto/wwjtvV4/MI/Detroit.html" target="_self">WWJ &quot;News radio 950</a>&quot;, with traffic and weather together on the 8&#39;s; it&#39;s intended to be listened to while you are driving, and they do talk</p>
<p><strong>Weather band radio, </strong>which speaks in a synthesized scary voice. There are receivers that only turn on when there is an alert in your area, but I don&#39;t have one. <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dtx/wxradio.php" target="_self">Details from National Weather Service Detroit</a> about the network of weather radios in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Weather facsimile</strong>. Again, never have managed to do this, but if you have the right radio you can decode faxes with weather maps on the that are broadcast over the air. Also known as WEFAX, the technology dates from the 1920s. Details if you are good at such things from <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/radiofax.htm">National Weather Service marine forecast services</a>.</p>
<p>You should be able to get real time notifications of severe weather even if you have no power, no cell tower, and no Internet; that&#39;s why you have batteries for your radio.</p>

Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson.  Written after Scott-Heron had recorded "I'm New Here" but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.

      </h3>
      <p>Lightning hit a brick chimney at Ann Arbor&#39;s Northside Elementary School on Wednesday at about 4:15 p.m., sending bricks flying 100 feet through the school pickup area. Fortunately, no one was hurt, as the area was vacant except for a staff member&#39;s vehicle which was damaged by flying brick.</p>
<p>I was aware of this when it happened because the lightning strike was powerful enough to cause the power grid to bounce, prompting <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/billmerrill/status/73488487357218817" target="_self">comments on Twitter and speculating on the exact location</a>.

      </h3>
      <p><p>The river is high. Will it flood? That&#39;s a very good question to ask in the morning before a storm; and the answer today turned out to be yes. Roads were inundated, Lake Barracuda emerged from its stormwater geyser, Depot Street filled with water, Mullholland Creek popped a manhole cover, and S. Main Street near Michigan Stadium filled. West Park&#39;s new water features get a workout.</p>
<p>Basements have taken on water, and the full extent of storm damage is unknown yet until we get the May 26 predicted rains.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for data, you&#39;ll find the specific current and recent historical information from these sources.</p>
<p>The USGS &#0160;<a href="http://water.usgs.gov/data/" target="_self">Water Data Discovery page</a> describes the <a href="http://water.usgs.gov" target="_self">National Water Information System</a>&#0160;which has reat time, predictive, and historical data for use.</p>
<p>USGS National Water Information System real-time water data for gauges in the area is measured every 15 minutes and reported with 60-90 minutes delay. Look at the gauges for the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mi/nwis/uv?site_no=04174500" target="_self">Huron River at Ann Arbor</a>, and you&#39;ll see a graph showing current levels. It&#39;s also possible to go back and get the data as data going back as far as 120 days, and to retrieve prior years data on a daily basis.&#0160;</p>
<p>There is also a gauge on Allen Creek which has collected data from some storms, but which is not in the National Water Information System and not always online. Allen Creek empties into the Huron River just downstream of Argo Dam, and at peak flow it can dump at least 1500 cubic feet per second into the river. I have seen data from one storm, and it looks like this can turn into 600 cubic feet per second at the next gauge, though that&#39;s only one data point.</p>
<p>You can look yourself at the tabular data for the <a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwisweb/data/exsa_rat/04174500.rdb">river rating of the Huron River at Wall Street</a>, which shows a level by level matching of flow vs water height. If the river is very low (300 cfs), then a sudden burst of 600 cfs will raise the level of the river by about a foot, and a burst of 1500 cfs will raise the level of the river by about two feet.</p>
<p>River forecasts come out routinely between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. and if needed a second forecast goes out between 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., according to National Weather Service meteorologist <strong>Danny Costello</strong>.&#0160;</p>
<p>For more media information about products provided by the NWS, here&#39;s a slide deck I found on the Grand Rapids NOAA site as a media briefing. It explains in one of the slides a key aspect of predictions: the weather service changes from &quot;watch&quot; to &quot;warning&quot; when a forecast probability goes up to 80% likelihood of the event occurring.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-24-a2dda-aacitycouncil-notice/">If you are interested in going to public meetings, you must be interested in advance</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The Michigan Open Meetings Act requires 18 hours advance notice of special meetings, and even less time (though I am not clear how much less time) for special meetings of committees. Thus, if you were not on a mailing list (with a relatively small number of people on the list), you did not receive notice directly of this meeting which is needed to resolve the <a href="http://a2gov.org" target="_self">City of Ann Arbor</a> and the <a href="http://a2dda.org" target="_self">Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority</a>&#39;s mutual disagreements over the city budget.</p>
<p>I follow this primarily through the exhaustively detailed reporting of my <a href="http://workantileexchange.com" target="_self">current coworking group</a> member <strong>Dave Askins</strong> at the <a href="http://annarborchroncile.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a>, the timely reporting of my former coworker <strong>Ryan Stanton</strong> at <a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/AnnArbor.com" target="_self">AnnArbor.com</a>, and the new news beat that my former coworker <strong>James Dickson</strong> is carving out at the <a href="http://a2journal.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor Journal</a>, and the editorial direction that home town friend <strong>John Hilton</strong>&#0160;directs at the monthly <a href="http://annarborobserver.com/" target="_self">Ann Arbor Observer</a>.</p>
<p>From time to time, the autonomous collective of <a href="http://www.damnarbor.com/" target="_self">Damn Arbor</a> pitches in, with <strong>Ben Connor Barrie</strong> most likely to be the townie and grad student voice of civic news gathering. That weblog is in the tradition of previous efforts, notably <strong>Rob Goodspeed</strong>&#39;s <a href="http://goodspeedupdate.com/20050716/Cat-AnnArbor.htm" target="_self">Goodspeed Update</a>, the autonomous collective and voice of <strong>Julie Weatherbee</strong> at&#0160;<a href="http://arborupdate.com" target="_self">Arbor Update</a>, and a long-anonymous <strong>Julia Lipman</strong> at&#0160;<a href="http://annarborisoverrated.com" target="_self">Ann Arbor is Overrated</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>This is all shorthand to say that I hope you are going to this meeting, if you care about it, and that if you care enough about it to want to know that it exists without me telling you about it you have to ask to be informed in advance.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-24-patch-local-news-aggregation-2011/">Local news powered by Patch: the state of local news aggregation in 2011</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Two years ago, the state of the art in local news aggregation was outside.in. That site aggregated postings about a specific geographical area and offered up a web based user interface to republish those links on your web site. Outside.in did not have its own staff of reporters, and its automated systems for newsgathering were (to be charitable) fallible, and thus it sometimes threw up junk of various kinds which was unpleasant to wade through.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, or more specifically March 2011, where AOL&#39;s <a href="http://www.patch.com" target="_self">Patch</a> buys outside.in, a deal <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/04/aol-outside-in/" target="_self">reported by Techcrunch</a> to be worth south of $10 million.&#0160;</p>
<p>Patch&#39;s world model is of a world full of part time news gatherers publishing local news about locations which are small towns. In the local area, there&#39;s a <a href="http://dexter.patch.com/" target="_self">Dexter Patch</a>, a <a href="http://saline-milan.patch.com/" target="_self">Saline/Milan Patch</a>, a <a href="http://plymouth-mi.patch.com/" target="_self">Plymouth Patch</a> but no Ann Arbor Patch and no Ypsilanti Patch. &#0160;How do you get full-scope news coverage for every zip code, then? By reworking your outside.in feed structure as &quot;Local news powered by Patch&quot;, and suddenly you can push links out to a network of systems that are happy to put local news on the local weather page and don&#39;t much care about the details except that there needs to be a plausible result for every single zip code.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>This DTE power outage map shows the storm paths through the area for the storms of May 23, 2011 pretty clearly. Note the track along Michigan Avenue and then heading a bit to the north via the Davison; you&#39;re looking for when individual purple dots turn to green, yellow, orange and then red.</p>

<p>The red dot on the map and the worst hit individual zone is in Westland, with over 4400 customers out in an area bounded by Wayne Road, Merriman Road, Cherry Hill Road and Michigan Avenue.
