        <p>It&#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.
The power outage maps I have been collecting started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

Short asynchronous private message. A Twitter direct message works nicely for this, as does an SMS message. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-noemail-alternatives/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown.

        <p>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&#0160;
The Twitter input box doesn&#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&#39;t pop for it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-09-my-great-weird-ideas-dont-fit-in-140-characters/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;ve written about Supermemo before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&#39;t overwhelm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-06-supermemo-spaced-repetition-and-structured-randomness/">&raquo;</a></p>

I envy those with enough status to completely exit electronic mail, but at the very least I expect that an occasional weekend could be email-free.

I took notes in a quadrille notebook   for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-a2b3-meeting-non-summary-june-2-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>
