            <p>I&#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s played.
First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including Walker Tracker, Steps, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-28-walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.
Some background for context.
The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-26-top-of-mind-vs-top-of-page/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at discardia.com. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.
For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-summer-2011-discardia-notes/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>After a rough winter, potholes are ubiquitous on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.
The technology to repair a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&#39;s Day at Rowe&#39;s in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.
The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-20-strawberry-season-2011-report/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&#39;s, ALS, etc.).
 One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a diversity of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-20-neurodiversity/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The City of Ann Arbor is on a steady path to install LED street lighting. Downtown&#39;s Main Street and the campus entrance along South State Street both have distinctive and highly visible LEDs to illuminate well-travelled corridors.
While it&#39;s clear the LED lights use less energy, it&#39;s not always obvious that they cost less to install and operate for the duration of their expected lifetime. The technology is moving fast enough that next year&#39;s model will top this year&#39;s for the foreseeable future. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-19-led-street-lighting-/">&raquo;</a></p>

Chicago: Chicago Breaking News puts the start of the problems at 7:15 p.m. Central (8:15 p.m. Eastern) and reports major problems at O&rsquo;Hare. A later update attributes the first official announcement of the problem as coming from the FAA, not from United.

            <p>It&#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.
The power outage maps I have been collecting started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &quot;dial by twitter name&quot; in the sense that there&#39;s no command line prompt that has a &quot;call&quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object.
