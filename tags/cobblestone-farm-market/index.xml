      <description>The following was posted to the Cobblestone Farm mailing list and is repeated here for your edification (and enjoyment of distinctive fruit).
Cobblestone Market has much to offer you and your family&amp;#0160;this Tuesday&amp;#0160;evening (4pm-7pm). Come try some new tastes, then warm your hands and feet by our fire pit!&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
There will be&amp;#0160;paw&amp;#0160;paws&amp;#0160;at the market&amp;#0160;tomorrow, thanks to Marc Boone and his volunteers! Paw&amp;#0160;paws&amp;#0160;are a native fruit which tastes a like a banana and mango combined.</description>
