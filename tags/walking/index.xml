      <title>Revisiting Walker Tracker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter months it&#39;s harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it&#39;s warm. That all said, there&#39;s no less need to be mindful of how much exercise you are getting when it&#39;s cold out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In days past, I was able to predict my mood rather accurately by checking how many steps I got on my pedometer. If the number was below 5000 you could count on me to be grouchy, and those rare days when the count exceeded 20000 were days when I couldn&#39;t concentrate on much of anything except moving. There&#39;s a seasonally adjusted optimum of approximately 10000 steps - minus a few in winter, plus a few in summer - that I think of as a target that if I happen to move that much in a day that everything else works out OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.walkertracker.com&#34;&gt;Walker Tracker&lt;/a&gt; on and off since 2006, or so the stats tell me, and in that time I&#39;ve logged over 7 million steps. Though the site interface has changed a little bit and my old crowd of fellow pedestrians has mostly moved on from the site, there are still a few familiar faces of people more industrious than I am in logging their activity. I&#39;m looking forward to revisiting it and being a bit more diligent about getting out and about in the winter time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self: buy new mittens, ideally ones that let me have at least one index finger free to work my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self 2: the battery is said to last 6 months, whether you use the system or not, so be prepared to change it on the summer solstice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking Around, a new urban walking game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&amp;#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&amp;#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://walkertracker.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Walker Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://swellnessresearch.wordpress.com/projects/steps/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Steps&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second - and here is what is novel, at least to me - is that there&amp;#39;s a bonus structure in the game designed to award bonuses for when you have accomplished tasks. The first bonus award that I&amp;#39;m awarding myself looks at constructing a walk so that you make an orbit around the biggest possible chunk of territory; that is to say, repeated walks along the same path will get you zero bonus, but going out of your way on a detour will add to your score, and trekking through unfamiliar territory in a big loop is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this is a pen and paper game and I haven&amp;#39;t fully worked out the point structure. I have a notion that you capture territory every time you orbit it, so that you might win a park by going all the way around it, and you might win a political ward or precinct by capturing a loop around it. To simplify greatly, since I am trying to keep record of this in a small book, I&amp;#39;m just drawing a graph with destinations rather than tracking every street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some idea sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/node/18868&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Riverwalks Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;is a book of walking loops along the Huron River, written by&amp;#0160;Brenda E. Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://laketrek.blogspot.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Lake Trek&lt;/a&gt; is the weblog for&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://laketrek.blogspot.com/search/label/Loreen%20Niewenhuis&#34; rel=&#34;tag&#34;&gt;Loreen Niewenhuis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;who wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brilliant-books.net/product/1000-mile-walk-beach&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;A 1000-Mile Walk on the Beach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;about her circumnavigation on foot of Lake Michigan. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m going to beat that top score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Graham wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/18/PKG7DG81961.DTL#ixzz0YAiHcOQj&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Walking The World&lt;/a&gt;, and his quest to walk every street in San Francisco, in 2005 for SF Gate; his web site is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfwalkingman.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;SF Walking Man&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://play.aadl.org/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;AADL Summer Reading Game&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;has points for reading books and badges for doing various other tasks, and the gamers there know how to make a game that will make you read. There should therefore be points in my Walking Around game every time you complete part of a circuit that connects to a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allcitynewyork.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;All City New York&lt;/a&gt; is the work of Moses Gates, whose game board includes the challenge of visiting all of the census tracts of New York City. Thanks to Ruth Kraut for the link.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tacoma, &lt;a href=&#34;http://xca2.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Brian Kerr&lt;/a&gt; is getting bonus points in his version of the game for elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now pardon me while I connect some dots in my game map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
