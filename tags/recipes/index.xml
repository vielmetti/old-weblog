      <title>Chicken and onion curry</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-chicken-and-onion-curry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry&#34;&gt;chicken and onion curry&lt;/a&gt;
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431&#34;&gt;daikon raita&lt;/a&gt; from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I am eating a sandwich, with a recipe in Github</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich.
That&amp;rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies,
even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative
of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need
only point you at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/main.html&#34;&gt;Usenet Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;,
developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.
&amp;ldquo;I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I would have feared.&amp;rdquo; But that collection is
weak on sandwiches, lending itself more to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/us/SP-menu.html&#34;&gt;soups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this need I have started a small and pitiful but
hopefully growable sandwich recipe collection, using Github
as the hosting place of choice. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich&#34;&gt;the vielmetti/sandwich repository&lt;/a&gt;
for the first start. As it happens, I am clearly not the only person
to think this way; herewith some collection of sandwich collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrie Turner (@bazbt3) came up with roughly the same idea at the same
time, and you might see his &lt;a href=&#34;http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2015/12/10/git-sandwiches/&#34;&gt;git sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; blog for the proper inspiration for collection
development. Thanks to @ellemef for connecting us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single sandwiches in git include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magnus919/grilledcheese&#34;&gt;grilled cheese&lt;/a&gt;, from Magnus Hedemark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcon/recipes/tree/master/meals/fried_chicken_sandwich&#34;&gt;gluten free fried chicken sandwich&lt;/a&gt; from Patrick Connelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and certainly many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ill-equipped in your kitchen
to make your own sandwiches, this command line tool will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js&#34;&gt;order you a sandwich from Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with a makefile so that you invoke it as
&lt;code&gt;sudo make me a sandwich&lt;/code&gt; and it will do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>food coop notes for July 18, 2015</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2015 14:23:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes over a cup of coffee and some cold roast chicken. I need
to mix up my menu selections at the coop more so that I can remember
what I was writing by what I ate; I usually eat the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain were here at the coop, doing
the NY Times crossword. (Saturday crossword in 36:05, a mid-day triumph.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market: cherries, parsley, kale, potatoes, dill, tomatoes.
The potatoes will be boiled and dressed with a dill vinaigrette.
(I had to look up the word vinaigrette.) The recipes I found add
green beans and boiled eggs to a salad with cold potatoes, using
a mustard vinaigrette with added chopped dill. The cherries will
probably just be eaten out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UP travel discussion included the obligatory discussion of insects,
including ticks (&amp;ldquo;like bedbugs, for the woods&amp;rdquo;) and horrible sand
flies that will swarm you and leave you screaming running from the
beach. There&amp;rsquo;s a good reason that the UP has miles of undeveloped beaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t mention bugs in the UP without remembering
&lt;a href=&#34;http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/&#34;&gt;The Backyard Arthropod Project&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;ldquo;A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI&amp;rdquo;,
by Tim Eisele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still hacking away at generating interesting reports from
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist&#34;&gt;stringdist&lt;/a&gt;
package from Mark van der Loo. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31486913/r-producing-a-list-of-near-matches-with-stringdist-and-stringdistmatrix&#34;&gt;R: producing a list of near matches with stringdist and stringdistmatrix&lt;/a&gt; and the answers provided
helped unearth the melt() function from the reshape2 library,
and with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you take a matrix and turn it into an edge list.
A little bit of filtering, and you get a report of near matches
in a list, enough for me to catch variant spellings of
vinagrette to vinaigrette in a &amp;ldquo;make test&amp;rdquo; step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow was fun for this task, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try it again.
The process of describing your problem in enough detail that someone
who knows the issue can add the one or two lines of code to make
it work is a useful exercise. It&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of a search
engine in many ways - of course I could find melt() once I know
its name, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the name you can&amp;rsquo;t find anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit of interestingness has to do with turning the dist
data structure returned by stringdist into a variety of useful
images. There&amp;rsquo;s a package that dumps out a &amp;ldquo;dendogram&amp;rdquo;, and if I&amp;rsquo;m
careful in formatting the data I think I can coerce R into producing
data that can be imported directly into the tools that
Valdis Krebs
has written for network exploration and visualization. The
promise within R is a &amp;ldquo;distgraph&amp;rdquo; that does the visualization,
but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet finding the cadre of experts who use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art on the walls is Julie Marron-Parker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sunburst&amp;rdquo;. She writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the sun shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Michigan (160 days of sun per year) I have come to
appreciate when the sun is out. This piece brings the energy of the
sun into the world, regardless of the weather outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Meloche writes about &lt;a href=&#34;http://tommeloche.com/the-doorway-effect/&#34;&gt;the doorway effect&lt;/a&gt;,
where going through a doorway wipes out your short term memory
to make way for new short term memories. It got me thinking
about the &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;memory palace&lt;/span&gt;, and how you might construct
in your mind a series of portals and doorways to walk through so
that you can remember a series of items in such a way that you
take advantage of the doorway effect to pull memories in and out
of your short term thinking. The technology is &amp;ldquo;mnemotechnics&amp;rdquo;,
that&amp;rsquo;s a good keyword to pull lots of interesting thinking
(which sometimes sounds like crazytalk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reminds me - I need to move to another room, so that I can
remember what I need to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some sweet potato cauliflower soup recipes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allyson Kramer likes hers with a bit of garam masala:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allysonkramer.com/2011/10/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&#34;&gt;http://www.allysonkramer.com/2011/10/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Three Peas wants carrots and celery and chicken stock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ourthreepeas.com/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&#34;&gt;http://ourthreepeas.com/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food.com and &amp;ldquo;Kelly in TO&amp;rdquo; calls for curry and cinnamon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/cauliflower-sweet-potato-curry-soup-246992&#34;&gt;http://www.food.com/recipe/cauliflower-sweet-potato-curry-soup-246992&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meal plan pairs this with biscuits and kale, and it was delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hoppin&#39; Giovanni (Rapini with white beans)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-02-hoppin-giovanni-rapini-with-white-beans/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 16:20:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-02-hoppin-giovanni-rapini-with-white-beans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This simple dish of beans and greens comes from Mary Ann Esposito&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ciaoitalia.com/seasons/season-2200/episode-2221/broccoli-rabe-with-white-beans&#34;&gt;Ciao Italia&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s similar in many ways to the traditional &#34;Hoppin&#39; John&#34; served for good luck for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hoppin&#39; Giovanni&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wash and chop a bunch of rapini (broccoli rabe). If you can&#39;t find rapini, some other mild green like turnip greens (or even kale) would work nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mince a shallot fine and saute in a large pan in olive oil until fragrant. Add a few generous pinches of red pepper flakes. Put the chopped rapini into the pan and cook until the greens are cooked through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drain and rinse a can of white beans (cannellini). When the greens are cooked through, add the beans and stir. You can add a little more olive oil to the pan at this point if you want to. Stir and then bring back up to heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve hot. This would go good with pasta.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>making fruit liqueurs, (or) how to prepare for the holidays well in advance</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2008 23:50:58 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s fruit season (or nearly so) and so it&#39;s time to start thinking about what we&#39;re going to do for making holiday gifts.  One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some minimal collection of things to help for this year, one fruit at a time; not exhaustive, but maybe it will help jump start next year.  Ordered in rough order of appearance of the fruit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberry liqueur.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cottagesmallholder.com/?p=750&#34;&gt;Irene&#39;s Strawberry liqueur&lt;/a&gt; from The Cottage Smallholder; noting that &#34;There’s nothing like the distraction of homemade grog when times are getting tough.&#34;
&lt;li&gt;Juneberry liqueur.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.farm-garden.com/viewtopic.php?id=1056&#34;&gt;Saskatoons go with gin&lt;/a&gt;, says contributor &#34;prairiemaid&#34; from Manitoba.
&lt;li&gt;Gooseberry liqueur.  In the 1930s, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/GuidesToCollections/MeltisofBedford.aspx&#34;&gt;Meltis of Bedford&lt;/a&gt; introduced a gooseberry liqueur sweet to the UK market which was a big success, so they say.    Read Anton Chekov&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html&#34;&gt;Gooseberries&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&#39;t have a recipe.
&lt;li&gt;Currants.  Make cassis; here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/labruscagrape/2005-June/000296.html&#34;&gt;cassis recipe&lt;/a&gt;, from &#34; The Cook and the Gardener&#34; by Amanda Hesser, A Year of Recipes and Writings from the French Countryside.
&lt;li&gt;Blueberries.  Freeze the berries first, then make &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guntheranderson.com/liqueurs/blueber0.htm&#34;&gt;blueberry liqueur.&lt;/a&gt;.  Ex-Michigander &lt;a href=&#34;http://culinariaeugenius.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/my-staples-summer-blueberry-liqueur/&#34;&gt;Culinaria Eugenius&lt;/a&gt; has a photo of the red-purple liquid that results.  
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2008 Michigan blueberry picking information</title>

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Dexter_Blueberry_Farm&#34;&gt;Dexter Blueberry Farm&lt;/a&gt; is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/07/dexter-blueberr.html&#34;&gt;Last year they charged $1.35 per pound for U-Pick&lt;/a&gt;, and it was easy to fill a five pound bucket in a single session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the Main Street Bridge through Dexter is closed to eastbound traffic, so if you are heading back to Ann Arbor you&#39;ll go around downtown Dexter.  See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.villageofdexter.org/&#34;&gt;Village of Dexter web site&lt;/a&gt; for details and a construction webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly farther away is &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/The_Blueberry_Patch&#34;&gt;The Blueberry Patch&lt;/a&gt; in Grass Lake, just east of Jackson.  The berries are organic, and they use nets to keep away the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part of the state where I know a bit of detail is in the southwestern corner (known as Michiana) near New Buffalo, MI, Michigan City IN and the surrounding area.  I scanned in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/1225078024/&#34;&gt;list of Michiana blueberry picking farms&lt;/a&gt; when we were there last year, and that info should still be good.  It&#39;s the closest Michigan berrypicking you&#39;ll get if you&#39;re coming from Chicagoland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leduc Blueberries near Kalamazoo has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leducblueberries.com/extra.iml&#34;&gt;a collection of eight years worth of annual blueberry recipes&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), which include the usual bakes, crumbles, pies and the like plus a series of dinner salads like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&amp;controller=article&amp;category_id=157&amp;article=18460&#34;&gt;blueberry lemon chicken salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other blueberry crop news:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report from Hammonton, New Jersey predicts an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thehammontonnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/LIFESTYLE/806250307/1024/NEWS17&#34;&gt;average New Jersey blueberry crop for 2008&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#34;The hot weather that we&#39;ve been having has had some effects on the ripening and harvesting of our products, though the cooler-than-normal ground temperatures and, until recently, cool overnight temperatures have helped to somewhat mitigate the day heat,&#34; said William Walker of the New Jersey Department Agriculture&#39;s Jersey Fresh program. &#34;The season was slow to begin, but we&#39;re now on a normal production schedule.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeGrandchamp Farms predicts a good 2008 season:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I write this article, the 2008 blueberry crop looks like it has the potential to be an excellent one. I believe a lot has to do with the excellent growing season last summer which produced good growth and bud set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wholesale prices for the fresh market were strong last year and should continue for the 2008 season. Demand for blueberries is strong for the processing market as more manufacturers are using blueberries in their product lines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/CropValuSu/CropValuSu-02-14-2008.txt&#34;&gt;USDA crop price report&lt;/a&gt; for the last three years for blueberries:&lt;br/&gt;
2005: $1.44/lb&lt;br /&gt;
2006: $1.76/lb        &lt;br /&gt;
2007: $1.83/lb &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/ready-to-pick-michigan-blueberries/&#34;&gt;Absolute Michigan has a Ready To Pick feature on blueberries&lt;/a&gt; with recipes and crop and grower info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&#39;m looking for in comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you gone blueberry picking recently, and how was it?&lt;br /&gt;
Where do you go wild (not cultivated) berry picking - if not precisely where, then at least the township?&lt;br /&gt;
What do you know about mechanical blueberry harvesters?&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever used a blueberry rake, and is it easy to make one out of ordinary materials by hand?&lt;br /&gt;
What are your favorite blueberry recipes?&lt;br /&gt;
How do you preserve blueberries for February in Michigan when it&#39;s gray all the time?&lt;br /&gt;
What varieties of blueberry are good for growing in your yard, and what soil do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2008 urban berry foraging report part 1: Juneberries in Ann Arbor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year around this time (June 17) the juneberry trees in the streets of Ann Arbor are ripe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you&#39;re from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy.  They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you&#39;re walking down the street.   If you have lots and lots of these berries (also called saskatoons), you can make a pie out of them - make a two crust pie, with a filling of 3.5 cups juneberries to 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 Tbs of flour.    Here&#39;s a video from &lt;a href=&#34;http://wildfoodplants.com/article/113/aunt-marilyns-juneberry-pie&#34;&gt;Wild Food Plants&lt;/a&gt; about Aunt Marilyn&#39;s Juneberry Pie.  You can also dry them and use them like dried blueberries - if you get any of them home, or you can pound them with buffalo meat (from your favorite local supplier of buffalo meat) and make pemmican.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you have surplus juneberries *and* surplus grasshoppers, and a taste for them both, there&#39;s a traditional Utah Indian recipe for &#34;grasshopper fruitcake&#34;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Edwin Bryant15 (circa 1848) provided one of the few assessments of grasshopper palatability by a white. following an encounter with Utah Indians, an occasion when three women appeared, &#34;bringing baskets containing a substance, which, upon examination, we ascertained to be service-berries, crushed to a jam and mixed with pulverized grasshoppers. This composition being dried in the sun until it becomes hard, is what may be called the &#39;fruitcake&#39; of these poor children of the desert. No doubt these women regarded it as one of the most acceptable offerings they could make to us. We purchased all they brought with them, paying them in darning needles and other small articles, with which they were much pleased. The prejudice against the grasshopper &#39;fruitcake&#39; was strong at first, but it soon wore off, and none of the delicacy was thrown away or lost .... After being killed, they [the grasshoppers] are baked before the fire or dried in the sun, and then pulverized between smooth stones. Prejudice aside, I have tasted what are called delicacies, less agree able to the palate.&#34; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hollowtop.com/finl_html/amerindians.htm&#34;&gt;The Food Insects Newsletter: Some Insect Foods of the American Indians: And How the Early Whites Reacted to Them November 1994. Volume 7, Issue #3.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to juneberry picking in Ann Arbor is to know that you can have a big pile of delicious berries simply by walking across town in such a way that you hit a series of trees in order, no need to backtrack.  Here&#39;s the juneberry tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Zingerman&#39;s&#34;&gt;Zingerman&#39;s Deli&lt;/a&gt; on Detroit St.  If you can&#39;t find it, ask a native, they&#39;ll be glad to direct you there, they&#39;re used to it.  The juneberry trees are around the side on Kingsley St.  Stop inside, ask if they have any &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zingermans.com/Search.aspx?kw=juneberry&#34;&gt;juneberry jam&lt;/a&gt; for sale, furrow your brow disappointedly if they don&#39;t, taste something else thoughfully, then head out the front and pick more from a tree on Detroit St.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep heading up Detroit St and cross over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Farmers_Market&#34;&gt;Farmer&#39;s Market&lt;/a&gt;, open Weds. and Sat.  Look around the stalls, ask the farmers nicely if their juneberry crop is good this year, furrow your brow when they say they won&#39;t have any at market, admire the solar panels, pick up from spinach from Shannon, and then walk towards the Ann Arbor Observer on Catherine St.  You&#39;ll find more berries on the side of that building, they are a bit shaded so they ripen later.  Pick a small box full, head back to market, put a price tag on it, sell it - PROFIT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross back toward Fifth Avenue, head over Huron St and towards the Bank of Ann Arbor.  With your newfound gains make a deposit, but only after you do your harvest from the trees in front of the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep heading south on Fifth heading towards the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor District Library&lt;/a&gt;, but stop before you get there at the Library Lot parking lot and admire the prolific trees there.  Consider whether the &lt;A href=&#34;http://arborupdate.com/article/1660/downtown-library-project-discussion&#34;&gt;downtown library project&lt;/a&gt; plans for that surface lot which call for a structure to be built on that lot preserve the fruiting trees which are so characteristic of historical Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head into the library, and start figuring out how you are going to preserve those berries for the winter.  Check the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/sopac/tag/juneberry&#34;&gt;juneberry&lt;/a&gt; tag in the catalog; if you don&#39;t find anything, go to the MEL inter-library loan, &lt;a href=&#34;http://elibrary.mel.org/search/X?%28juneberry%29&amp;Da=&amp;Db=&amp;SORT=D&amp;backlink=http://www.aadl.org/cat/seek/search/X?(juneberry)&amp;Da=&amp;Db=&amp;SORT=D&amp;topformsub=1&#34;&gt;search for Juneberry&lt;/a&gt;, and end up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Juneberry-tree-French-writers-Canada/dp/0887721583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213754418&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Jacque Ferron&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; &#34;The Juneberry Tree&#34;.  Sit and eat your berries until it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
