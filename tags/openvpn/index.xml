      <description>Coffee and wifi (double espresso over ice) at the &amp;ldquo;dog park Biggby&amp;rdquo;, Platt Road at Ellsworth. It&amp;rsquo;s not an inconvenient location, and the very large south-facing windows are good to know about as the days get shorter.
More than 90 degrees outside, and I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to make dinner. The recipe is for &amp;ldquo;broccoli Calabrian style&amp;rdquo; from Martha Rose Shulman. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find that exact recipe online, but this Bucatini Con Broccoli Alla Calabrese is close.</description>

      <description>The task at hand is simple. Whenever a particular airplane is visible overhead, send out a tweet with that notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself with this announcement more than twice an hour, but try not to have too much lag in reporting.
The full stack of hardware and software to do this is not particularly complicated to use once you get it all running, but there are a series of issues and observations along the way that add to the complexity.</description>

      <description>Previously: OpenVPN in a container
Also previously: Split tunnels considered harmful
I have this running in a staging environment and a test environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that it runs on a single host &amp;amp; thus provides neither high availability in the case of Amazon funkiness nor scalability to handle lots of clients.</description>

      <description>A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container.
I&amp;rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; branch.
Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task, with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&amp;rsquo;s docker-openvpn is what I&amp;rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from jpetazzo/dockvpn which solves the same problem slightly differently.
There&amp;rsquo;s a tutorial on Digital Ocean that describes the setup including client-side support.</description>
