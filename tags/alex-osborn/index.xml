      <description>&lt;p&gt;Merlin Mann has relaunched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34;&gt;43 Folders&lt;/a&gt;; he doesn&#39;t want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish.&amp;nbsp; (Or something like that; it probably overstates the issue.)&amp;nbsp; And he bemoans the tendency of people to consume an endless stream of shitty first drafts as if that was the only thing worth doing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of
fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.
I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of
it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.&amp;nbsp; (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better&#34;&gt;better)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this post itself is a shitty first draft of a summary of what is probably 100 other things I&#39;ve thought about, I&#39;ll keep it short.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, when you want to have deep insight into a topic, you have to immerse yourself in the details.&amp;nbsp; Your makebelieve insight and fake-connectedness are exercises in helping you understand the world, and even though sometimes the explanation that comes up doesn&#39;t really sound any more insightful than what your wikipedia-quoting eight year old can come up with, it came from you.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, if you are really lucky, you get to reflect on a bunch of first drafts and turn them into second and third drafts - hurray!&amp;nbsp; But at least you got that thinking out into public in a format that can get some feedback.&amp;nbsp; The best way to have one good idea is to have a thousand ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
