      <description>Gogs is a self-hosted Git server, an alternative to using Github as a for-pay hosted service or Gitlab as another self-hosted system. It&#39;s written in the Go language, and is said to be sparing of system resources.

I&#39;m building it using Docker on a Raspberry Pi 2, thanks to the folks at Hypriot; the writeup is Run your own GitHub-like service with the help of Docker, and the file on Dockerhub is at hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian.</description>

      <description>Merlin Mann has relaunched 43 Folders; he doesn&#39;t want to be the productivity guy any more, he wants to be the creativity guy.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a good choice.
He notes some essential tension between the demand of professional bloggers to produce immense quantities of on-topic dreck that generates a lot of page views, vs the wise craft of intense creative types who sweat the details to edit things down to a fine polish.</description>
