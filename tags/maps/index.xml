      <description>This map from the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma (via Atlantic Cities) shows the destructive path of the Moore, Oklahoma tornado of 20 May 2013. This is a preliminary map that also shows the track of a 3 May 1999 tornado that followed a very similar path.
 
There&amp;#39;s too much graphic, devastating imagery from the scene which I won&amp;#39;t include here. Dr Jeff Masters has an excellent overview of the meteorology of the event, including accounts of debris being thrown 100 miles in the air to land on Tulsa, Oklahoma.</description>

      <description>The LROC (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera) orbits the moon, taking high resolution photos and beaming back data for analysis. This photo shows relief of the far side (the &#34;dark side&#34;) of the moon, with false color indicating terrain.

      <description>ANN ARBOR, May 7, 2015: Power outage maps for those utility companies that provide it are listed here by state, alphabetically. As of November 2, 2014, 45 of 50 states have something here.
The list is known to be incomplete, but the list from Wikipedia (outage management system) is also incomplete. To be overly comprehensive, if there are screen captures that I can gather, I will; they will not be current when you look at them, but I will time and date stamp them as best I can.</description>

      <description>Google search: black river falls michigan fire map
Twitter search: black river falls
As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there&#39;s a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.
When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.</description>
