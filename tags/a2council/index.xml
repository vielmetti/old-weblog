      <title>Daily coffee and wifi, September 7, 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coffee and wifi (double espresso over ice) at the Peoples Food Coop,
on North Fourth Ave. The lunch hot bar here is very good
and the place is busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was Ann Arbor City Council, a marathon session that
resulted in grudging approval of site plans for hundreds of new homes
and apartments over the opposition of neighbors in adjacent
neighborhoods. Woodbury Club Apartments will be on the northeast
side of town near Nixon Road and M-14, and South Pond Village
will be tucked away off Chalmers behind Arborland but not connected
to it. In both cases the votes reflected the split between the
Council Party who saw the &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; vote as obligatory to avoid a
lawsuit, and the Anti Party who had few enough votes to be
able to vote &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; as a protest vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apple keynote is today, awaiting news about new shiny toys
to see how much less the old shiny toys are worth.
Apparently the new Apple watch will have Pokemon Go on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I took notes at the coop was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/&#34;&gt;July 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when
I took note of Tom Meloche&amp;rsquo;s post on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://tommeloche.com/the-doorway-effect/&#34;&gt;the doorway effect&lt;/a&gt;,
and how our short term memory gets dumped when we cross
a threshold. &lt;a href=&#34;https://al.nd.edu/news/latest-news/27483-walking-through-doorways-causes-forgetting-new-research-shows/&#34;&gt;Gabriel Radvansky&lt;/a&gt;
from Notre Dame is the scientist that Tom remembers.
The effect apparently is that going through a door
starts a new memory event, and to prepare for that
new event and give us a fresh landscape for thinking
the short term memory we had been holding gets emptied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an active imagination you can think of yourself
moving through doors without ever really changing your
place of sitting. My guess is that not only do you have
your current thinking flushed when you leave a room, but
the new room (if it&amp;rsquo;s familiar) pre-loads some thoughts.
Construct your mental landscape appropriately and you
end up with the memory palace which you can walk through
effortlessly in your mind, remembering its details everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily coffee and wifi, September 6, 2016</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-09-06-daily-coffee/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coffee and wifi (double espresso over ice) at the &amp;ldquo;dog park Biggby&amp;rdquo;,
Platt Road at Ellsworth. It&amp;rsquo;s not an inconvenient location,
and the very large south-facing windows are good to know about
as the days get shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 90 degrees outside, and I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to make dinner.
The recipe is for &amp;ldquo;broccoli Calabrian style&amp;rdquo; from Martha Rose Shulman.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find that exact recipe online, but this
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.italycookingschools.com/bucatini-con-broccoli-alla-calabresebucatini-broccoli-calabrian-style/&#34;&gt;Bucatini Con Broccoli Alla Calabrese&lt;/a&gt; is close.
Substitute sunflower seeds for pine nuts.
The key to it is that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to cook anything too long,
because it&amp;rsquo;s hot out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First day of the 2016 school year for the boys. S. is at Community High School,
and J. had his first day at Tappan Middle School. I don&amp;rsquo;t write
about them much, but it sounded like today was a good day all in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two new front tires for the car - one of them was quite flat, and they
were both quite worn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new venue for lunch, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sessionrooma2.com/&#34;&gt;Session Room&lt;/a&gt; on Jackson Road in Scio Township.
They have a very long list of beers which you can conveniently order
in very small glasses (4 oz) to try out and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current challenge is to get an instance of Salt running in a
Docker container, integrated with OpenVPN a la this
&lt;a href=&#34;https://garthwaite.org/virtually-secure-with-openvpn-pillars-and-salt.html&#34;&gt;OpenVPN provisioning with Salt&lt;/a&gt; recipe. We currently think that the
best way to manage this is to connect it to the Docker
container via an &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-file-system-shared-file-storage-for-amazon-ec2/&#34;&gt;Elastic File System&lt;/a&gt; mount.
A sub-challenge is finding the right way to run Salt in a container;
tooling for this is awkward because you really to run some commands
within the context of the container. Soon&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thisissoon/Docker-Salt-Master&#34;&gt;Docker Salt Master&lt;/a&gt; looks like a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Ann Arbor City Council. Follow along on the #&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/a2council&#34;&gt;a2council&lt;/a&gt; hashtag on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
