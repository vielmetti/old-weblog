      <description>The task at hand is simple. Whenever a particular airplane is visible overhead, send out a tweet with that notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself with this announcement more than twice an hour, but try not to have too much lag in reporting.
The full stack of hardware and software to do this is not particularly complicated to use once you get it all running, but there are a series of issues and observations along the way that add to the complexity.</description>

      <description>In March 2015 I wrote briefly about plane spotting with dump1090. In short, many airplanes have ADS-B transponders which squawk out their location, airspeed, and current conditions, and you can pick up those transmissions using an inexpensive RTL-SDR tuner stick and a simple antenna.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into this again to see if I can get a better understanding of how it works as well as to take advantage of a year plus of software development.</description>
