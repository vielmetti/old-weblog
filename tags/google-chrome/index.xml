      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m testing out using Opera instead of Chrome as my browser of choice, as recommended by Ernie Smith.  So far so good.
He notes that Opera is &amp;ldquo;basically Chrome (same engine) minus the battery drain&amp;rdquo;.
My experience to date bears that out, though it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stages yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is that memory usage for Opera is way less than for Chrome.
That&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me because I&amp;rsquo;m often noticing that this MacBook Air is in the red zone for memory with Chrome.
With Opera that&amp;rsquo;s not the case so far - memory has been green since starting.
This should also translate into less SSD disk activity for swapping, and better battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default configuration includes a lot of interesting features, including an ad blocker and a VPN.
Both of those are interesting, but not a complete replacement for the tools I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ad blocker is speedy, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t block the comments on MLive, which is a pity - Ghostery did that well.
Fortunately, Ghostery is supported on Opera, so I can have two ad blockers running at once to get the desired result.
Opera counts the number of ads blocked. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if Ghostery&amp;rsquo;s blocked ads are double-counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPN is set up to work with a public VPN endpoint, but I can&amp;rsquo;t configure it to use my private endpoint.
There are a number of other VPN plugins (plugsin?) available, each connecting to their own set of endpoints.
I&amp;rsquo;d like a general-purpose VPN tool that allows me to run my own endpoint, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found one yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t import all of my bookmarks and cookies and passwords, which is a attempt to stay away from Facebook.
Ask me how much time I spend (or waste) on Facebook! There must be a better use of your time than that.
