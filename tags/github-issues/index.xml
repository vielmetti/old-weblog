      <description>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.
The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&amp;rsquo;re likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were trying to do in the first place.</description>
