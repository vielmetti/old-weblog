      <description>Amazon Web Services had downtime yesterday. Their S3 storage service had what was described as elevated error rates in the US-East zone, and as a result failures started in other AWS services in US-East that depended on S3.
The failures were reminiscent of the DynamoDB downtime of September 20, 2015, in that seemingly unrelated services share a common failure mode because of unforeseen interdependencies.
 A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didnâ€™t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.</description>
