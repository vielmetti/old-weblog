      <description>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)
This week&amp;#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college.</description>
