      <description>This list of Skywarn nets is compiled from a list of Skywarn Twitter feeds and Broadcastify radio feeds. Networks are added when there is confirmed traffic. KE4KMD maintains a similar list, which was used in part to develop this one. There is a national Skywarn directory at Skywarn.org.
This list is sorted by state, and from there grouped regionally by National Weather Service forecast office directory. In some cases, NWS forecast areas cross state boundaries, and those are noted.</description>
