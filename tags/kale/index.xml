      <title>Chicken and onion curry</title>

      <description>Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a chicken and onion curry from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious, and worth repeating.
We had the meal with rice, kale, and a daikon raita from food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit with the rest of the table.
The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again, and how many weeks before we have it again?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Learn this one weird trick&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&amp;rdquo;
Really though it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&amp;rsquo;s had a sale on kale for 99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it from the wrong bin, whatever.
Get home, cook the kale (it&amp;rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually organic, and that I was overcharged.</description>

      <description>Dinner: roasted red peppers, roasted green beans, boiled potatoes, cool and crunchy red pepper and yellow tomato salad with balsamic, kale, and either eggs or bratwurst depending on your preferences. I really prefer cooking in the summertime!

      <description>At Ann Arbor Farmers Market:
Red Haven peaches üçë, potatoes üç†, kale, green onions, tomatoes, red peppers, and a cherry snow cone for my shopping companion.
(Testing to see how the emoji comes out; I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a kale emoji.)</description>

      <description>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&amp;#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&amp;#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!
Ingredients:
 oil for frying garlic 1 bag kale corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better green onions - chopped soy sauce  Method:</description>
