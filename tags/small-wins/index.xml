      <description>I am reminded again of Karl Weick&amp;rsquo;s work on &amp;ldquo;small wins&amp;rdquo;, the observation that large problems are so large that we are overwhelmed just in thinking about them. It can be incredibly powerful to have a series of small wins that provide some momentum and that set you up for increasing confidence and capability to tackle bigger issues.
My small win of the moment is getting this blog post up, reminding myself that once upon a time I met a writing deadline every day for publication, and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for every single post to be a big thing.</description>
