      <description>The task at hand is simple. Whenever a particular airplane is visible overhead, send out a tweet with that notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself with this announcement more than twice an hour, but try not to have too much lag in reporting.
The full stack of hardware and software to do this is not particularly complicated to use once you get it all running, but there are a series of issues and observations along the way that add to the complexity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working through the details of an upgrade from Mavericks to El Capitan. Some running notes.
The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster than my home UVerse.
After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is brew update. You would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed, and that brew is working hard to update everything.</description>
