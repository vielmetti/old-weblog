      <title>Ann Arbor area APRS network status, January 2016</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-14-aprs-network-status/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;APRS is the &amp;ldquo;Automatic Position Reporting Service&amp;rdquo;, a
system for sharing information about the position of
participating amateur radio stations. Clients transmit
position reports on 144.39 Mhz; digipeaters repeat
these reports to other monitoring stations; and various
IGate sites monitor transmissions and send their findings
to &lt;a href=&#34;http://aprs.fi&#34;&gt;aprs.fi&lt;/a&gt; which collects worldwide data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent memory there has been an APRS digipeater in
Chelsea, Michigan with wide area coverage, good enough
to pick up travellers on I-94 west of Ann Arbor.
The Chelsea digirepeater is currently off the air,
which leaves a coverage gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one station within the city of Ann Arbor.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://aprs.fi/info/a/KD8TDF&#34;&gt;KD8TDF&lt;/a&gt; is in southeast
Ann Arbor (EN82dg). Its coverage is enough to pick up
part of I-94 right adjacent to town. A second station,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://aprs.fi/info/a/AB3DC-1&#34;&gt;AB3DC-1&lt;/a&gt; is the
Ann Arbor/Ypsi Rx-iGate, w8pgw.org, right near St.
Joe&amp;rsquo;s Hospital (EN82eg).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion at last night&amp;rsquo;s ARROW meeting included a
desire to experiment on 2 meters with digital modes.
Dave New &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qrz.com/DB/N8SBE&#34;&gt;N8SBE&lt;/a&gt; talked
about software defined radio and GNU Radio, and demonstrated
monitoring car key-fobs on UHF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APRS is a very old and useful digital mode, and I
am hopeful that local network conditions will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CubicSDR, a cross-platform software defined radio</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 17:10:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CubicSDR is a software defined radio system for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
It&amp;rsquo;s at version 0.1.4-beta as of August 28, 2015, and you can download
the binaries from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4&lt;/a&gt; or
the source code from Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point of comparison for software defined radio is GQRX. When you put
CubicSDR on the screen it has a very pretty waterfall display and relatively
easy to sort out mouse commands, but it&amp;rsquo;s lacking some of the fancier
controls that a more mature program like GQRX has accumulated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting direction that CubicSDR is heading in is the product
roadmap that is on its home page - in particular, importing and using
digital modes that the liquid-dsp package supports, and additional
visualization tools that would make a pretty display even prettier.
The roadmap easily has a couple of years of development work, so there&amp;rsquo;s
lots to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CubicSDR supports the RTL-SDR dongles like my NooElec NESDR Mini 2,
and it&amp;rsquo;s free-as-in-GPL, so it&amp;rsquo;s very much worthwhile to give it a
download and see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>sudo port upgrade outdated</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac
under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading
binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software
that&amp;rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully
noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means
that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the
stack until the software you had been using stops working. The easiest
solution is to pull the freshest of the fresh versions, with all
dependencies suitably upgraded as well, so that you can at least
get to par with the latest. Only then can you sort through debug
information and know that if you report a bug it can be repeated
by people who are running current code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Macports this is two commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warning of course is that the second of these two commands
can take a very, very long time, as new software is downloaded
and compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is done! About 12 hours later, I again have a copy of
&lt;code&gt;gqrx&lt;/code&gt; that works, in particular the one that says that it is
&lt;code&gt;Gqrx software defined radio receiver 20151017&lt;/code&gt;. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have waited months to do the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listening to Radio Havana Cuba via a shortwave software defined radio</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-24-radio-havana-cuba/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2015 22:45:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-24-radio-havana-cuba/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Radio Havana Cuba via a shortwave listening post set up
with a software defined radio. The system, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blerp2.dyndns.org:8901/&#34;&gt;Great Lakes Listening Post&lt;/a&gt;,
has four separate radios covering the 80, 40, 30, and 20 meter bands, all
fed into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.websdr.org&#34;&gt;WebSDR&lt;/a&gt; software from PA3FWM. It&amp;rsquo;s
located in Michigan, and thus approximates the radio reception I&amp;rsquo;d get from
my own receiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R Havana Cuba is a good station to listen to. There&amp;rsquo;s interesting political
commentary, fun music, and the occasional show about shortwave listening.
The signal is usually strong and the frequency (6000 kHz) is easy to remember.
Most international braodcasters have refocused their attention on Internet
based broadcasts, but R Havana Cuba continues on with its shortwave service.
My Sony ICF-2010 set from the 1980s still has a Cold War era present to that
frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage to web-based software radio is the ability to pick up
stations from listening posts around the world. The WebSDR platform has stations
with good antennas around the world, and they each allow multiple listeners
to tune in to different stations without any of them monopolizing the receiver.
Most web-based SDR systems focus on shortwave and HF amateur bands, but every
so often you find a system that can tune domestic medium wave (AM) and
long wave bands, which gives you a chance to hear programs that were
never anticipated to be listened to from half way around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a dipole antenna for your SDR tuner stick from an old set of headphones</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-building-a-dipole-antenna-for-your-sdr-tuner-stick-from-an-old-set-of-headphones/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-building-a-dipole-antenna-for-your-sdr-tuner-stick-from-an-old-set-of-headphones/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes before I try to do the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). Some sort of adapter jack (or alligator clips) should be all I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can test the antenna on my Nokia 635 which has an FM tuner connected with the headphone jack as the antenna, and the ideal situation will be to have an antenna that I can just plug either into my phone or into my SDR tuner interchangeably. Once I figure all that out, the next next step is to make these antenna inputs for other radios. One step at a time though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be working from the tutorial &lt;a href=&#34;http://willus.com/author/antenna.shtml&#34;&gt;Making a Dipole FM Antenna&lt;/a&gt; on willus.com .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 490px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 11.35.53 AM&#34; title=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 11.35.53 AM&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c76ed742970b-500wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. Same form factor, bright blue in color, and the supplied antenna is a retractable whip with a magnetic base. As always it comes with no documentation and no software (you are expected to provide those).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously used a version of &#34;gqrx&#34; as a radio receiver, in a package that had been built for the Mac. This time I thought I&#39;d build from source. I went to the &#39;homebrew&#39; port system and found a version that said it worked for OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), but I&#39;m on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and the build didn&#39;t work (it crapped out in building scipy). Reading the documentation more closely the distribution says it&#39;s available through Macports, so I installed that and did &#34;sudo port install gnuradio&#34; and &#34;sudo port install gqrx&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macports is one of those amazing feats of modern software engineering where someone (or really a lot of people) have carefully and meticulously figured out how to take a package of source code and make it build, including tracing all of the dependencies upon which everything else needs to be built. For gqrx and GNU Radio this means (at the very bottom) that I had to have a working FORTRAN compiler so that I could compile the FORTRAN code hiding in the numerical analysis libraries. This brings me right back to the 1970s learning FORTRAN at Michigan Tech in their Summer Youth Program. I can&#39;t even imagine how old the code was that I compiled but it might actually date from then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything did build just fine, and then I had a radio. The first test is always to tune into WCBN, which came in with a strong signal, and to key up my ham radio transmitter via Echolink to make the W8UM repeater make some noise, and to get some weather radio going. Everything I tried worked just fine and passed with flying colors, the gqrx software is more modern than it once was in a couple of very helpful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was to grab one of the many versions of &#34;dump1090&#34; which uses the SDR radio to tune to aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that give you a version of aircraft radar. This also worked well, perhaps better than I could have expected. From home with an antenna in the middle of the house I could hear airplanes just north of Jackson, MI from Ann Arbor, MI (about 40 miles). I relocated to a cafe near the dog park (Ellsworth at Platt) that has a good view of the southern sky, and the same little bitty antenna pulled in reception from airplanes near Fort Wayne, IN (about 120 miles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s always more to try, of course. GNU Radio is a full toolkit for building your own radio design, complete with FM decoders and the like, and it has a fairly simple to understand user interface compared to how complex the underpinnings are (remember, FORTRAN). There&#39;s lots more software that uses the RTL-SDR libraries and even a port to the Raspberry Pi which I&#39;d like to try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>decoding radio digital modes without a radio, using WebSDR and fldigi</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-09-decoding-radio-digital-modes-without-a-radio-using-websdr-and-fldigi/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-09-decoding-radio-digital-modes-without-a-radio-using-websdr-and-fldigi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Fldigi-HB9ERN&#34; title=&#34;Fldigi-HB9ERN&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&#34;&gt;WebSDR&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&#34;&gt;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&lt;/a&gt; . This is a software-defined radio tuning  to the radio airwaves at the University of Twente in the Netherlands; it runs in your browser. There are 87 of these systems running around the world, listed at &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.org/&#34;&gt;websdr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&#34;&gt;fldigi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&#34;&gt;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&lt;/a&gt; . This software for Windows, Linux and OS X, runs on your local system and takes an audio signal and decodes it in one of many digital modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&#34;&gt;Soundflower&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&#34;&gt;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&lt;/a&gt; . This is a Mac system extension that allows you to redirect the audio output of one program (e.g. your browser) into the audio input of another program (e.g. fldigi). Not strictly necessary because the fldigi can also just decode whatever it hears through the computer&amp;rsquo;s built in microphone. I picked up the recommendation from an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hamradioandvision.com/websdr-digital-modes/&#34;&gt;HamRadioAndVision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of people have done Youtube videos describing what they are doing to make this work. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/component/content/article/63-sdr/290-fun-with-websdr-and-fldigi&#34;&gt;OZ9AEC&lt;/a&gt; has a 6 minute Youtube from 2009 shows reception in single channel and multichannel mode. He doesn&#39;t use Soundflower, just the built in mic of his Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not described here - and probably what I need to figure out next - are two key bits of information. Where do you tune to pick up digital signals? And, more importantly, which decoder do you use? It&#39;s not hard to pick out which modulation is being used if you have some practice, but as of this writing I couldn&#39;t readily tell you what WEFAX sounds like compared to RTTY. Still sorting through those details before I can claim to have mastered this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that this should work with a local software-defined radio as well, or even with a &#34;hardware-defined radio&#34; placed near your mic or patched in with a mic cable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What the W8UM net looks like in software defined radio</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-02-what-the-w8um-net-looks-like-in-software-defined-radio/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sample screen grab from tonight&amp;#39;s W8UM net on 145.23. Please note that the radio I&amp;#39;m using looks like it&amp;#39;s out of tune a little bit, since I&amp;#39;m actually listening here on 145.217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started looking into software defined radio for Mac OS X. The goal is to take a cheap USB stick, plug it in to the Mac, and have it connect to software that will decode radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far there&amp;#39;s nothing obvious that&amp;#39;s packaged as a single collection of software plus hardware, but that&amp;#39;s not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best notes to date are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://pinboard.in/t:sdr&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Pinboard&amp;#39;s t:sdr tag&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like it has a few dozen people sharing links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll update this when I get more working details.&lt;/p&gt;
