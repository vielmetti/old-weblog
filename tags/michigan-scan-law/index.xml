      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn this one weird trick&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&amp;rsquo;s had a sale on kale for
99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and
when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it
from the wrong bin, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get home, cook the kale (it&amp;rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the
twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&amp;rsquo;t
actually organic, and that I was overcharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been through the &amp;ldquo;Lucky&amp;rsquo;s overcharges&amp;rdquo; before on our neighborhood
email list, where it comes up from time to time., I didn&amp;rsquo;t
have to quote chapter and verse of state law, just mention the
Michigan scan law. The manager hand wrote a receipt and gave me
$5.00 cash as well as refunding the purchase price of the kale on
my card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any more kale. Chocolate ice cream
was $4.99 per half gallon, and it too was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your receipts, at least until the meal is eaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the twist-ties on your produce to make sure you got what you were charged for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic produce PLU numbers are 5 digits starting with a 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucky&amp;rsquo;s was friendly when I pointed out their error, no hassle at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sauteed kale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bunch kale (organic preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 clove garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat the oil until it shimmers. Slice the garlic into slices and
cook until fragrant but not yet browned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wash the kale and trim the stems . Chop the leaves finely. Add to
hot pan and stir until the kale has wilted somewhat and has changed
color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cup of water to the pan, then cover quickly. Steam
the kale until cooked to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
