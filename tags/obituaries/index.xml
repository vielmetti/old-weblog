      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music responded by playing his hits - &amp;ldquo;Little Red Corvette&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raspberry Beret&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Purple Rain&amp;rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find. Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.</description>
