As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there&#39;s a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.
When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.</description>
