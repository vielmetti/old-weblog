      <title>Daily Coffee and Wifi, Roos Roast Wednesday edition</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-22-daily-coffee-wifi-roos-roast/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Roos, an espresso over ice with a little half and half and a hard
boiled egg. It&amp;rsquo;s a very compact breakfast. The espresso is served in
an appropriately sized glass mug and tastes like the strongest little
iced latte you will ever have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my Mac, run &amp;lsquo;boot2docker upgrade&amp;rsquo;. That gets me up to current 1.7.1
revision of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Edwards-MacBook-Air:~ emv$ docker version
Client version: 1.7.1
Client API version: 1.19
Go version (client): go1.4.2
Git commit (client): 786b29d
OS/Arch (client): darwin/amd64
Server version: 1.7.1
Server API version: 1.19
Go version (server): go1.4.2
Git commit (server): 786b29d
OS/Arch (server): linux/amd64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue that 1.7.1 resolves for me is certificate support - if I
understand the bug right, the Docker daemon was creating a key for
each interface it had, but not all of the interfaces were up at key
init time. The fix was to move DHCP init earlier in the start sequence
so that everything was initialized by the time key creation took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker team is trying to improve code quality by having their
code base pass the &lt;code&gt;golint&lt;/code&gt; test. The open issue,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14784&#34;&gt;fix golint errors/warnings #14784&lt;/a&gt;,
has attracted a swarm of contributors, and a lot of them have
proposed changes that don&amp;rsquo;t pass the automated tests. The build
farm is managed with Jenkins, and you can see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.dockerproject.org/&#34;&gt;status of every build of Docker&lt;/a&gt; on their
dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a full lintable codebase is a great goal. The challenge comes when
the suggested changes by lint send you in the direction of making an
incompatible change to some interface that has the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; name but that
people were relying on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps importantly for the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that currently
all of these tests are done on x86 platforms (Linux and Windows) and there
isn&amp;rsquo;t an official automated build on ARM. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/&#34;&gt;Docker distribution from Hypriot&lt;/a&gt; as my
baseline for working on the Raspberry Pi, with good success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction on I-75 at 13 Mile Road! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20150715/traffic-delays-expected-for-6-weeks-on-i-75-and-13-mile-during-mdot-project&#34;&gt;Expect major delays&lt;/a&gt; at this
project in Madison Heights. From the Oakland Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the construction project, there will be lane closures on both I-75 and 13 Mile Road in Madison Heights, said Diane Cross, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, which is doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(insert map here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the alternative routes look any good, allow extra time for travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components of the postcard project are coming together. So far I have little
pieces that put and get addresses from a database, resize pictures to the
correct size, and generate test and live cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lob a single thoughtful card out every time I have an espresso, there
will be some steady stream of cards going out. Next piece of the checklist is
pulling a report showing which cards are in flight and which ones just arrived
so that I can schedule followups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key bits of sending cards is that your recipient doesn&amp;rsquo;t get them
right away. That gives you a chance to refine your thinking and contemplate
what you have to say when you do follow up when they do get it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coworking notes at Elixir Vitae</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-21-coworking-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 16:57:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-21-coworking-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A productive afternoon with Mohan Kartha in which I opened a great
many tabs in Chrome. This bit of writing to close those out. Elixir
Vitae is a great spot for writing - lots of quiet noise from the coolers
to keep a background hum, and close to the bus station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorting out the simplest task that I&amp;rsquo;d like to do with Node-RED,
now that I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running it under Docker in a configuration
that&amp;rsquo;s reliable enough that it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s stable. The easiest
network test in the world is the ping test, and so my first stab at
a try for &amp;ldquo;run always&amp;rdquo; is a simple configuration to notice when the
network looks like it&amp;rsquo;s down and when it is to collect some more
detailed information and log it to a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for that is this simple configuration from an idea
by Nathan Chantrell, implemented by Martin Harizanov in 2014.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://harizanov.com/2014/03/presence-detection-using-phones-wifi-and-node-red/&#34;&gt;Presence detection using phoneâ€™s WiFi and Node-RED&lt;/a&gt; relies on static
IP address assignments from DHCP, plus &amp;ldquo;ping&amp;rdquo;, to notice if
someone&amp;rsquo;s device is in the building, turned on, and listening to
wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough phones drain their battery to know that absence
of a wifi signal is not an unambiguous marker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantelope is doing a beta product launch at the final AFC Ann Arbor minor
league soccer game of the year, Saturday, July 25 at 6 PM at Hollway
Field (Pioneer High School, 601 W. Stadium, Ann Arbor). See
&lt;a href=&#34;http://fantelope.com/afc-ann-arbor-fantelope-beta-launch/&#34;&gt;the Fantelope web site&lt;/a&gt;
for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first pass at writing code to send postcards from Lob.com is
working. The note to self is that if you have a square bracket in
a URL, that you have to turn off curl&amp;rsquo;s globbing function, e.g.
with -g or &amp;ndash;globoff. &amp;ldquo;When you set this option, you can specify
URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being
interpreted by curl itself. &amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every card has a tracking code, so the next bit of reporting to write
is to see which cards are awaiting printing, which ones are in transit,
where they are going to and whether they have been received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAATA moved the endpoint URL for its old-school &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo;
mobile RideTrak application. To go to a particular route like
the 5, see e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://mobile.theride.org/classic/rideguide_m.asp?route=5&#34;&gt;http://mobile.theride.org/classic/rideguide_m.asp?route=5&lt;/a&gt; .
The main &lt;a href=&#34;http://mobile.theride.org&#34;&gt;http://mobile.theride.org&lt;/a&gt; has a newer interface, but
alas my Windows Phone 8.1 with its Internet Explorer browser
doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that page justice. (That, and I prefer the old interface
because I managed to figure it out for the stop I&amp;rsquo;m always catching
the bus from.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getlittlebird.com/&#34;&gt;Little Bird&lt;/a&gt; promises to
&amp;ldquo;help businesses unlock the valuable information in structured social data&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve asked for a trial to see what they have in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what the best approach is to the task of
&amp;ldquo;download all of my email from Gmail&amp;rdquo;, since the storage I
now have available on my laptop would make it straightforward
to have an 18 GB personal mail spool and because I really actually
would love to search through it so that I can mark some messages
for permanent deletion. One possibility is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enkive.org&#34;&gt;Enkive&lt;/a&gt;
from The Linux Box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reminded that I want to carry around a set of headphones with me
that plug into my Nokia 635 so that I can use the phone as a radio,
and also reminded that I want to try to construct a headphone dipole
as an antenna for my NooElec DVB-T tuner. The challenge will be remembering
those desires at the right time so that when I see the parts I need
in the junk pile at home that I can grab what I need for my every
day carry bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I need to track down an 8 GB USB stick to load a boot ISO on.&lt;/p&gt;
