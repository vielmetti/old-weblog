      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac
under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading
binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software
that&amp;rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully
noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means
that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the
stack until the software you had been using stops working. The easiest
solution is to pull the freshest of the fresh versions, with all
dependencies suitably upgraded as well, so that you can at least
get to par with the latest. Only then can you sort through debug
information and know that if you report a bug it can be repeated
by people who are running current code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Macports this is two commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warning of course is that the second of these two commands
can take a very, very long time, as new software is downloaded
and compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is done! About 12 hours later, I again have a copy of
&lt;code&gt;gqrx&lt;/code&gt; that works, in particular the one that says that it is
&lt;code&gt;Gqrx software defined radio receiver 20151017&lt;/code&gt;. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have waited months to do the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
