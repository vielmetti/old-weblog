      <description>Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software that&amp;rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully noted.
The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the stack until the software you had been using stops working.</description>
