      <description>Gogs is a self-hosted Git server, an alternative to using Github as a for-pay hosted service or Gitlab as another self-hosted system. It&#39;s written in the Go language, and is said to be sparing of system resources.

I&#39;m building it using Docker on a Raspberry Pi 2, thanks to the folks at Hypriot; the writeup is Run your own GitHub-like service with the help of Docker, and the file on Dockerhub is at hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian.</description>

      <description>I won&#39;t be complaining about a small keyboard or a small screen for a while, but I have a lot of tools to reinstall on a new system.
In order of appearance:
Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there&#39;s a working full-screen mode.</description>
