      <description>Thanks to everyone for coming to lunch. We had 16 people, and complete introductions in 23 minutes.
The topic of the question was &amp;ldquo;repair&amp;rdquo;.
 Linda Diane Feldt is repairing her side door, original equipment on a 90 y/o house. Kathryn Sanderson darns socks. Dan Friedus wants to know if you want to repair his 1980s Bolens garden tractors. (Make an offer.) Ruthann Nichols teaches Science and Wine as a freshman seminar at the U.</description>

      <description>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)
This week&amp;#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college.</description>
