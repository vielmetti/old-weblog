      <description>High winds hit southeastern Michigan on Wednesday, March 8 2017. As a result, many DTE customers lost power. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but DTE&amp;rsquo;s estimate is that about 800,000 customers were affected, making this the worst storm in company history.
Even before the peak of the storm, the DTE infrastructure for notifying customers of outage status and gathering incident information from its customers failed. DTE&amp;rsquo;s web site was down for the better part of Wednesdsay, and when it came back up it only had the bare minimum of information, with no outage restoration times available and no public-facing map detail of outages.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR, May 7, 2015: Power outage maps for those utility companies that provide it are listed here by state, alphabetically. As of November 2, 2014, 45 of 50 states have something here.
The list is known to be incomplete, but the list from Wikipedia (outage management system) is also incomplete. To be overly comprehensive, if there are screen captures that I can gather, I will; they will not be current when you look at them, but I will time and date stamp them as best I can.</description>
