      <description>ANN ARBOR, May 7, 2015: Power outage maps for those utility companies that provide it are listed here by state, alphabetically. As of November 2, 2014, 45 of 50 states have something here.
The list is known to be incomplete, but the list from Wikipedia (outage management system) is also incomplete. To be overly comprehensive, if there are screen captures that I can gather, I will; they will not be current when you look at them, but I will time and date stamp them as best I can.</description>
