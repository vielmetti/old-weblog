      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry&#34;&gt;chicken and onion curry&lt;/a&gt;
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431&#34;&gt;daikon raita&lt;/a&gt; from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
