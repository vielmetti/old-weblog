      <description>&lt;p&gt;In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter months it&#39;s harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it&#39;s warm. That all said, there&#39;s no less need to be mindful of how much exercise you are getting when it&#39;s cold out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In days past, I was able to predict my mood rather accurately by checking how many steps I got on my pedometer. If the number was below 5000 you could count on me to be grouchy, and those rare days when the count exceeded 20000 were days when I couldn&#39;t concentrate on much of anything except moving. There&#39;s a seasonally adjusted optimum of approximately 10000 steps - minus a few in winter, plus a few in summer - that I think of as a target that if I happen to move that much in a day that everything else works out OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.walkertracker.com&#34;&gt;Walker Tracker&lt;/a&gt; on and off since 2006, or so the stats tell me, and in that time I&#39;ve logged over 7 million steps. Though the site interface has changed a little bit and my old crowd of fellow pedestrians has mostly moved on from the site, there are still a few familiar faces of people more industrious than I am in logging their activity. I&#39;m looking forward to revisiting it and being a bit more diligent about getting out and about in the winter time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self: buy new mittens, ideally ones that let me have at least one index finger free to work my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self 2: the battery is said to last 6 months, whether you use the system or not, so be prepared to change it on the summer solstice.&lt;/p&gt;
