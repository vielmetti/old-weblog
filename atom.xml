    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Setting up Octopress has given me a chance to look through some of
my old Github repositories and re-assess what&rsquo;s there and how to
improve on them.</p>

<p>This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it
reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a
github account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/aadl-amazon-linky">aadl-amazon-linky</a> and <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">superpatron</a>. Both of these are interfaces
to the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> catalog, which has a very accessible
programming interface with things like RSS feeds for catalog searches.
I&rsquo;d like to go back and revisit two parts of this. One was a Greasemonkey
plugin to put library results in Amazon; that should be a Chrome plugin.
The second was a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edward-vielmetti/79567788/">wall of books</a>&rdquo; report displaying an RSS query as a
page full of book cover images. Of the two, the second looks easiest to
recreate.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/vielmetti-shelltools">vielmetti-shelltools</a>. This is a small collection of shell scripts
that I carry around with me and put on whatever system I happen to be
working on. It would be worthwhile to go back through and compare
what I used then with what I use now and refresh the collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">postcard</a>. This was a hopeful project to use various web-to-postcard
APIs to generate custom postcards on the fly from the command line. Alas,
several of those APIs have disappeared. The real action in this market is
sending a real postcard from your iPhone or Android phone, with products
like <a href="http://postagramapp.com/">Postagram</a> leading the way.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/twitter-mutual-friends">twitter-mutual-friends</a>. Once upon a time, the Twitter API was so
simple that you could write a useful application in four lines of shell
script. Now the API has improved itself, and it&rsquo;s gotten a lot more
complicated. Look at simple apps like <a href="https://github.com/gianu/latest_tweets">latest_tweets</a> by gianu to
get an idea of what you&rsquo;re up against now.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/mobile">mobile</a>. Again, once upon a time, I had a Blackberry phone which
had the world&rsquo;s worst usable web browser. Fortunately there were enough
web sites that had a minimalist presentation that I was able to put
together a directory of workable sites, which I used for quite a while.
Now I have an Android phone that runs Chrome as well as apps and I don&rsquo;t
need the list of sites quite so much; still, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to have
a place to collect them when I find them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So when it&rsquo;s time to write some code here are some ideas for where
to start again!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aha, creating a new post is as easy as</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ rake new_post["Title of your new post"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A permalink will be generated from the title of the page. See the
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">blogging basics</a> page for more.</p>

<p>Blockquotes work like so:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lincolns and Olds, Michiganders</p><footer><strong>Michael Joyce</strong> <cite>BAD:IDEA</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-0476?byte=115058701;focusrgn=C02;subview=standard;view=reslist">BAD:IDEA</a> is an online conference that Bill Doster and I organized more
25 years ago, in 1987; it&rsquo;s tied up in the U of Michigan archives protected by
FERPA. I need to pry it loose (since it&rsquo;s my educational records, I should
be able to see them).</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='styled with CSS'>
If you are going to use a <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/pullquote/">pull quote</a> in your paragraph, just write
as normal. You&rsquo;ll find the one pithy piece that makes the whole thing
hang together, and you&rsquo;ll call it out with simple punctuation. The
pull quote is styled with CSS so there&rsquo;s no duplication of text and
no need to write things in a funny way to make it make sense. The only
slightly weird thing is that the pull quote text is not selectable,
even though it looks like it should be. That&rsquo;s mighty fancy CSS
footwork!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With any new system there&rsquo;s a tendency to give a lot of things a try.
Here&rsquo;s some more observations from the new part of things.</p>

<p>Comments are now enabled here through <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>. I don&rsquo;t expect that
there will be a lot of comments, but at least there is an easy way
to integrate them. The default configuration included a lot of &ldquo;promoted
posts&rdquo; at the bottom of the screen; I guess that if you click on those,
there&rsquo;s some small chance that I might get some small amount of money.
They are also somewhat distracting.</p>

    <id>http://vielmetti.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/notes-on-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some notes while I am still new to the system.</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t have comments; presumably there&rsquo;s some way to wire up
an external comment system of some type to handle that, like Disqus.</li>
<li>I really wanted to start doing this by having a flexible sidebar.
There is a sidebar with some default information in it (github repos,
recent pinboard bookmarks) but not a flexible editable sidebar. I suppose
that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s source code.</li>
<li>I miss &ldquo;edit this page&rdquo; as a button; that&rsquo;s the downside of not having
a web-based content management system.</li>
<li>Out of the box it looks nicer than Jekyll&rsquo;s default config, and I
heartily approve of that. I am sure there are other styles I can try too.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to have to step up my reading skills if I&rsquo;m going to understand
everything behind this system, especially my Ruby reading skills.</li>
<li>The default config&rsquo;s mobile design is pretty good on my phone, better
than the best I&rsquo;ve been able to do so far with Typepad.</li>
<li>I like it that github is doing the hosting because there&rsquo;s not much to
worry about that &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have to do any more in the way of babysitting
a machine just to have a blog.</li>
</ol>


<p>So far so good, nothing too weird, everything pretty straightforward.</p>

    <link href="http://vielmetti.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/installing-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-11T17:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vielmetti.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/installing-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Started to install <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> on my Mac, but got into a problem
where one of the dependencies wanted a later version of ruby
(or at least a later patchlevel) than the one I had just built.
That&rsquo;s enough to stop me for now.</p>

<p>But not for very long!</p>

<p>This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10553887/having-trouble-installing-any-ruby-1-9-x-with-rbenv-on-mac-osx-due-to-psych-ya">Stack Overflow</a> post gives the syntax for installing a particular
patchlevel of ruby, and so I did it.</p>

<p>Then it came to creating a repo on github, and I got confused; should
the URL be vielmetti.github.com or vielmetti.github.io ? Because one part
of the doc used one name and the in-line code example used another. I
had a skew between the two, and now it looks like things are hopelessly
confused (or at least confused enough that I should delete a repo and
start over).</p>

<p>Finally, I found this <a href="http://www.nicecabbage.com/blog/2012/03/04/blogging-for-rubyists/">Nice Cabbage</a> post which strips the install
down to its very barest minimum; that brought me past a hurdle with
the above mentioned github repo.</p>

<p>One last issue: the system was complaining with an OS X credentials error,
&ldquo;error: git-credential-osxkeychain died of signal 11&rdquo;. To fix that, I went
to a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">page where I could get the latest version</a> and updated my copy.</p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re reading this, it must work! Yay!</p>
