      <description>Some notes, more for myself than for you.
Horseradish is now available at market; $4 for a jar from Grandma&amp;#39;s Kitchen.&amp;#0160; Grandma says hers is pure, not mixed with turnip as some would do.&amp;#0160; Farmers Market had a lot of produce - field greens and flowers were the big new crops.&amp;#0160; We had some tat soi from Shannon Brines that was very good in a stir fry.
The phone on the farm in Homer, MI is answered only at 8am, if I read the handout right.</description>

      <description>A second try at menu plan Monday, written Sunday night.
Farmer&amp;#39;s market on Saturday was eggs, apples, some good conversation and not much more food.&amp;#0160; We didn&amp;#39;t get there early enough for fresh greens from Brines Farm, and by the time we were there Wasem&amp;#39;s was out of donuts.&amp;#0160; Still a lot of fun.
Food coop was pleasant, but I didn&amp;#39;t do most of my shopping there.&amp;#0160; Next week I&amp;#39;ll do shopping for spices there, since their selection is best and they are never out of stock of anything.</description>
