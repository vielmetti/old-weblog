      <description>Full text of Anton Chekov&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Gooseberries&amp;quot; is available at Eldritch Press.&amp;#0160;An excerpt from this short story:
 &amp;quot;But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted.</description>
