      <description>We had purple beans for dinner, from farmer&amp;#39;s market.&amp;#0160; I heated some olive oil in a pan and cooked them through until they had turned all green, and then salted them a little at the end.
The recipe called for adding chopped almonds but it didn&amp;#39;t happen; instead I served the boys tofu that I had cut into cubes and boiled (boiling it improves the texture quite a bit, firming it up more to my liking).</description>
