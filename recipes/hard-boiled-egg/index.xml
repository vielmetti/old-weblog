      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Roos, an espresso over ice with a little half and half and a hard
boiled egg. It&amp;rsquo;s a very compact breakfast. The espresso is served in
an appropriately sized glass mug and tastes like the strongest little
iced latte you will ever have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my Mac, run &amp;lsquo;boot2docker upgrade&amp;rsquo;. That gets me up to current 1.7.1
revision of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Edwards-MacBook-Air:~ emv$ docker version
Client version: 1.7.1
Client API version: 1.19
Go version (client): go1.4.2
Git commit (client): 786b29d
OS/Arch (client): darwin/amd64
Server version: 1.7.1
Server API version: 1.19
Go version (server): go1.4.2
Git commit (server): 786b29d
OS/Arch (server): linux/amd64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue that 1.7.1 resolves for me is certificate support - if I
understand the bug right, the Docker daemon was creating a key for
each interface it had, but not all of the interfaces were up at key
init time. The fix was to move DHCP init earlier in the start sequence
so that everything was initialized by the time key creation took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker team is trying to improve code quality by having their
code base pass the &lt;code&gt;golint&lt;/code&gt; test. The open issue,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14784&#34;&gt;fix golint errors/warnings #14784&lt;/a&gt;,
has attracted a swarm of contributors, and a lot of them have
proposed changes that don&amp;rsquo;t pass the automated tests. The build
farm is managed with Jenkins, and you can see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.dockerproject.org/&#34;&gt;status of every build of Docker&lt;/a&gt; on their
dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a full lintable codebase is a great goal. The challenge comes when
the suggested changes by lint send you in the direction of making an
incompatible change to some interface that has the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; name but that
people were relying on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps importantly for the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that currently
all of these tests are done on x86 platforms (Linux and Windows) and there
isn&amp;rsquo;t an official automated build on ARM. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/&#34;&gt;Docker distribution from Hypriot&lt;/a&gt; as my
baseline for working on the Raspberry Pi, with good success.&lt;/p&gt;
