      <description>This is the family latke recipe, perfected over time. Ten pounds of potatoes serves one neighborhood.
Warning: the following recipe may be bad for your health and completely destructive of your kitchen!
From a newspaper clipping in my recipe book, much amended by me over the years:
POTATO PANCAKES Time: 20 minutes (More like two hours, unless you have multiple griddles)
2 large eggs 3 cups grated drained, all-purpose potatoes (see below) 1/4 cup grated onion (see below) 1 teaspoon salt, more to taste (less) 2 to 4 tablespoons matzo meal, or as needed (I used whole wheat flour; you could also use breadcrumbs) Canola oil, for frying Applesauce and sour cream for serving, optional (mandatory!</description>
