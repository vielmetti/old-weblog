      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year I look forward to finding pea greens, so that I can stir fry them up.&amp;#0160; And every year at the farmer&amp;#39;s market I don&amp;#39;t find them.&amp;#0160; I hope this year can be different, but I have some questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to grow pea greens on my own, what variety of peas would I use?&lt;br /&gt;Are pea vines usually sprayed, and would you want to look out for no-spray vendors?&lt;br /&gt;When is the best time to pick?&lt;br /&gt;Do you lose all of the pod harvest or can you have both?&lt;br /&gt;If I harvested a bushel of vines from a U-Pick operation would they look at me funny?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our traditional pea-picking weekend here is Father&amp;#39;s Day, when we go to Rawsonville for peas and strawberries and we make sure to take sunblock and water (note to future self).&lt;/p&gt;
