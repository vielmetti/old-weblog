            <p>Edward Vielmetti has been writing the Vacuum weblog since 1999 from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The topics vary widely, with over 2000 entries in the whole collection.
In the interest of simplifying the presentation, some parts of this collection are currently offline, and the front page has some mix of meditation and detail.
The current set of systems that are an area of focus - and the places I draw from for inspiration on each - are as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/about-this-weblog/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Gitbook is an online service for writing books. It uses a version of Markdown for writing your book copy, and stores versions in a git repository. There are several template user interface designs, including one that reads like a FAQ or question and answer section, designed to be read one page at a time.
I&rsquo;ve set up my own Gitbook account at http://gitbook.com/@vielmetti with a first book. Entitled A field guide to the Internet, abridged, it&rsquo;s a very brief guide to some of the things you might find on the Internet if you were only looking in Ann Arbor for stuff about Ann Arbor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w26-2-gitbook/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A new job means a new computer. I&rsquo;m keeping the old one plugged in in the attic, and setting up the new one from scratch without doing a wholesale file copy.
The old machine had done good service, but I made a mistake when buying it of not getting the maximum sized SSD drive. At the end I was running at 95% disk full - that&rsquo;s no way to run a system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w25-7-new-system-checklist/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>When I first used computer systems, there were a lot more user interfaces that felt like adventure games. You&rsquo;d be presented with a prompt, and the rest of the user interface would be largely concealed. It would be up to you to deduce a proper function of the system by trying all of the plausible responses to the prompt - including &ldquo;help&rdquo; or &ldquo;?&rdquo;, which might work but you would never really know until you tried them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w20-2-do-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>When you bought your textbooks, did you evaluate them on how well color-coded the highlighting was in the used copies? If someone before you had turned the page into an angry fruit salad, the value of the text diminished. If instead they were careful and methodical and deft with the use of their marker, the text would be that much easier to read.
I&rsquo;m experimenting with color-coding here, in particular in three ways. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w19-5-color-coded-words/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I have a system and a method for writing. It involves assigning a word count, picking a key word that needs to be repeated, and setting a deadline. When executed faithfully, this system is fool-resistant. I hesitate to say foolproof &ldquo;because fools are so ingenious&rdquo;.
A systematic approach to writing seems like a cheat, the result of some pay-by-the-word grind from a particularly merciless body shop. Where is the spontaneity, the vigor, the inspiration when it comes to producing prose? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w18-7-system/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>My method for keeping an inbox in check enough that it periodically hits a zero point relies heavily on having a second system in which to store bits of work in progress. In my case this is a private Github issue store which has now over 6900 issues in it, about 6800 of which have been closed.
There&rsquo;s not magic to this approach, other than relentless use of Github&rsquo;s flexible issues management tool. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w18-7-inbox-juggling/">&raquo;</a></p>

Hugo in this 0.20 new release promises a lot of new features, including but not limited to support for rendering calendars. I&rsquo;ll give it a try.
One of my goals of Hugo is getting it to run on linux/arm64. It should be easy, since it&rsquo;s written in Go, and golang ports are absurdly easy. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w15-1-upgrade-to-hugo-0-20/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Terraform is a provisioning tool from Hashicorp. It manages the process of setting up and tearing down and updating your computing infrastructure. Commands necessary to set up your machines are stored in files, with just enough language features in that configuration description language to accomplish simple automation efforts and to keep secrets out of common config files.
Terraform lives in the same computational universe as other packages like Vagrant, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w13-7-learning-terraform/">&raquo;</a></p>

State one is really old, stable, standardized, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; code, well documented, portable, runs everywhere, easy to port to new systems and architectures. The &ldquo;curl&rdquo; library is probably the archetype of this, written in C.
State two is really new, unstable, exciting, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; code, always changing, designed largely for a 64-bit Intel architecture, and unpredictably hard or easy to port to new systems and architectures. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w13-2-everything-depends-on-latest/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt collaborated on a card deck of strategies for overcoming creative blocks. This was produced in limited and somewhat varying editions, and when it escaped into the computing world at slightly later date, various electronic versions were produced (including one in FORTRAN). Prentiss Riddle noted some of this history in 2004.
The &lsquo;oblique&rsquo; code is simple; a file with strategies, one per line, and a function to return a random line from that file. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w12-4-oblique-strategy-as-a-service/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A well-managed software project will inevitably have issues come up that need discussion and resolution. These might be out-and-out bugs, but more often than not they are also difficulties that people have getting started running something complex, or issues that arise when building for an environment that is not the same as what the developers have experienced.
The best projects I&rsquo;ve seen have used the ability for Github to provide a template for the issue report. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w11-4-issue-reporting/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>High winds hit southeastern Michigan on Wednesday, March 8 2017. As a result, many DTE customers lost power. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but DTE&rsquo;s estimate is that about 800,000 customers were affected, making this the worst storm in company history.
Even before the peak of the storm, the DTE infrastructure for notifying customers of outage status and gathering incident information from its customers failed. DTE&rsquo;s web site was down for the better part of Wednesdsay, and when it came back up it only had the bare minimum of information, with no outage restoration times available and no public-facing map detail of outages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w10-4-dte-power-outage/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>Amazon Web Services had downtime yesterday. Their S3 storage service had what was described as elevated error rates in the US-East zone, and as a result failures started in other AWS services in US-East that depended on S3.
The failures were reminiscent of the DynamoDB downtime of September 20, 2015, in that seemingly unrelated services share a common failure mode because of unforeseen interdependencies.
 A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w09-3-aws-s3-downtime/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>To &ldquo;dogfood&rdquo; comes from the phrase &ldquo;to eat your own dogfood&rdquo;, giving the sense that you are not only producing a product but also consuming it as well. This is intended to show that you care so much about your customers success in using that product that you are willing to use it the way they are intended to use it.
&ldquo;Dogfooding&rdquo; is thus shorthand for actually depending on something that you make yourself for sale. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-4-dogfooding/">&raquo;</a></p>

The question to be answered is how to manage Docker containers - not just how to get them running, but also how to poke inside them while they are running to see what they are doing and make sure that you can make sense of what is happening while you develop or run in production. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-12-28-watching-containers-with-portainer-and-sysdig/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Tectonic Summit was a conference in New York City in December 2016, hosted by CoreOS, with the theme Enterprise Kubernetes. Mohan Kartha and Edward Vielmetti went there as a guest of Packet, a bare-metal hosting provider in the city. This report details highlights of the presentations at the event as well as accounts from attendees of what they thought was missing from the presentation and discussions.
