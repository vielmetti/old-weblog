            <p>Edward Vielmetti has been writing the Vacuum weblog since 1999 from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The topics vary widely, with over 2000 entries in the whole collection.
In the interest of simplifying the presentation, some parts of this collection are currently offline, and the front page has some mix of meditation and detail.
The current set of systems that are an area of focus - and the places I draw from for inspiration on each - are as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/about-this-weblog/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Terraform is a provisioning tool from Hashicorp. It manages the process of setting up and tearing down and updating your computing infrastructure. Commands necessary to set up your machines are stored in files, with just enough language features in that configuration description language to accomplish simple automation efforts and to keep secrets out of common config files.
Terraform lives in the same computational universe as other packages like Vagrant, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w13-7-learning-terraform/">&raquo;</a></p>

State one is really old, stable, standardized, &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; code, well documented, portable, runs everywhere, easy to port to new systems and architectures. The &ldquo;curl&rdquo; library is probably the archetype of this, written in C.
State two is really new, unstable, exciting, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; code, always changing, designed largely for a 64-bit Intel architecture, and unpredictably hard or easy to port to new systems and architectures. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w13-2-everything-depends-on-latest/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt collaborated on a card deck of strategies for overcoming creative blocks. This was produced in limited and somewhat varying editions, and when it escaped into the computing world at slightly later date, various electronic versions were produced (including one in FORTRAN). Prentiss Riddle noted some of this history in 2004.
The &lsquo;oblique&rsquo; code is simple; a file with strategies, one per line, and a function to return a random line from that file. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w12-4-oblique-strategy-as-a-service/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>A well-managed software project will inevitably have issues come up that need discussion and resolution. These might be out-and-out bugs, but more often than not they are also difficulties that people have getting started running something complex, or issues that arise when building for an environment that is not the same as what the developers have experienced.
The best projects I&rsquo;ve seen have used the ability for Github to provide a template for the issue report. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w11-4-issue-reporting/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>High winds hit southeastern Michigan on Wednesday, March 8 2017. As a result, many DTE customers lost power. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but DTE&rsquo;s estimate is that about 800,000 customers were affected, making this the worst storm in company history.
Even before the peak of the storm, the DTE infrastructure for notifying customers of outage status and gathering incident information from its customers failed. DTE&rsquo;s web site was down for the better part of Wednesdsay, and when it came back up it only had the bare minimum of information, with no outage restoration times available and no public-facing map detail of outages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w10-4-dte-power-outage/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>Amazon Web Services had downtime yesterday. Their S3 storage service had what was described as elevated error rates in the US-East zone, and as a result failures started in other AWS services in US-East that depended on S3.
The failures were reminiscent of the DynamoDB downtime of September 20, 2015, in that seemingly unrelated services share a common failure mode because of unforeseen interdependencies.
 A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w09-3-aws-s3-downtime/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>To &ldquo;dogfood&rdquo; comes from the phrase &ldquo;to eat your own dogfood&rdquo;, giving the sense that you are not only producing a product but also consuming it as well. This is intended to show that you care so much about your customers success in using that product that you are willing to use it the way they are intended to use it.
&ldquo;Dogfooding&rdquo; is thus shorthand for actually depending on something that you make yourself for sale. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-4-dogfooding/">&raquo;</a></p>

Some times new systems present as &ldquo;greenfield&rdquo; opportunities, with brand-new things to do that don&rsquo;t require much in the way of adherence to what&rsquo;s gone on in the past.

            <p>I am reminded again of Karl Weick&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;small wins&rdquo;, the observation that large problems are so large that we are overwhelmed just in thinking about them. It can be incredibly powerful to have a series of small wins that provide some momentum and that set you up for increasing confidence and capability to tackle bigger issues.
My small win of the moment is getting this blog post up, reminding myself that once upon a time I met a writing deadline every day for publication, and knowing that it&rsquo;s not necessary for every single post to be a big thing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-1-small-wins/">&raquo;</a></p>

I can never keep track of the day of the month, it seems. The watch on my wrist has a day marker, but it wants to have a 31 day month, and when we have 30 or 28 day months the day has to be manually adjusted. On the other hand, I have a keen sense for what day of the week it is. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w03-5-iso-date-format/">&raquo;</a></p>

As always, when there&rsquo;s a leap second, people get a chance to debug their timekeeping code.

The question to be answered is how to manage Docker containers - not just how to get them running, but also how to poke inside them while they are running to see what they are doing and make sure that you can make sense of what is happening while you develop or run in production. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-12-28-watching-containers-with-portainer-and-sysdig/">&raquo;</a></p>

The first thing I noticed is that memory usage for Opera is way less than for Chrome.

A framework is a set of libraries and coding conventions that makes development in a specific language for a specific task easier. That usually involves making some simplifying assumptions about the task you are trying to solve, and embedding those assumptions in your code so that you don&rsquo;t have to spell out quite as much detail to get a task done. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-10-13-aws-lambda-with-chalice/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Duong Dinh Cuong (on Github as cuongquay) has contributed a node for Node-RED that encapsulates the AWS IoT service and allows straightforward communication between the two systems over MQTT.
The node, node-red-contrib-aws-iot-hub, includes support for the message-passing part of AWS IoT using MQTT, allowing you to open a channel to the IoT service and publish or subscribe to message topics. The result is easy integration between the two systems. As a part of this process, the node includes support for AWS certificates that have to be installed &ldquo;just so&rdquo; to allow AWS to trust Node-RED. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-10-11-aws-iot-to-node-red/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>In the process of looking at embedded radio components, I came across the u-blox SARA-N2, a low power device designed to provide low bandwidth cellular data coverage for Internet of Things devices - &ldquo;low power consumption and extended coverage&rdquo; being the operative buzzwords. Speeds are 227 Kbps down and 21 Kbps up, and it&rsquo;s claimed to be &ldquo;low power&rdquo; though no specific power consumption figures are provided.
It&rsquo;s built on NB-IoT standards that are standardized in June 2016 by the 3GPP project and which are codified in their Release 13. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-10-10-nb-iot/">&raquo;</a></p>
