		<title>Disable Quiet Hours on your Windows Phone 8.1 so you always take that late night call</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>10 May 2015</h3>
		<h1>Disable Quiet Hours on your Windows Phone 8.1 so you always take that late night call</h1> 
		<p>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it's running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it's also quite economical.</p>

<p>That said, there's one feature on the phone that wasn't a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him. The phone has wifi calling so it should have worked just fine where I was, a spot that has poor cell reception. But the call never came, and by the time I idly checked my messages I had missed several calls. How did that happen?</p>

<p>Windows Phone and Cortana has a feature called Quiet Hours. In <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-quiet-hours-and-inner-circles-windows-phone-81">How to set up Quiet Hours and Inner Circles on Windows Phone 8.1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsabri">Sam Sabri</a> writes for Windows Central a nice tutorial on how to set it up and configure the phone to not ring during some hours of the day and to allow some people to specially ring the phone even when it's set to no ring. It's a good tutorial, and if I had read it carefully and thought it through I could have set it up to always take calls from important people late at night.</p>

<p>The truth is, though, that I already have another phone system (Google Voice) that I could already use to reroute or divert calls, and having that power in my phone though nice is the opposite of what I wanted. If it's late and someone calls me, I want to take the call. So my suggestion to you for your new Windows Phone is - if you want to use it as a phone - that you start out your device setup by disabling Quiet Hours, and only add it back in once you have thought it through very carefully.</p>

	Recreating more or less my original layout, but with
