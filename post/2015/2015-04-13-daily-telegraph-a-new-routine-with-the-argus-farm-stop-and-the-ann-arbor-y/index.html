		<title>Daily telegraph: A new routine with the Argus Farm Stop and the Ann Arbor Y</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>13 April 2015</h3>
		<h1>Daily telegraph: A new routine with the Argus Farm Stop and the Ann Arbor Y</h1> 
		<p>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn't have school and so I didn't actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.</p>

<p>The first piece of the new routine is getting to the <a href="http://www.annarborymca.org/">Ann Arbor YMCA</a>. If the weather is nice and I don't have anything else going on, it's a nice bike ride; if I'm making a car trip into town for school, it's close enough to be a good next stop. The only slight problem with the Y during the day is parking, not that I'd spend money on parking, but that everyone knows to park on West Washington St. There's nothing quite like a sauna in the morning to get you going, and there's a lovely little library by the pool with a very fast wifi and good power outlets.</p>

<p>The second piece of the new routine is <a href="http://www.argusfarmstop.com/">Argus Farm Stop</a>. I had been in here when it first opened, but now the routine has settled down a bit, and after the 8:00 a.m - 9:00 a.m. coffee rush it's a pretty reasonable spot to sit and type. There's delicious day-old bread to be had at reasonable prices and they will lop off an end for you to chew on while you drink your coffee. As a bonus the parking on Second St usually has a free space on one side or another at 8:00 a.m. so I can walk to the Y, do my thing, walk back, sit for a bit and type some more, and be good to go by 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>The conversation at the Farm Stop is sparkling - talked to a fellow named Granger who's moving here from Colorado about food, where to get a good bi bim bap, and his plans with his friends to open up a glass shop in town. [Kathy Sample] was behind the counter sorting out the morning flow and talking about the farmers bringing in their produce and their meats.</p>

<p>Between those two changes I now can pretty much count on being bathed, fed, watered, and have a little bit of shopping done by 10:00 a.m. If the weather is nice, I get a bike ride in to start the day, and I haven't spent any pennies on parking, and it also works to take the bus.</p>
