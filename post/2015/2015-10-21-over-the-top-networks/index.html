		<h3>21 October 2015</h3>
		<h1>Over the top networks</h1> 
		<p>I&rsquo;m giving a talk on Over The Top Networks at the Radical/Networks
conference in Brooklyn this weekend, October 24-25 2015.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to say in what order yet, but&hellip;
the best way to predict that is to write down some notes. So here we go.</p>

<p>The premise, briefly stated, is that most successful networks run
&ldquo;over the top&rdquo; of existing working networks, and that you can learn
a lot from what goes wrong along the way when the underlying network
fights back.</p>

<p>Lots of examples, here&rsquo;s just some of them.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>APRS is a worldwide location sharing system that runs over amateur packet
radio. It runs &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; of VHF radios, and sends out location
information for participating nodes to digital repeaters (&ldquo;digipeaters&rdquo;) that
relay the signal to others in the participating mesh. It&rsquo;s designed
initially to be completely free of external infrastructure dependencies,
except for some good source of location information provided by GPS.</p>

<p>This network worked fine at first, but as it got more popular, the network
got more congested. A single transmission from a moving vehicle would trigger
two or three rounds of repeaters resending the message, and in places
where the network was dense with stations there would be collisions on
the single radio channel. To compensate, some stations would set their
initial broadcast to repeat four or five times, increasing their own
chance of getting heard at the expense of more congestion network-wide.</p>

<p>The solution ended up being fairly simple, once the Internet got to be
reliable enough. An internet gateway (&ldquo;I-Gate&rdquo;) was set up to capture
location information shared by radios, so that instead of transmitting this
data via collision-prone VHF radios, it went over the Internet. A much
small number of internet-enabled gateways were able to handle the load,
and it allowed stations that only had Internet connections to participate
in the network by sending their location reports directly to the I-Gate.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of radio lessons to be learned from the saga of APRS.
Stations sharing a single low-speed narrow band radio channel have to
work extra hard not to collide with each other, and the &ldquo;hidden terminal&rdquo;
problem (where a station interferes with another station that it can&rsquo;t hear,
but that can hear it) ensures that network density leads to more problems.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>Usenet News started in 1979 in North Carolina, connecting computers in
the Research Triangle between Duke and the University of North Carolina.
It grew rapidly in the 1980s, taking advantage of whatever networks
were available to it. The relatively simple Unix-to-Unix Copy approach
to networking meant that virtually any data network that could be coaxed
into sending a data stream unmodified over a circuit could be put to use.</p>

<p>Usenet ran over the top of dialup phone lines in its early times,
and this posed a problem: long distance calls cost money. Several
methods were used to great effect to get away from this financial
limitation on network growth.</p>

<p>One very simple way to bypass telephone bills is to have the telephone
company call you. Researchers at Bell Labs, the home of Unix, had a great
interest in seeing the network succeed, and thus they routinely set up
their systems to make large numbers of outbound telephone calls to poll
remote stations for mail and news. The costs of toll long distance
telephone service were hidden inside the phone company&rsquo;s own phone bills,
as well as the phone bills of several other large computer companies
where agile systems staff were able to avoid the attention of bean
counters (who would probably not have approved of spending corporate
dollars to retransmit rec.pets.cats).</p>

<p>A parallel approach was to reuse dialup networks originally designed
for terminals to connect to mainframe computers and repurpose them for
machine-to-machine use. In Michigan, the statewide MERIT computer network
was designed to connect research and education computing across the state.
Clever systems programmers (including yours truly) realized that it could
be also used to support slow but functional UUCP connections, and that
those links would not incur any per-hour or per-kilobyte charges. Thus
a bulletin board system in Michigan&rsquo;s remote Upper Peninsula could get
free worldwide email and Usenet news feeds by befriending the right people
in Ann Arbor and adapting the particular arcane configuration.</p>

<p>As Usenet grew, the demand for bandwidth started to outstrip the
capacity of dialup telephone circuits. This led to efforts to use and
reuse the new source of &ldquo;free&rdquo; long-distance data services, namely the
evolving Internet of its day. By the time the National Science Foundation
had christened its super-fast, 1.5 megabit per second network, Usenet
News admins were ready with the NNTP protocol which could take best
advantage of the new network.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that over the 10 year lifespan of the NSFnet that public
sources contributed over $2 billion to the network - $200 million direct
from the NSF, and the rest from a variety of state sources. By 1995,
Usenet News was consuming about 8% of the bandwidth provided by the network.
If that&rsquo;s a plausible overall measure of the relative cost of that traffic,
that means that Usenet News could have had as much as a $160 million subsidy
over 10 years to grow and expand on the public dime. A good system to
build on top of!</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the challenges of building a successful network is that at
some point you look like a system that can be exploited for other
people&rsquo;s use, just in the same way that your system exploited some
aspect of the surrounding environment to get its toehold into the
world. Two moments in the early 1990s development of Usenet show
signs of what would be its demise as a discussion forum dominiated
by researchers and graduate students.</p>

<hr />

<p>Up until September 1993, the ebb and flow of Usenet as a discussion
medium was pretty predictable. A network dominated by graduate students,
Usenet typically got a lot of new users in September, who floundered
around until they either dropped off the net or sorted out how to use
it effectively. A year later another September would roll around, and
last year&rsquo;s new users were now this year&rsquo;s seasoned veterans, showing
the newbies around or harrassing them or both.</p>

<p>September 1993 changed all of that because America Online, the biggest
online service at the time, decided to add Usenet access to its millions
of commercial customers. Not surprisingly, these new users were different
from the ones that came before them - they were more often that not
far removed from the academic and research and hobbyist networks that
had come before them on Usenet. A culture clash ensued, and in some
ways Usenet never recovered.</p>

<p>AOL&rsquo;s embrace of Usenet is a classic &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; maneuver. AOL did
not have to hire any new moderation staff, run transcontinental networks, or
invent any new protocols to join in this existing network. Instead, they
could gather all of the benefits of providing their user base with access
to new services at a very small marginal cost.</p>

<hr />

<p>Taking advantage of Usenet is also the theme of advertising networks
that took heed of Usenet&rsquo;s worldwide low cost distribution system to
plant their own unsolicited commercial messages.</p>

<p>Usenet had always been somewhat commercialized, ever since the first
person posted an ad for a dinette set for sale in New Jersey. Employment
advertising was tolerated or even welcomed, and regional &ldquo;forsale&rdquo;
groups prefigured Craigslist in many ways. But there was a social contract
that kept cooperating systems away from wholesale advertising. Sending
articles around the world costs money, and if the powers that be
knew that you were sending ads around on their dime they&rsquo;d kick you
(or us) off the net.</p>

<p>By 1994, though, the social contract had weakened a bit. Commericial
internet service providers were selling dialup Usenet accounts, and
AOL was offering rec.pets.cats to the masses. How natural would it be
for someone to observe that they could get huge numbers of ad impressions
for little or no money to a receptive audience?</p>

<p>Enter the &ldquo;Green Card Lawyers&rdquo;, Canter and Siegel.
With the help of a programmer they designed an ad campaign that would
promote their immigrant legal aid to over 5500 separate newsgroups at
once. This burst of traffic - a separate ad for each and every Usenet
newsgroup they could find - was so substantial that they managed to
take some parts of the network offline (New Zealand, in particular,
which had some of the highest costs of importing Usenet anywhere, disconnected
temporarily rather than transmit the onslaught).</p>

<p>Sadly, the Usenet community response to the Green Card Lawyers and
their ilk was a sign that the community infrastructure of Usenet
was going to have to adapt to a world where some members of the network
were hostile and were going to try to subvert the cooperative enterprise
with advertising. Unsolicited ads all sorts of things followed -
sketchy pharmaceutical advertisements promoting male enhancement drugs
were perhaps the most typical. The Usenet architecture started to crumble,
as people looking to escape the noise fled to private email lists,
and as institutions supporting the net looked twice at their costs and
decided it might not be worth it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I keep coming back to Usenet because it&rsquo;s so fascinating, and I spent
so much time there, and surprisingly enough it&rsquo;s still going. What can
over the top networks learn from its surprising longevity, even though
several generations of technologists have given up on it?</p>

<p>Usenet is the prototypical mesh network. Individual nodes in the network
connect to each other, without needing any central authority to bless them.
They connect using whatever technology they agree to, without needing
to adhere to any central standard except for the format of news articles.
The network works with a &ldquo;flooding&rdquo; protocol that distributes texts to
all parts of the network that are connected that want to receive them,
and aspects of the flooding algorithm ensure efficiency and that no
one gets an article sent to them twice. For a 1979 design, it&rsquo;s held up well.</p>

<p>What has changed irrevocably from the original is the content on the network.
Once upon a time, in the days before widespread use of the Internet, it
served as an amalgam of what emerged as all sorts of independent commercial
services. Modern day Github is an echo of the old comp.sources.* hierarchy,
delivering source code and patches and enhancements to your door. Quora
and Stack Overlow try to replicated the comp.* newsgroups, and
Reddit handles most of rec.*. Many if not most of the original newsgroups
are dead, overrun by spam.</p>

<p>What lives on is the alt.* newsgroups, in particular alt.binaries.*. These
were never welcomed by the old guard who remembered how expensive it
was to transmit anything over a modem, but now over 30 years later
the cost of the network is so low.</p>

<p>The modern Usenet ends up being a vast expanse of digitized video,
and a host of specialized newsreaders designed to quickly scoop
down the movie or TV show that you want to watch. The distribution
and flooding algorithms are perfect for this task, and copyright
owners have to work extra hard because even taking down one copyrighted
work from one part of the network doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from pulling it
from some other area.</p>

<hr />

<p>I want to fast forward a bit from the 1990s to the modern day, to
illustrate that all sorts of contemporary networks have bootstrapped
their way to success on top of other, older infrastructure.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first common pattern I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;identity proxy&rdquo;. The idea here is
that you can take advantage of an existing organization&rsquo;s identification
process, without ever having to know someone&rsquo;s login and password.
By extending privileges to anyone who can prove that they are a
member of some other organization, you can scoop up valuable early
users.</p>

<p>Facebook is one excellent example of this, especialy in its early days.
How do you restrict access to your brand new social network so that only
the social elites can participate? Simple, the onboarding process for
your new network runs over the top of the email system of the network
you want to attract from. Anyone who wants an account has to prove
that they can get an email from a harvard.edu address. Voila, you have
just run your login system over the top of a very expensive and valuable
college admissions process, at minimal cost to yourself.</p>

<p>Slack runs the same strategy when trying to recruit companies to use its
product. You can configure a Slack instance so that anyone who has an
email address in a particular domain is automatically approved. This gives
Slack leverage to gather employees for its &ldquo;free&rdquo; service and insight
to get those people into its paid service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Identity proxy&rdquo; is a powerful pattern. If you find the right trove
of people who have a desirable email address, you can scoop them up
into your system and exclude others who don&rsquo;t have the right qualifying
talisman.</p>
