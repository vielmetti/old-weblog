      <p>I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don't think that's the part of the hobby I'm most interested in.</p>

<p>The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you'd think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that's hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. It feels really noisy and unnecessarily difficult. I am told that some contesters use software defined radio to watch more of the band - that seems more effective than just listening to one narrow channel and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>I guess I'm much more used to using repeaters than I am to simplex operations. With a repeater at least you have a positive acknowledgement that your transmission was received by a machine, and with that you can get a better sense for what you sound like on the air. I'm also used to a station acting as "net control" and acknowledging people and managing the flow of conversations. In contrast the contest sounds like chaos.</p>

<p>For whatever the unfamiliarity is, the other reality is that to listen to it, contests can be pretty boring. People give out the barest of bare minimum of information about their station and then move on.</p>

<p>What Field Day brings to mind is a much more interesting event I was a little part of last year, the <a href="http://www.nj2bb.org/museum/">Museum Ships Weekend Event</a> run by The Battleship New Jersey Amateur Radio Station NJ2BB. I went to the Hands-On Museum in early June 2014 and listened and talked to shipboard radio stations on museum ships around the world. It was a lot more fun because the station operators were less concerned about maximizing the count of their contacts and more interested in telling the stories of their museums. </p>
