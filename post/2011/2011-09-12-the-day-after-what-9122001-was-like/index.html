		<title>The day after: what 9/12/2001 was like</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>The day after: what 9/12/2001 was like</h1> 
		<p>I wrote this for a now defunct mailing list on the day after 9/11. It seems reasonable to post it now, to remember what happened in a way that doesn&#39;t focus on the event, but rather how much things have changed since then.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Saul and I went swimming today at the Y. The big pool was full of kids&#0160;taking lessons, and the little pool had 3 parents and their kids splashing&#0160;and kicking and in Saul&#39;s case swallowing a bit of water. The radio was&#0160;on rather loud in the lifeguard&#39;s office, with what sounded like NPR news&#0160;going. Earlier in the day we went to farmer&#39;s market - it&#39;s nearing the&#0160;end of the peach season, but there are peppers in abundance, and plenty of&#0160;tomatoes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely starting to be fall here, with leaves turning red on at&#0160;least one tree on my regular path downtown. [...]<br /><br />A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day. On&#0160;Labor Day there had been a low-flying small plane trailing an advertising&#0160;banner for a bank (I won&#39;t bank there, now) but nothing like that today.&#0160;Totally clear blue skies and no jet contrails like normal.<br /><br />By 11 am there were no copies of the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, or&#0160;even USA Today to be had from vending machines or from Borders.<br /><br />My immediate family is checking in, and everyone is accounted for.&#0160;I have three cousins in New York City, and my parents are visiting&#0160;my brother and sister-in-law in DC. There are stories to tell but<br />not now, I am not ready for that quite yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uPhJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5R0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1304%2C767102" target="_self">Big rally on the Diag last night, something like 15,000 people were there</a>,&#0160;the&#0160;coverage from the student newspaper. We were putting Saul to bed at the&#0160;time.<br /><br />I spent far too much of Tuesday glued to the net, the radio, and to my&#0160;phone, and then late at night I finally hauled up our TV from the basement&#0160;and looked at some pictures.<br /><br />It&#39;s late now, and I don&#39;t really have a lot more to say. I would like to&#0160;hear what you are doing. I know that not everything is all right, but&#0160;even a few words about what your day is like, the sights and sounds around&#0160;you, would be nice to hear.<br /><br />For those of you who lost friends and loved ones yesterday, my&#0160;thoughts are with you.<br /><br /></p>
