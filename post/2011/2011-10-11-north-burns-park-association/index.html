		<title>North Burns Park Association fall 2011 meeting at Ann Arbor Friends Meeting House</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>North Burns Park Association fall 2011 meeting at Ann Arbor Friends Meeting House</h1> 
		<p>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.</p>
<p>The organization announced its new web site, <a href="http://northburnspark.org" target="_self">northburnspark.org</a> , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</p>
<p>Residents expressed their concerns about municipal and neighborhood issues to each other and to several area elected officials who are residents of the neighborhood, including Mayor John Hieftje, Councilman Christopher Taylor, Washtenaw County commissioner Yousef Rabhi, and the recently appointed city administrator Steve Powers. (Does Steve live in the neighborhood?) (Links to names?)</p>
<p>Noise was a concern shared by several citizens, who expressed their frustration that nearby religious services, University functions, special events and construction activity generated noise far beyond ordinary noise limits yet were exempted by permits or the University&#39;s special relationship as an autonomous body. (Link to noise articles?) (mention Big House run by name?)</p>
<p>Mayor John Hieftje addressed citizen concerns regarding crime, noting that overall crime statistics as measured according to the FBI&#39;s standard reporting criteria are down across the board. Hieftje was critical of the media&#39;s portrayal of crime issues and perceptions of crime. It was noted (by whom?) that the increased awareness of near-campus crime was due in part to the University&#39;s direct dissemination of crime information and alerts. (Explain the Cleary Act? Link to municipal maps?)</p>
<p>Residents in North Burns Park (who, specifically?) expressed specific concerns about parking in near-campus apartments, noting that landlords have converted back yards into parking lots in excess of the city standard of 4 on-site spaces for a (which, specifically?) apartment unit.&#0160;</p>
<p>(Who? A couple of petanque enthusiasts) described the courts which they had helped in getting installed at the northeast corner of Burns Park (on some date) and invited neighbors to join in their enthusiasm for the game. Petanque is a French game similar to (boules) or bocce, played with metal balls on a gravel court. Students at Burns Park Elementary School learn petanque as part of their PE classes, and (the couple) are looking forward to a June 2012 event to raise money for ALS (as part of A2A3).</p>
<p>Long term residents were happy to see each other again at this annual meeting event, and new residents were welcomed. About (how many, 35?) were in attendance. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 pm and residents ate some but not all of the cider and cookies provided before walking home.</p>
