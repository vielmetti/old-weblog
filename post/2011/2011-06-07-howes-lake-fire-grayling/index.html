<p>Mary Detloff, spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources, says weather maps from the National Weather Service show there was a strike in the area Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s our theory that a jack pine was struck that night, or some time on Monday, and probably smoldered until winds picked up on Tuesday, which caused the fire to spread,&quot; she says.</p>

<hr />
<p>A portion of the jack pine forest is on fire near <span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Grayling, MI</span>. Generally, fires of a substantial size get a name; this one is the Howes Lake Wildfire. The reporting started before the name was established so initial reports did not always use consistent naming, and I started with the &#0160;&quot;Howes Lake Fire&quot; name since it was the first name in shared use.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s details from reliable news sources that are likely to continue to have good information, updated at 12:30 am Wednesday.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://michigan.gov/dnr" target="_self">Michigan DNR</a> is sending reports out on Twitter via the <a href="http://twitter.com/michigandnr" target="_self">@MichiganDNR</a>&#0160;account. They started out are using the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23wildfire" target="_self">#wildfire</a>; following that&#0160;will also pick up coverage of the (much larger) fires in Arizona. After a while the report changed to #howeslakewildfire and that&#39;s unique (and the full name of the fire).</p>

<p>The local Grayling newspaper is the <a href="http://www.crawfordcountyavalanche.com/" target="_self">Crawford County Avalanche</a>; its story here is from 5:25 pm, <a href="http://www.crawfordcountyavalanche.com/articles/2011/06/07/latest_news/doc4dee9741dce4e920518926.txt" target="_self">Wildfire starts west of Grayling</a>. Characteristically it gives a newspapery feel to the story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Crawford County Emergency Management Department reported that a wildfire started Tuesday afternoon and is burning&#0160;&#0160; near Camp Shawono on Howes Lake Road.&#0160; The Grayling Fire Department, Kalkaska Fire Department and Frederic Fire Department were all on scene to battle the blaze.&#0160; The fire is going in a northwesterly direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Camp Shawono is the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dhs/0,1607,7-124-5452_34044_34049-109166--,00.html" target="_self">Shawono Center</a>, managed by the Michigan Department of Human Services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Shawono Center is a secure treatment facility for male juveniles between the ages of 12 and 21 years who have been adjudicated for one or more felony counts. The Center offers 3 specialized treatment programs. The Sex Offenders program has 20 beds and limits the contact with the other treatment groups. The addictions/Substance Abuse Treatment group and the general delinquents treatment group, with mild to medium mental health issues, each have 9 treatment beds.</p>
