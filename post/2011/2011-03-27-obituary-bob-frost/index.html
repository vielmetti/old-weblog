	</head>

		<h1>Obituary: Bob Frost (1952-2011), U of Michigan School of Information professor and great-grandson of poet Robert Frost</h1> 
		<p><p><strong>Robert L. &quot;Bob&quot; Frost</strong> (1952 - March 2011) was a professor at the <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu" target="_self">University of Michigan School of Information</a>. He&#0160;received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983 and joined the University of Michigan faculty in 2000. Frost was the great-grandson of poet <a href="http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu/misc/poet.html" target="_self">Robert Frost</a>, and established the&#0160;<a href="http://www.umich.info/about-SI/news-detail.htm?NewsItemID=571" target="_self">Frost Open Access Fund</a>&#0160;with royalties from his great-grandfather&#39;s works to&#0160;support faculty and student projects related to open access to information. He is survived by his wife&#0160;Margaret Hedstrom; relations, colleagues, current and former students and many friends. Donations may go to the American Cancer Society via <a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost" target="_self">Team Frost</a>. Additional details are pending.</p>
<p>There will be a memorial service for Bob Frost held on <strong>Friday, April 15 at 3:00 p.m.</strong> at the Michigan Union Ballroom in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Frost was interviewed for Michigan Today in Winter of 1996, in a story published under the title <a href="http://michigantoday.umich.edu/96/Win96/mta4w96.html" target="_self">Robert Frost&#39;s great-grandson is not a big fan of the poetry</a>.</p>
<p>A number of Bob&#39;s friends, colleagues and students have written in memoriam, collected in small part here.</p>
<p>Mark Matienzo: <a href="http://thesecretmirror.com/blog/2011/03/27/in-memoriam-bob-frost/" target="_self">In memoriam</a>. &quot;Most importantly, he was a faculty member in a huge and ever-growing graduate program who seemed to enjoy nearly every interaction he had with a student, and encouraged us to reach out to him to send him links to &quot;cool stuff&quot; on the Web that might interest him.&quot;</p>
<p>University of Michigan School of Information Dean Jeffrey Mackie-Mason announced his death with this message, which was circulated widely and is reproduced here.</p>
<blockquote>Date: Sat, Mar 26, 2011 at 11:49 PM</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dear friends, students, colleagues</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is with deep personal sadness that I write to tell you that Bob Frost has passed away. He expired while resting at home, with his wife &ndash; our colleague Margaret Hedstrom &ndash; and family members by his side. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>As many of you know, because Bob was a delightfully transparent and honest person, he has been fighting cancer for nearly two-and-a-half years. &#0160;He had remarkable courage, and fortitude (the initial prognosis was that he had less than a year to live). Bob was passionate about teaching, about his students, and about our School. &#0160;He insisted on continuing to teach a full load, and even developed new courses during his illness. &#0160;Remarkably, he was still in the classroom teaching SI 500 less than three weeks ago. &#0160;Many generations of undergraduate and graduate students have been touched by Bob; many of them say that he had a transformative impact on their choice of major and career. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was born in 1952, and received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983. He came to Michigan as a visiting associate professor of history in 1995, and joined the SI faculty in 2000. For more information about his many publications, his teaching and his other interests, see&#0160;<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/</a></a>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bob was passionate about many things, including a passion for sharing information for the good of all. &#0160;Bob and Margaret established the Frost Open Access Fund by donating the royalties that Bob receives from the works of his great-grandfather, poet Robert Frost. &#0160;The fund was also named to honor Bob&#39;s friend and colleague Olivia Frost, SI&#39;s former interim dean and professor emerita. &#0160;The Frost Fund supports innovative projects that utilize open source software, or that study or promote the open access movement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have known Bob since shortly after he arrived in Ann Arbor, and over the years was proud to become his friend. &#0160;His death is a great loss to me, and I know it is to many of you as well; I share my sympathy with all of you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A number of activities are planned to help us address our grief, and to remember Bob. &#0160;One is a fundraiser for cancer research that his students started a week ago in honor of Bob&#39;s battle: if you wish, you may contribute through the American Cancer Society at&#0160;<a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost" target="_blank"><a href="http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost">http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost</a></a>. &#0160;We will announce details of other activities soon. &#0160;</blockquote>
<blockquote>For now, please join me in a moment of silent reflection in Bob&#39;s honor. &#0160;And please join me in extending support and sympathy to Bob&#39;s loving wife, and our friend and colleague, Margaret Hedstrom.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jeff</blockquote></p>
