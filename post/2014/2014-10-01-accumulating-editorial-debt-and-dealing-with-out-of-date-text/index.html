      <p><strong>Editorial debt</strong> accumulates when the passage of time makes a document
less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited
to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.</p>

<p>For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many
ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps
in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which
can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself
out. A proper self-contained story will be true in its time, even
if the story so far is incomplete.</p>

<p>For slow-moving stories that you want to keep accurate over time,
you write things that pretend to be timeless but that are no longer
true. Details too small to warrant a complete rewrite of the narrative
are now wrong, and the text needs minor but significant edits to
reflect current reality.</p>

<p>A similar concept is bit-rot, the notion that software degrades
over time and no longer works as well as when it was released.
That can occur as a result of changes in the operating system,
changes in the working environment, adaptations by users and
appropriation of features that were not completely thought through,
or just changes in fashion.</p>

<p>How to mark things that are signs of editorial debt to come?
Words like "now" are dangerous, or "currently"; the page does
not know when that time is past. It would be better to explicitly date the
elements that are tied to time, so that you can instead say
"in October 2014", which will always be true even if circumstances 
change later.</p>

<p>What results can be a patchwork of text that tries to be
universal but that always looks dated. Balancing the narrative
with "it used to be this way but now it's this way" versus
deleting the old obsolete text and just starting fresh, now
there's a challenge.</p>

<p>Wiki is really bad for accumulating editorial debt. Text written
in an encyclopedic style really wants to be true, and not just
a snapshot in time of one of many possible states along the
evolution of an idea. Consider a timeline as an editorial structure
that puts the age of the idea primary in the narrative, so that
it's clear when the idea that you had needs to be revisited.</p>

<p>Compare with "technical debt", used to describe code that needs to
be cleaned up that drags down progress.</p>
