		<h3>19 November 2014</h3>
		<h1>When I don&#39;t write it down to share with the world I don&#39;t learn it</h1> 
		<p>I'm working on a project that will remain nameless. The sponsor of the
project asked me not to write about it, and I agreed. I'm spending a lot
of time communicating about the project, but those communications are
all private. It's intensely frustrating.</p>

<p>I learn best by writing about what I'm doing, in enough detail to capture
some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening.
There's no better way for me to learn - and to teach - than by documenting
the bits and pieces as I go, while they are still fresh. I write in a form
that's framed so that the pieces which are sharable are shared widely,
and if there's anything private that gets edited out. I've learned to do this
over time, and when it works, it works well.</p>

<p>When you write things down for the world to see, such as in this weblog or
carefully for Twitter, you get the benefit of fast feedback. People can see
what you are interested in, and you can reach out to them with something
relevant on the front page of what they see when they look for you. If there
are questions that are top of mind they can go to the top of the page. It's
a very effective way to take advantage of introductions, and to reach out
beyond people you know.</p>

<p>Without the ability to write things down it's easy to flounder. You end up
reviewing ground that you had gone over before because you forgot it, and
didn't write it down somewhere you could find it. Decisions that were made
and observations that were agreed on get revisited sometimes endlessly because
there's no contemporaneous record of the conclusion. Obscure details that
you want to follow up on later get wiped out. </p>

<p>This particular project has an internal communications tool, which will also
remain nameless. It's a stylized, formalized, cartoonish caricature of what
people actually use in real life, and it's designed to maximize management
visibility into the process rather than the utility of the process to the goal.
In many ways it reminds me of other systems I've been forced into where the
sole measure of progress was the easiest thing to measure, and all of your
hard qualitative work gets squeezed down into a single number (number of 
transactions, queue depth) that bears very little resemblance to anything useful.</p>

<p>I've written before about systems and why they fail; that's actually part of
my 140 character Twitter biography. Here the failures probably are on my part,
for not understanding the project expectations before starting, and not being
able to exit gracefully before the effort is over. The whole effort has given
me a sour taste. Most importantly, I understand sadly that being asked not to
write has been to cut off the most important part of what I can contribute to
an effort, and in retrospect I should have walked out of the room when that happened.</p>
