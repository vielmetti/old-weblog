		<title>Answers from CTN regarding City of Ann Arbor closed captioning</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>2 October 2014</h3>
		<h1>Answers from CTN regarding City of Ann Arbor closed captioning</h1> 
		<p>Answers to questions sent to Greg McDonald, CTN manager, regarding closed captioning at on City of Ann Arbor's Community Television Network.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you providing closed captioning?</strong></p>

<p>The Commission on Disability Issues made a request to add captions to their meetings to increase meeting accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Who is providing the closed captioning for CTN?</strong></p>

<p>ScreenLine, L.L.C.</p>

<p><strong>How much is the size of the contract, and for how long does it run?</strong></p>

<p>We do not have a contract with the company, we’re in a trial period and they’ll be invoicing us each time we use their service.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the individuals who are doing the closed captioning based? Are they on-site, or off-site?</strong></p>

<p>Off-site, based in Grand Ledge, Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>When was the decision made to add closed captioning to the Disability Commission?</strong></p>

<p>The Disability Commission request for closed caption services was approved as part of the FY2015 budget discussion at the Feb. 25, 2014 Cable Commission meeting.  </p>

<p><strong>Are there considerations of adding closed captioning for City Council meetings?</strong></p>

<p>Funding would have to be identified in order for closed captioning services to be provided for City Council or other Board and Commission meetings cablecast by CTN.  </p>

<p><strong>What has changed about the technology to make closed captioning feasible now when it wasn't before?</strong></p>

<p>The technology/equipment has improved and is a little less expensive today than when last researched in 2008. The closed caption service costs are about the same. The May 27, 2014 Cable Commission meeting includes (about 6:30 minute mark) discussion about the service and equipment  <a href="http://a2govtv.pegcentral.com/player.php?video=507268f61855facce4fbff749ad0ad94">video</a></p>

<p><strong>Are the transcripts from the closed captioning available as well?</strong></p>

<p>We have no transcripts from the closed captions.</p>

<p><strong>One last question: what does one hour of closed-captioned video cost, under your current arrangement with Screenline? Is there a list price, and did we get a discount? I listened to the Cable Commission discussion you linked to (thanks for that) but was no wiser as to the hourly rate from that discussion.</strong></p>

<p>The cost is $100/hr and each meeting will require a minimum of 1hr of set-up/prep time but that could vary/increase depending upon the agenda.  As far as I know, we have not been given a discount, however ScreenLine has been very helpful as we were getting the technical part of the system set-up and did not charge us for any of their time during that.</p>
