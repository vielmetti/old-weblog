		<title>Ann Arbor City Council meeting preview for Monday, 18 November 2013</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>Ann Arbor City Council meeting preview for Monday, 18 November 2013</h1> 
		<p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=222614&amp;GUID=3890EFBC-18C0-4B89-A44B-B72A3143DAD5&amp;Options=info|&amp;Search=">meeting agenda</a> for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.</p>

<p>As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/13/nov-18-2013-ann-arbor-city-council-preview/">Ann Arbor Chronicle preview</a>. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/11/repeal_of_ann_arbors_controver.html">Ann Arbor News story</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.m. it's not on the agenda, but Ann Arbor News reporter Ryan Stanton suggests on twitter that the disposition of the Old Y Lot may make it onto the agenda tonight, with council asked to accept the Dahlmann bid. 5:05 p.m. Now on the PDF agenda as "DC-4 13-1467 Resolution to Approve Sale of City-Owned Property at 350 S. Fifth to Dennis A. Dahlmann (8 Votes Required)".</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Word is that Dennis Dahlmann has accepted all of the city&#39;s terms and Y Lot sales agreement could be voted on tonight <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a2council&amp;src=hash">#a2council</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Stanton (@ryanjstanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjstanton/statuses/402543766415757312">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This will be the first meeting for new City Council member Jack Eaton, who defeated Twenty Pound Carp in the general election in November 2013.</p>

<p>Council will appoint a Mayor Pro Tem, to serve as acting Mayor when there is no mayor available. Traditionally this has gone to the most senior member of council by tenure, and I think that might be Margie Teall; the Chronicle hints that Jane Lumm might have the nod.</p>

<p>MC-1 Mayoral appointments look uncontroversial.</p>

<p>PH-1, B-1 "Pizza in the park", a waiver of fees for parks activities that provide basic human services, looks like it's likely to pass based on last week's discussion.</p>

<p>PH-2, B-2 "DDA Revisions" is probably going to take a long time, as various members of council try to make political points regarding the relative balance of services between the downtown and the neighborhoods. Make popcorn.</p>

<p>CA-1 "The Puck Drops Here" is a 31 December 2013 event (details?) to be held just before the 1 January 2014 Winter Classic NHL hockey game.</p>

<p>CA-2 "Hockey is just like football" as far as parking restrictions and street closings goes.</p>

<p>CA-3 Dawn Farm has agreed to acquire 618 N. Main from Avalon Housing.</p>

<p>DC-1 "Ypsi Township on AAATA board" Council gets to decide whether Ypsilanti Township has a seat on the AAATA transit authority board. It was a matter of controversy when it came up the first time; keep up with the popcorn.</p>

<p>DC-4 "Dahlmann proposal for Old Y Lot" This showed up on the agenda at the last possible moment, to the point where it's not clear that members of council will get a chance to read it before voting on it; certainly no one had a chance to put their name in for public commentary on this item. I'm hopeful that this resolution will be postponed until next time for a vote.</p>

<p>DS-2, DS-3, DS-4 Easement swaps with the University of Michigan for a new conduit through the Arboretum, and a new survey to settle a disputed boundary between the city and the university. </p>

<p>G-1. The Greenbelt Advisory Commission has minutes to approve from 2011 (!!!).</p>

<p>G-2. The Public Art Commission has minutes to approve from January and Feburary 2012 (!!!)</p>

<p>G-6, G-7, G-8, G-9 The Taxicab board has been very slow to produce minutes; these date back to January 2013.</p>

<p>Not on the agenda yet is a possible purchase agreement for the "Old Y Lot".</p>
