		<title>threequel === threequal - of movies, code, and the l33t</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>19 May 2008</h3>
		<h1>threequel === threequal - of movies, code, and the l33t</h1> 
		<p>A few definitions for you, with citations from the wild; spelling is as in the original with Google counts of occurences, if possible.</p>

<p>In short: threequel and 3quel are about movies; threequal is the "===" operator; 3qual is hacker speak.  More or less.</p>

<h3>threequel (33,900):</h3>

<p>When I was a kid, I assumed all third installments in a horror series had to capitalize on the ability to turn the “3″ in the title into “3-D.” Now, looking back, I only really remember (and can only find proof of) Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th 3-D and Amityville 3-D. But that isn’t stopping me from assuming Hollywood will once again abuse the gimmick.  </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.spout.com/2008/02/27/hollywood-steps-up-to-the-3d-threequel/"><br />
"Hollywood steps up to the 3-D Threequel", SpoutBlog </a> 2008</p>

<p>Spider-Man 3. Shrek 3. Pirates of the Caribbean 3. When did third-installment movies make a comeback? There's already a special multiplex in Hell that shows only Lethal Weapon 3, Beverly Hills Cop 3, and Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College. Below, we evaluate the lasting contributions of other classically bad "threequels."  </p>

<h3>threequal (1,540):</h3>

<p>The operator === is unique to Ruby (as far as I am aware). The common name for it is the case equality operator because it is used implicitly by case statements. But this is slightly misleading, as I said earlier, because it is not really "equality" at all. In this book, I often use the term relationship operator. I did not invent this term, but I can't find its origin, and it is not in common use today. The "hip and trendy" name for this is the threequal operator ("three equals").  </p>

<p><a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/0768667208/ch01lev1sec6">_The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming_, Second Edition. </a></p>

<p>Every class typically has a "threequal" operator === defined. The expression class === instance will be true if the instance belongs to the class. The relationship operator is usually known as the case equality operator because it is used implicitly in a case statement. This is therefore a way to act on the class of an expression.  </p>

<p>_The Ruby Way_</p>

<p>So (1..5) === 3 is true because 3 is in that range, but 3 isn't equal to that range, so 3 === (1..5) doesn't return true. Logical enough. If you're wondering how you're supposed to remember all this, you aren't. You don't really even need to know it. The === method exists for controlling how a case/when block will evaluate an object. It should never be used by humans. It is code written to be consumed by other code, specifically, by case and when.</p>

<h3>3quel (1,200):</h3>

<p>In its pre-TV glory days, Hollywood made a few series--Andy Hardy, The Thin Man, the Bob Hope-- Bing Crosby Road comedies, and horror films with the whole Frankenstein family. But these were middling fare. The big-ticket items were singular sensations. Nobody made a sequel to Gone With the Wind, Casablanca or Ben-Hur. The industry didn't think in roman numerals until The Godfather, Part II in 1974. But with the triumph of special-effects fantasies like Star Wars, sequels became a smart way to print money. Now they are needed to turn bad years into good ones. The difference between the box-office slump of 2005 and the rebound last year can be attributed to one film: Pirates 2. That's why the trifecta of threequels is crucial to Hollywood's health.</p>

<h3>=== (7,220,000 in Google Code Search; unsearchable in Google)</h3>

<p>Suppose though that we don't want to allow a string containing a three to match with a number three. Let's add another equals.</p>

<p>if (x === y + z) {alert('true');}</p>

<p>This still does a comparison between x and the result of adding y and z but now no conversion of numbers into strings (in fact no type conversions at all) is permitted when doing the actual comparison. Now the values being compared must be of the same data type as well as have the same value. A string containing a three is not of the same type as a number containing a three and so the comparison evaluates as false.</p>
