      <p>yes, yes, yes, just let me in.&nbsp; now what exactly did I agree to?</p>

<p>=Terms of Use=</p>

<p>*Lotsa Helping Hands, LLC* (&quot;Lotsa Helping Hands&quot;) welcomes you to its web site<br />(the &quot;web site&quot;). On this web site, Lotsa Helping Hands makes available to you<br />its Internet service for helping others along with information, software,<br />documents, communications, files, text, graphics, publications, content, tools,<br />forums, resources and links to other web sites. </p>

<p>the particular bizarre clause is</p>

<p>IN ADDITION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE, LOTSA HELPING HANDS AND ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS AND SPONSORS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT.</p>

<p>The &quot;quiet enjoyment&quot; clause refers roughly to your right to live in an apartment undisturbed; I have no clue what it's doing inside an online services agreement.</p>

<p><a href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/9614/Quiet-Enjoyment.html">Quiet Enjoyment</a></p>

<p>(more after the jump)</p>

<p>
==Privacy Policy==</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands respects your desire for privacy. Your information may be<br />
stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Lotsa<br />
Helping Hands or Lotsa Helping Hands representatives and affiliates maintain<br />
facilities. This information is highly protected and is stored in a secure and<br />
controlled environment. By using this site, you consent to any such transfer of<br />
information outside of your country and you consent to the terms of our Privacy<br />
Policy. Lotsa Helping Hands abides by the principles set forth in the Safe<br />
Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the<br />
collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. </p>

<p>
==How Lotsa Helping Hands will protect your personal information==</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands will always protect the personal information that you share<br />
with us. Lotsa Helping Hands stores information internally in a controlled,<br />
secure environment.</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands requests general demographic information in the sign-up<br />
process. This information is limited to reporting purposes only. Phone numbers,<br />
email addresses, and postal addresses are not shared for demographic reports<br />
with outside entities. If you join a community that was created from the web<br />
site service of one of our Partner organizations, the Partner's name is<br />
prominently displayed on each page of the web site. In such case, we may share<br />
your name and email address with that Partner only, and the Partner may<br />
communicate with you about activities associated only with it, but you will have<br />
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving further communications from the Partner<br />
if you wish.</p>

<p>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose<br />
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief<br />
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a<br />
court order or legal process served on our web site. </p>

<p>
==Acceptance of Terms==</p>

<p>

time without notice to you. Please check these Terms of Use for changes. Your<br />
continued use of this web site following the posting of changes to the Terms of<br />
Use will mean you accept those changes. </p>

Helping Hands, its subsidiaries, affiliated companies and/or third-party<br />

As a condition of your use of the web site, you will not use the web site for<br />

access to services, materials, other accounts, computer systems or networks<br />

<p>
==Use of Services on the Web Site==</p>

<p>
The web site provides its users (called members) access to a private community,<br />
created by the coordinator, designed to provide for communication amongst the<br />
members of the community. The web site may contain email services, communities,<br />
calendars, news groups, forums, and/or other message or communication facilities<br />
designed to enable you to communicate with others within your community (each a<br />

use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and<br />
material that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular<br />

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands reserves the right at all times to disclose any information<br />

to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in Lotsa Helping<br />
Hands' sole discretion. </p>

<p>
Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about<br />
yourself or your children in any Communication Services. Lotsa Helping Hands<br />
does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any<br />

disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any<br />
actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Services.<br />
Coordinators and members are not authorized Lotsa Helping Hands spokespersons,<br />
and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Lotsa Helping Hands. </p>

<p>
==Spam Email and Postings==</p>

<p>
You agree that Lotsa Helping Hands would be irreparably harmed by the use, by<br />
you or others, of the web site or facilities in connection with the transmission<br />
of spam newsgroup postings or unsolicited email in violation of these Terms of<br />
Use, and that Lotsa Helping Hands is entitled to obtain injunctive relief<br />
against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at<br />
law or in equity). Lotsa Helping Hands reserves the right to block, filter or<br />
delete unsolicited email. </p>

<p>

<p>
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Lotsa Helping Hands, and its<br />
subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders, partners, and<br />
employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys'<br />
fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your submissions, your<br />
use of the web site, including any use by your employees, your connection to the<br />

another. </p>
