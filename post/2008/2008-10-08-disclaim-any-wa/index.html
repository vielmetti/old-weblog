		<h1>DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT</h1> 
		<p>yes, yes, yes, just let me in.&nbsp; now what exactly did I agree to?</p>

<p>=Terms of Use=</p>

<p>*Lotsa Helping Hands, LLC* (&quot;Lotsa Helping Hands&quot;) welcomes you to its web site<br />(the &quot;web site&quot;). On this web site, Lotsa Helping Hands makes available to you<br />its Internet service for helping others along with information, software,<br />documents, communications, files, text, graphics, publications, content, tools,<br />forums, resources and links to other web sites. </p>

<p>the particular bizarre clause is</p>

<p>IN ADDITION, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE, LOTSA HELPING HANDS AND ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS AND SPONSORS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT.</p>

<p>The &quot;quiet enjoyment&quot; clause refers roughly to your right to live in an apartment undisturbed; I have no clue what it's doing inside an online services agreement.</p>

<p><a href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/9614/Quiet-Enjoyment.html">Quiet Enjoyment</a></p>

<p>(more after the jump)</p>

<p>
==Privacy Policy==</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands respects your desire for privacy. Your information may be<br />
stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Lotsa<br />
Helping Hands or Lotsa Helping Hands representatives and affiliates maintain<br />
facilities. This information is highly protected and is stored in a secure and<br />
controlled environment. By using this site, you consent to any such transfer of<br />
information outside of your country and you consent to the terms of our Privacy<br />
Policy. Lotsa Helping Hands abides by the principles set forth in the Safe<br />
Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the<br />
collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. </p>

<p>
==How Lotsa Helping Hands will protect your personal information==</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands will always protect the personal information that you share<br />
with us. Lotsa Helping Hands stores information internally in a controlled,<br />
secure environment.</p>

<p>
Lotsa Helping Hands requests general demographic information in the sign-up<br />
process. This information is limited to reporting purposes only. Phone numbers,<br />
email addresses, and postal addresses are not shared for demographic reports<br />
with outside entities. If you join a community that was created from the web<br />
site service of one of our Partner organizations, the Partner's name is<br />
prominently displayed on each page of the web site. In such case, we may share<br />
your name and email address with that Partner only, and the Partner may<br />
communicate with you about activities associated only with it, but you will have<br />
the opportunity to opt-out of receiving further communications from the Partner<br />
if you wish.</p>

<p>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose<br />
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief<br />
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a<br />
court order or legal process served on our web site. </p>

<p>
