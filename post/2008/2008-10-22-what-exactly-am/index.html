      <p>outside.in is a blog aggregator; it scoops up posts from around the net, codes them by geography, and then presents you the reader with a feed that's local to whatever you want it to be local about.&nbsp; <a href="http://outside.in/Ann_Arbor_MI">Here is the outside.in Ann Arbor page</a> .&nbsp; I get their newsletter sent to me which ends up being a good day's local news clippings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.outside.in/2008/10/21/dept-of-blogiology-101-ann-arbor/">Here's their roundup of top Ann Arbor blogs and bloggers; Vacuum is listed as a top local blog. </a> They describe what I write about as follows:</p><blockquote><p><a target="_blank" href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/">Vacuum </a>-
A love of the neighborhood library and awareness of local school news,
political happenings, tech updates and the occasional recipe make this
eclectic blog a must read. </p></blockquote><p>It's always interesting to figure out what other people thing you are doing - if you are trying to maintain a laser-like coherent focus on being eclectic, it's hard to know what to do next.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm happy that recipes make for good filler.</p>

<p>To give credit where credit is due, here's perhaps better sources for any of the components that go into this effort:</p>

<p>Libraries: my main library blog is <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron">Superpatron</a> which spun out of Vacuum about two years ago.&nbsp; Locally the <a href="http://aadl.org">Ann Arbor District Library</a> site has a bunch of blogs inside it including <a href="http://www.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/302">a good one on local history</a>, Globally my short list for library inspiration includes <a href="http://www.theshiftedlibrarian.com/">Jenny Levine's The Shifted Librarian</a>, <a href="http://tametheweb.com/">Michael Stephens writing Tame The Web</a>, and <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/">self-described library geek John Blyberg's eponymous blog.</a></p>

<p>Local school news: the <a href="http://www.burnsparkpto.org/">Burns Park Elementary PTO has a web site and newsletter</a>&nbsp; which I clip from regularly (mostly, it seems, to remind myself of things in the future).&nbsp; The <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/">Ann Arbor Chronicle</a> has good coverage of school meetings which I am never ever likely to attend regularly.&nbsp; The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arborparents">very busy arborparents mailing list </a>connects parents across town and across the area - more news than I can readily absorb but always something of interest and a very helpful bunch for asking questions of.</p>

<p>Political happenings:&nbsp; I think the outside.in people were keyed on to my elections coverage; rather than take any kind of political stance visibly here at all in any tedious partisan way, I try to always collect <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-michi.html">as much details as I can on elections including sample ballots and polling place locations and times.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;The best sources for that are <a href="http://potifos.com/polygon/">county clerk Larry Kestenbaum's occasional blogging</a>, plus a certain degree of digging through municipal web sites.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/services/Pages/E-mailAlertSubscription.aspx">City of Ann Arbor's email alert service</a> helps a lot.</p>

<p>Tech updates: This leaves broad room for interpretation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the useful but sometimes tedious realm, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme is the only tech news tracker you need to listen to the silicon valley echo chamber</a>.&nbsp; Collecting more local tech news is helped by<a href="http://concentratemedia.com/"> Issue Media Group's Concentrate</a> and by <a href="http://www.wwj.com/pages/317228.php">Matt Roush's Great Lakes IT Report</a>, both of which are eager to write about local stuff.&nbsp; My <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 weekly lunch group and the mailing list that goes with it</a> are my local collection source for interesting people and projects and tech (and note that quite a bit of this is pre-market projects not yet in the Silicon Valley radar).</p>

<p>The occasional recipe: The relentlessly practical answer to how this gets done is &quot;blog what you eat&quot;; if you are persistent about that, you get ready-made menu plans for next year around the same time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, I turn to <a href="http://4obsessions.blogspot.com">Kate Remen-Wait's Four Obsessions blog</a> when I need a menu idea,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitchenchick.com">Kitchenchick for reviews of local restaurants</a>, and <a href="http://www.thefarmersmarketer.com/">The Farmer's Marketer for a market list from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market</a>.&nbsp; Globally the technique is &quot;google cooking&quot; or &quot;twitter cooking&quot; where you simply type in a list of ingredients into either search box and hope someone has something inspiring. </p>

<p>Eclectica.&nbsp; It's imporant to be fed a steady diet of things which are interesting; if <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/09/creativity_is_a.html">creativity is an import-export game</a>, then this is the import side of that.&nbsp; Reliably I pull from<a href="http://delicious.com/network/vielmetti"> my network on delicious</a> for great weird ideas.&nbsp; There are a few weblogs that specialize in the eclectic, most notably <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/bifurcated/rivets/">Lindsay Marshall's Bifurcated Rivets: A Compendium of Eclectica for Epopts.</a></p>

<p>so there you go.</p>
