		<title>mechanical blueberry harvesters</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>24 June 2008</h3>
		<h1>mechanical blueberry harvesters</h1> 
		<p>If you're serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation.  Here's an example of a <a href="http://www.dbe.ca/blueberryharvester.htm">blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia</a></p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels. This rotation is at a speed in ratio to the forward motion of the tractor. As the comb type-picking bars rake the blueberries from the plants they are carried around the reel and deposited in a conveyor. This conveyor delivers them to another longer conveyor, which carries them to the rear three-point-hitch mounted loading platform. As the berries fall from the conveyor a blower cleans them.
</blockquote>

<p>The harvester was invented by <a href="http://www.nsac.ns.ca/halloffame/citations/bragg_douglas.htm">R. Douglas Bragg</a> (1930-1996):</p>

<blockquote>
Doug Bragg always maintained a strong interest in the blueberry industry. Not only was he a manufacturer of the patented wild blueberry harvester and a blueberry producer himself, but he was an active member of the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia. From 1979 to 1981 he served as a Director and was an active member of the Research Committee from the time of its inception until the fall of 1996. He was a Founding Director of the Nova Scotia Blueberry Institute and was instrumental in the early days of its development and building of the research field station at Debert. In 1995 Doug received the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia Award of Recognition.
</blockquote>

<p>There's a set of patents on blueberry harvesters.  Here's what US Patent <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5375403/description.html">5365403, Lowbush berry harvester</a> has to say about the Bragg patented harvester:</p>

<blockquote>
A later development is reported in Canadian Pat. No. 1,249,727 of Bragg Lumber Company. According to the patent, this harvester mounts a picking head, almost identical to the Chisholm-Ryder head, on the side of a farm tractor, but in such a manner that the picking head is "towed " by the tractor. The arrangement ostensibly accommodates variations in the ground by allowing for pitch and roll of the head during operation. As with the Chisholm-Ryder head, the tines of the Bragg harvester are controlled by a cam and cam follower arrangement. In the Bragg harvester, as the tines approach top dead centre of the reel they are caused to flap rapidly to dislodge the berries carried thereby for easy deposit on the internal conveyor.
</blockquote>

<p>On my favorite blueberry-picking grounds, there's way too many ferns, jack pines, jack pine cones, bits of lichen and moss to ever make it suited for mechanical harvesting; just as well.</p>
