		<title>Service as a service</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>29 July 2008</h3>
		<h1>Service as a service</h1> 
		<p>After a small set of discussions today with people I won't blog about, here's some ideas from people I don't know using a phrase I thought I might have made up: "service as a service".</p>

<p>James Urquhart's "The Wisdom of Clouds" on <a href="http://blog.jamesurquhart.com/2008/03/service-as-service-market-explored.html">Service as a Service Market Explored</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Real quick, David Linthicum has a cool post on the move in the market from human-oriented SaaS (Software as a Service) to systems oriented SaaS--perhaps better named "Service as a Service". The naming is a little nerdy, but David is right on about this being an ultimate goal of the SaaS market, as well as of cloud computing in general.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>chase that reference to this <a href="http://www.intelligententerprise.com/blog/archives/2008/03/when_saas_means.html">Intelligent Enterprise article on When SaaS Means 'Services as a Service' </a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
StrikeIron is the one that comes to mind. StrikeIron is not a SaaS provider, but a SaaS provider with the first S being 'Services' vs. 'Software.' They offer a variety of services, such as SMS text messaging, tax rate calculations, address validation, etc. The objective being not to provide the holistic application, but simple components that can be abstracted into enterprise and SaaS applications, as needed, for a small monthly subscription fee. Thus, you don't write it, you don't test it, you don't host it, you just leverage its functionality at a fraction of the cost if you developed the same service in-house.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>hm, perhaps a little bit too "granular" (oh I love to hate that word; coarse, Demera, what are you talking, sugar?).  Another try goes down the manufacturing route - envisioning cheap frictionless production of one-off quantities of things, in this case printed letters sent through the mail.  The <a href="http://blog.postful.com/2007/10/29/manufacturing-as-a-service-maas/">Postful blog on Manufacturing as a Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The modern service cloud ushers in a fundamental shift in our accounting of economic costs. The endemic overhead in even the most basic of deals and transactions is perhaps the key factor in determining the structure of our economic systems at all scales. The service cloud can reduce those transaction costs to negligible levels.
</blockquote>

<p>and finally perhaps this one from <a href="http://jrsays.com/2007/09/software-as-service-objectification-of.html">JR Says on the objectification of business processes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I know the term “Service-as-a-service” sounds like an idiotic reference to nothing, but my point is that business services can finally be delivered in a way which is easily acquirable by customers, as true services, with:
- clear, non-obtrusive contracts (the business kind… you know, ToS you feel no obligation to read ;)
- clear communication contracts (the implementation kind… “you give us A , we give you B”)
- pay as you go – with clear pricing
- strong support (imagine that)
</blockquote>

<p>I went to Cuil (gaelic for "fail") for the last word; it's a good one.  Via <a href="http://www.cubiccompass.com/blogs/main/PermaLink,guid,794ab498-c692-4eb4-b3c7-b02c9e0917e2.aspx">Cubic Compass</a>, quoting <a href="http://www.tcg-advisors.com/who/lay.htm">Philip Lay</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"What is likely to no longer work is the conventional time and materials model of expensive "manual" services, now seen to be highly inefficient unless enabled by increasing use of automation.  What must be made to work is to have virtually every service substantially automated and deliverable online once the service in question has been transformed from a custom, never-done-before, thing to a repeatable and relatively routine activity."
