		<h3>23 December 2008</h3>
		<h1>How I stopped worrying and learned to love Twitter: five new strategies</h1> 
		<p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;<a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html">Twitter zero</a>&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar number</a> and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; </p><p>The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again.&#0160; Less of a burden than the accumulated drag of other systems that I had given up on but that still had <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/retrenching-on-web-20-controlling-your-presence-by-turning-off-abandoned-services.html">remnant shards of a previous me</a>, but still a burden.</p><p>As of yesterday I have switched to the &quot;follow everyone who follows you&quot; strategy - as close to strict reciprocity as I can.&#0160; If someone is really awful I&#39;ll block them, but for the most part even the single-threaded marketing droids are bearable if they are mixed in with enough other people.&#0160; At noon Eastern on a Tuesday the front page of my Twitter has 17 minutes worth of stuff in it and I&#39;m about 1/3 of the way through following everyone, so at some point the balance will be &quot;wait five minutes and the front page will have completely changed&quot;.</p><p>This is quite frankly a change from any of my previous tactics and I&#39;m going to be as deliberate about it as I can.&#0160; Here&#39;s a pointless numbered list of iron-clad rules.</p><p>1.&#0160; To keep a conversation going you have to use the @ convention to refer to someone by name, or else the dialog gets lost.&#0160; Twitter stops being a small group extended chat and starts to be some extended group distributed semi-broadcast.&#0160;&#0160; Checking the &quot;replies&quot; tab becomes part of making sure that if there&#39;s a conversation that happened between sessions you can get back to it.&#0160; Every so often you get some little knot of people all online at once going back and forth at each other, but that&#39;s not what you can count on.</p><p>2.&#0160; If you have anything of lasting substance to say, refer to something already written, whether it be a blog post, a delicious tag stream, or something else that is more than 140 characters long.&#0160;&#0160; Everything is scrolling by so fast in this world that if you need to anchor a discussion it can&#39;t be anchored in more and more twitters.&#0160; Blogging becomes more important, not less, in this approach - if it doesn&#39;t fit in one line you have to refer to it somehow.</p><p>3.&#0160; If you play Twitter this way there will always be something more to look at - it&#39;s a never ending game.&#0160; So to keep the time commitment finite and bounded you need to figure out when to stop and just turn it off.&#0160;&#0160; You have to stop some time - figure out how many pages deep in the scroll back you are going to watch, and then quit.&#0160; <strong>If you keep refreshing it will never, ever stop.</strong>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p><p>4.&#0160; As a never ending game the scoring rules clearly change as you play it.&#0160; Various &quot;twitter metrics&quot; have been proposed that mostly boil down to &quot;increase the n&quot;.&#0160; If my earlier explorations are accurate, the counter-tactic of &quot;decrease the n&quot; is just as valuable - going down to zero helped me think about the system carefully.&#0160; I&#39;ve never tried to follow 800+ people before, but I guess now I&#39;ll have a chance to try.&#0160; There&#39;s a stable, winning strategy where the goal is to &quot;<strong>change the n</strong>&quot; - cycle systematically from 0 to max(n) and then back to 0, every day either turning people on or turning people off but never staying the same; the rules of that game are that at every turn you have to change the number of followers you have.</p><p>5.&#0160; People love pointless numbered lists.&#0160; Use them.</p><p>--</p><p>What you lose is the sense of a quiet place where all of your close friends from around town hang out online.&#0160;&#0160; What you gain is some broader sense of the world.&#0160; </p>
