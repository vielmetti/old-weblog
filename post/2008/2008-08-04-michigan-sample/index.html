		<h1>Michigan Sample Ballot for 2008 August 5 primary election; AutoMARK problems redux</h1> 
		<p>The primaries in Michigan are tomorrow, August 5 2008.</p>

<p>If you want a sample ballot, go to the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/vote">Michigan Voter Information Center</a> run by the Michigan Secretary of State.  You'll put in your voter information, and it will come up with a list of elections on the ballot.  <a href="http://publius.org">Publius also generates Michigan sample ballots</a>, as does the <a href="http://thevoterguide3.mlive.com/?sfr">MLive Voter Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/elections/el_precincts.html">Washtenaw County precinct locations</a> is kept by the County Clerk and Register of Deeds, Larry Kestenbaum.  He's running unopposed for re-election.  </p>

<p>I'll be voting again this year using the AUTOMARK machine set up for vision impaired voters.  My notes from last time <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/ann-arbor-may-6.html">show the problems I had with the AUTOMARK machine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Note for next time: vote early (and vote often), and tear the stub off before inserting the ballot into the AutoMARK machine, despite all of the instructions to the contrary.
</blockquote>

<p>My experience with AutoMARK is not unique - here's this season's clippings of people with problems:</p>

<p>Nassau County, NY: from the <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/NYSTEC-Finds-NY-SBOE-Votin-by-Rady-Ananda-080711-393.html">OpEd News</a> site (some political blog)<br />
<blockquote><br />
Nassau County purchased 450 ballot marking devices (BMDs) from Sequoia, at a cost of $12,000 each.  It reported that 85% of 240 machines were non-functional, one fifth of them damaged during shipment.  New York City also experienced software failure, when it tested ES&S AutoMARK's BMD, as attested at the June 23rd NYC Government Services Committee, reported Nassau County Attorney Lori Barrett.   </p>

<p>Ballot marking devices allow disabled voters to vote independently, printing the ballot for them, and would fulfill NY's compliance with the Help America Vote Act.  Yet a substantial portion of BMDs received in Nassau registered a printer failure.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>San Francisco is sold uncertified AutoMARK systems: from <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/elections_index.asp?id=70865">the San Francisco Department of Elections</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
On August 21, 2007, the Secretary of State announced a public hearing to examine ES&S's sale of uncertified AutoMARK machines to five California counties, including San Francisco.  In April 2006, San Francisco purchased 565 AutoMARKs from ES&S for $6,185.89 per machine, paying a total purchase price of nearly $3.5 million.  Unbeknownst to San Francisco at the time of the purchase, and as later reported by the Secretary of State, these 565 machines (as well as 407 AutoMARKs sold to other California counties) were uncertified.<br />
 <br />
Shortly after receiving the Secretary of State's statement, the Director of Elections confirmed that the voting machines ES&S sold San Francisco in April 2006 for use in the June 2006 and subsequent elections were the uncertified AutoMARK Model A200 machines.  But at the time of the sale, ES&S represented to San Francisco that it was providing AutoMARK Model A100 machines, which had been previously certified by the Secretary of State in August 2005, roughly seven months prior to San Francisco's purchase.  In fact, the machines ES&S provided were AutoMARK Model A200 machines, which had not been certified by the Secretary of State.  Unaware that ES&S's representations that the machines were certified were false, San Francisco unwittingly used what turned out to have been uncertified AutoMARK ballot marking machines in both the June 2006 and November 2006 elections. <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Ed Felten's Freedom to Tinker blog on <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1269">California review of the ES&S AutoMARK and M100</a>:<br />
<blockquote><br />
Yet still, they note that “We are not aware of any public device that has more flexibility in accommodating the wide range of physical and dexterity abilities that voters may have. The key, as always, is whether pollworkers and voters will be able to identify and implement the optimal input system without better guidance or expert support. In fact, it may be that the more flexible a system is, the more difficult it is for novices to navigate through the necessary choices for configuring the access options in order to arrive at the best solution.” One of their most striking findings was how long it took test subjects to use the system. Audio-only voters needed an average of almost 18 minutes to use the machine on a simplified ballot (minimum 10 minutes; maximum 35 minutes). Write-in votes were exceptionally difficult. And, again, this is arguably one of the best voting systems available, at least from an accessibility perspective.<br />

<p>Vote early (you might need the extra time!)</p>
