		<title>Interview with Dave Sommerness, GovDelivery COO</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>29 October 2008</h3>
		<h1>Interview with Dave Sommerness, GovDelivery COO</h1> 
		<p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/ann-arbor-fire.html">The City of Ann Arbor has started an email-based delivery service for changes and updates to the city&#39;s web site run by GovDelivery.</a>&#0160; I contacted Dave Sommerness, a University of Michigan graduate and their COO, to find out more.</p><p><strong>
How did your organization get started, and who was your first customer?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govdelivery.com">GovDelivery</a>, Inc. was started in 1999 by our two co-founders, CEO Scott Burns and EVP of Sales Zach Stabenow. &#0160;We developed the GovDelivery Digital Subscription Management system in 2000 in collaboration with the City of St. Paul, who had a need for reliable communication with its residents. &#0160;We found this need to be pervasive across public sector organizations, and it&#39;s taken off quite well from there.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Government web sites are built with all kinds of technologies. &#0160;How do you manage the process so that it all looks the same to the user?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We integrate with client sites by simple links on their web pages. &#0160;The effect is seamless because we customize our web and email templates to match the look-and-feel of each client. &#0160;Behind the scenes GovDelivery is deployed as a multi-tenant, SaaS system, so Ann Arbor is using the same basic application as our other clients.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
The service I signed up for was an email based one. &#0160;What are your plans for looking at web 2.0 technologies for notification, e.g. using something like Twitter to do messaging?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>We&#39;re always looking forward to new technologies and applications to our system/market. &#0160;A couple years ago we added RSS capability, so our clients can publish their messages as RSS feeds in addition to sending them out through email. &#0160;We&#39;ve seen a lot of excitement in our market over Web 2.0 technologies, so we&#39;re developing functionality to take advantage of that and promote more options for communication and collaboration between government and citizens. &#0160;A few examples of Web<br />
2.0 notification that we already support include automatically posting messages to blogs, updating a Facebook page, and using public RSS feeds to publish bulletins to widgets.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
Do you work with libraries as part of your business, and if so, can you share some good stories from those implementations?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>The majority of our experience has been with government bodies - from small cities and counties up to the largest federal departments - and transit authorities, though we have some experience with education,<br />
non-profits, and other organizations. &#0160;We work with a number of libraries, mainly through city accounts, but the most notable stand-alone library account is the Library of Congress.</p>
<div class="Ih2E3d"><br /><strong>
What makes St. Paul a good place to run this business from, and not Silicon Valley or Washington, DC?</strong><br />
<br />
</div><p>Good business is about good people, and there&#39;s a great pool of talent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. We&#39;re one of the fastest growing software companies in the area, which attracts talented people and helps us to retain and keep them challenged. &#0160;We don&#39;t have the issues that Silicon Valley has where folks are more apt to jump to the next flavor of the day. &#0160;Because of the density of clients in D.C., we do maintain a sales office and staff there, which we plan to grow as the business does.</p><p><strong>
Who do you root for when Michigan plays Minnesota?</strong></p><p>I grew up a Bulldog hockey fan in Duluth - the Gophers were big rivals, so it&#39;s been tough for me to become a fan of any of their teams. &#0160;The real dilemma for me would be if Michigan ever played UMD in hockey.</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks Dave!</p>
