		<title>Ann Arbor sign ordinances</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>21 January 2008</h3>
		<h1>Ann Arbor sign ordinances</h1> 
		<p><p>
If your neighbor erects a giant sign on their lawn, or on the side of their house, what is your recourse?
</p><p>
UPDATE: In Ann Arbor the simple and direct way to deal with this is to call the city&rsquo;s Community Standards department at <a href="callto:1-734-994-1613">734-994-1613</a>.  A neighbor who has been through this before says that they deal with sign problems promptly.
</p><p>
The appropriate part of the city code reads as follows.  NOTE: This is not the official city code site!  Find it and read it before complaining.
</p><p>
- <a href="http://www.aaabor.com/downloads/Resources/SignOrdinances/city_of_AA_Sign_ordinance.pdf">PDF from the Ann Arbor Board of Realtors</a>:
</p><p>
5:504. Residence signs.
</p><p>
(1)    <em> Single and 2-family houses. </em>Townhouses and detached single-family and duplex
<br />houses are permitted signs having a total area of 3 square feet indicating the address and
<br />names of the occupants.
<br />(2)    <em> Multiple family residences. </em>Apartment houses, fraternity houses, sorority houses,
<br />cooperative houses, retirement homes, tourist homes and religious institutions are
<br />permitted signs having a total area of 12 square feet indicating only the address, the
<br />names of the occupants and the name of the building or organization.
<br />(3)    <em> Subdivisions. </em>Subdivisions of single and 2-family homes and housing complexes of
<br />more than 1 apartment or town house building are permitted signs identifying the
<br />subdivisions or housing complex. Such signs shall have an area of not more than 50
<br />square feet and a height of not more than 8 feet. A subdivision or housing complex shall
<br />not have a total of more than 2 such signs nor more than 1 per entrance.
<br />(Ord. No. 55-74, 6-9-75; Ord. No. 33-82, 8-2-82)
</p><p>
5:505 Temporary signs.
</p><p>
Unilluminated on-premises temporary exterior signs may be erected in accordance with
<br />the regulations of this section.
<br />(1)    <em> Single and Two-Family Real Estate&ndash;For Sale Signs. </em>
<br />(a)     A single sign with a maximum height of 48 inches and a maximum width of 36
<br />inches, including the support structure and all riders, and with the bottom of the sign a
<br />minimum of 6 inches from the ground, advertising the sale of a single or two-family
<br />house or variant property adjacent to such a house is permitted.
<br />(b)     Such a sign shall be set back at least 15 feet from the street and at least 5 feet from
<br />the inside edge of the sidewalk, or in accordance with Table 5:505 when conditions do
<br />not permit such placement. Provided, that if a legally existing obstruction on the property
<br />prevents the sign from being seen from the street when the sign is placed in accordance
<br />with the foregoing placement requirements, then the sign may be affixed to or placed
<br />immediately in front of such obstruction, so long as the display face of the sign is parallel
<br />to the right-of-way line, and so long as the sign is not placed within the public right-of-
<br />way.
<br />&copy;     A sign advertising the sale of a property must be removed within 48 hours after the
<br />closing on the sale.
<br />(2)    <em> Single and Two-Family Real Estate&ndash;Rental Signs. </em>
<br />(a)     A single sign with a maximum height of 48 inches and a maximum width of 36
<br />inches, including the support structure and all riders, and with the bottom of the sign a
<br />minimum of 6 inches from the ground, advertising the rental of a single or two-family
<br />house or variant property adjacent to such a house is permitted.
<br />(b)     Such sign shall be set back at least 15 feet from the street and at least 5 feet from
<br />the inside edge of the sidewalk, or in accordance with Table 5:505 when conditions do
<br />not permit such placement. Provided, that if a legally existing obstruction on the property
<br />prevents the sign from being seen from the street when the sign is placed in accordance
<br />with the foregoing placement requirements, then the sign may be affixed to or placed
<br />immediately in front of such obstruction, so long as the display face of the sign is parallel
<br />to the right-of-way line, and so long as the sign is not placed within the public right-of-
<br />way.
<br />&copy;     A sign advertising the rental of a property must be removed within 48 hours after
<br />the property is no longer available for rent.
<br />(3)    <em> Real Estate. </em>A sign with a total area not in excess of 12 square feet advertising the
<br />sale or rental of real estate other than single or two-family houses is permitted pursuant to
<br />a permit having a maximum duration of 120 days. It shall have a maximum height of 10
<br />feet and shall be set back 25 feet unless attached to a permanent building.
