Our observations agree with previous work on small networks, but we show that large networks have a very different structure.&#0160; In particular, we observe tight communities that are barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales (up to $\approx 100$ nodes); and communities of size scale beyond $\approx 100$ nodes gradually ``blend into&#39;&#39; the expander-like core of the network and thus become less ``community-like,&#39;&#39; with a roughly inverse relationship between community size and optimal community quality. This observation agrees well with the so-called Dunbar number which gives a limit to the size of a well-functioning community.<br /></div><br /><br /><p><br />FRIDAY Dec. 5, 2008<br />

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN LARGE SOCIAL AND INFORMATION NETWORKS<br />
Michael W. Mahoney<br />
Stanford University</p><p>
The concept of a community is central to social network analysis, and
thus a large body of work has been devoted to identifying community
structure. For example, a community may be thought of as a set of web
pages on related topics, a set of people who share common interests, or
more generally as a set of nodes in a network more similar amongst
themselves than with the remainder of the network. &#0160;Motivated by
difficulties we experienced at actually finding meaningful communities
in large real-world networks, we have performed a large scale analysis
of a wide range of social and information networks. &#0160;Our main
methodology uses local spectral methods and involves computing
isoperimetric properties of the networks at various size scales -- a
novel application of ideas from scientific computation to internet data
analysis. Our empirical results suggest a significantly more refined
picture of community structure than has been appreciated previously.
Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network dataset we
examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities at very small
size scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible communities
gradually ``blend in&#39;&#39; with the rest of the network and thus become
less ``community-like.&#39;&#39; This behavior is not explained, even at a
qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation
models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one
would expect based on experience with and intuition from expander
graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional
structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds
of community detection algorithms. Possible mechanisms for reproducing
our empirical observations will be discussed, as will implications of
these findings for clustering, classification, and more general data
analysis in modern large social and information networks.</p>
