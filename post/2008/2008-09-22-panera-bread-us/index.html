		<title>Panera Bread user agreement: yeah, yeah, I agree, just let me on the net</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>22 September 2008</h3>
		<h1>Panera Bread user agreement: yeah, yeah, I agree, just let me on the net</h1> 
		<p>Panera Bread has a click agreement when you log in through their service.&nbsp; Here it is in full, in the continuation section.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of it is enforceable, especially this little gem:</p><blockquote><p>This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Panera requires that you be a good Internet citizen when using this Service.</p></blockquote><p>Panera is generally a good bet for going somewhere for a cup of coffee and internet.&nbsp; A list of Michigan locations is in the next section too.</p>

<p>This is a legal agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) between you and the owner/operator of this Panera Bread� or Saint Louis Bread Company� bakery cafe (collectively, the &quot;Panera Bakery-cafes&quot;) governing your access to and use of this WIFI SERVICE (the &quot;Service&quot;) THAT PANERA IS PROVIDING TO GUESTS LIKE YOU. ONLY CURRENT GUESTS OF THIS PANERA BAKERY-CAFE MAY USE THIS SERVICE. <br />BY CLICKING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY A GUEST OF THIS PANERA BAKERY-CAFE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THEM. If you are not a current guest of a Panera Bakery-cafe and/or you do not agree to this Agreement, you may not use or access this Service. <br />For purposes of your using this Service, Panera will assume (and by using this Service you warrant) that either you have legal capacity to enter into this Agreement (i.e., that you are of sufficient age and mental capacity or are otherwise entitled to be legally bound in contract), or that your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have consented to your use of this Service and accept this Agreement on your behalf. <br />You are agreeing to this Agreement in consideration of your use and access to this Service and other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged), for the benefit of: (i) Panera, LLC and all of its affiliates and service providers (the &quot;Panera Corporate Parties&quot;), if you are accessing this Service from a Panera, LLC owned/operated Panera Bakery-Cafe; or (ii) the franchisee-owner/operator of this Panera Bakery-cafe, as well as Panera, LLC, and all of their respective affiliates and service providers (the &quot;Panera Franchisee Parties&quot;), if you are accessing this Service from a franchisee-owned/ operated Panera Bakery- cafe. As used in this Agreement, the terms: (x) &quot;Panera&quot; means the Panera Corporate Parties (for Sites owned/operated by Panera, LLC and/or its affiliates) or the Panera Franchisee Parties (for Sites owned/operated by franchisees), as applicable; and (y) &quot;Site&quot; means the Panera Bakery-cafe location where you are accessing this Service. <br />CONSENT TO MONITORING. PANERA RESERVES THE RIGHT TO, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT THAT PANERA MAY (BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO) MONITOR YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND ACTIVITIES VIA THIS SERVICE (INCLUDING THEIR CONTENT) DURING TRANSMISSION AND IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THIS SERVICE, AND MAY DISCLOSE ANY SUCH INFORMATION FOR PURPOSES OF ENSURING YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, APPLICABLE LAW, COOPERATING WITH LEGAL AUTHORITIES, AND OTHERWISE PROTECTING PANERA'S RIGHTS, PROPERTY AND INTERESTS. <br />AUTHORIZED USE OF THIS SERVICE. You agree that you are authorized to use this Service solely while you are a guest of this Panera Bakery-cafe, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You agree that you are fully responsible for your activities while using this Service (including for any content, information and other materials you access or transmit via this Service), and that you shall bear all risks regarding use of this Service. You agree not to use this Service to engage in any prohibited conduct. Broadly stated, prohibited conduct is any conduct that is unlawful, infringing, tortious or that is harmful (or puts at risk) to Panera or any other party or property; that violates another party's intellectual property, privacy or other rights; or that otherwise interferes with the operation, use or enjoyment of any service, system or other property. <br />By way of illustration and not limitation, prohibited conduct includes using this Service to: (i) intercept, divert or otherwise interfere with any communication, (ii) violate the security or integrity of, or gain unauthorized access to, this Service or any other service, system or communication; (ii) impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on any systems or infrastructure; (iii) send &quot;spam&quot;, chain letters, or other unsolicited communications to any party; (iv) create a &quot;mail drop&quot; for such communications, or engage or permit e-mail relay services (e.g., &quot;open mail relay&quot;); (v) &quot;spoof&quot; or otherwise impersonate any other party, falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your identity or affiliation in any way, or forge, delete or alter any part of TCP/IP packet header or sender identification information in any communication; (vi) commit fraud; (vii) harass, or threaten any party, advocate or otherwise encourage violence against any government, organization, group, individual or property, or provide instruction, information, or assistance in causing or carrying out such violence; (viii) disseminate viruses, Trojan horses, or other code or programming intended to damage, interfere with, intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (ix) send or receive any material that could be considered harmful, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, violent, abusive, profane, insulting, threatening, tortious, harassing, hateful or otherwise objectionable; (x) send or receive any material that harasses, victimizes, degrades, or intimidates an individual or group of individuals on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, age, or disability; (xi) send or receive material containing defamatory, false, or libelous material; (xii) send or receive any material that infringes or violates any intellectual property or other right of any entity or person, including, without limitation, copyrights, patents, trademarks, laws governing trade secrets, rights to privacy, or publicity; (xiii) send or receive any material that you do not have a right to make available under law or contractual or fiduciary relationships; (xiv) engage in conduct that would expose Panera or its service providers to civil or criminal liability; or (xv) assist others in engaging in prohibited conduct.

Upon any termination, your rights to use this Service will immediately cease. Panera also reserves the right to update or revise this Agreement at any time without prior notice, and you agree that Panera may do so. Your continued use of this Service following an update to this Agreement signifies your acceptance of its revised terms. <br />MISCELLANEOUS. You agree that: this Agreement and your use of this Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to conflicts of laws principles, and Panera shall have at all times the right to seek any injunctive or equitable relief available to it under applicable laws.

You agree that any controversy or claim brought or asserted by you or on your behalf that arises out of or relates to this Agreement or this Service shall be solely against the owner/operator that is providing this Service to you at this Panera Bakery-cafe, and not any other party. Further, you agree that any action you bring that arises from or relates to this Service must be initiated within one year from the relevant date of your access to this Service, and that no cause of action may be brought after that time. You agree that if any provision(s) of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision(s) will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely serves the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue to have legal effect. You agree that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Panera regarding its subject matter, and it supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Panera regarding its subject matter.
