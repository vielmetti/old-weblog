		<title>Coping with community growth</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>21 August 2008</h3>
		<h1>Coping with community growth</h1> 
		<p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/a2b3">The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents</a> had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need.</p>

<p>The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you cope with community growth?&nbsp; In particular, if you have an organization that has regular meetings and it outstrips the capabilities of its venue, what do you do to keep it going?&nbsp; Some ideas.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Hold the meeting more frequently.&nbsp; If the monthly meeting is full every time, do a second event on alternate weeks.&nbsp; This is what movie theaters do with popular films (matinees, midnight films, 10a showings) or what busy religious congregations do.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Move the meeting from place to place.&nbsp; Some people will come if it's convenient enough, so if you move from place to place you'll get a variety of people attending who wouldn't otherwise because it's incrementally less convenient.&nbsp; <a href="http://motorcityconnect.collectivex.com/main/summary">Motor City Connect has ten meetings in eight cities around the Detroit area every month,</a> with the idea that it's going to be somewhere close to you some time.</p>

<p>3. Let the group subdivide laterally, with some part of the original collection of people doing something related at a different place and a different time.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microcoworking.com">The a2b3 group spawned (in some sense) the microcoworking group</a>, which started with one day and has expanded to three days at three different locations.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Raise the bar for participation, so that your community grows more slowly.&nbsp; At an extreme, you get new member initiation rituals that approach hazing, and so anyone who wants to stick around really wants to stick around; at the extreme, this coupled with no new member recruitment gives you groups that stop growing and start to grow old with the same people there every time.</p>

<p>5. Grow into different forms, e.g. take an offline group and put it online, or take an online group on one community platform and add it to another community platform.&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/a2b3">a2b3 has a very strong and functional mailing list,</a> so people don't have to be at the meetings to post a job offering or get bike repair recommendations or locate a trusted network security auditor (to give but three examples).</p>

<p>6.&nbsp; Use one group to bootstrap the creation of a new group, and then pull your energy out of the first group.&nbsp; In a religious setting this would be a <a href="http://www.joyfulheart.com/plant/splinter.htm">splinter church</a>, and just by that very name you get some sense at some possible social friction that would result.&nbsp; </p>

<p>7.&nbsp; Move your focus from local groups to national or global ones, and grow a community of practice globally rather than just locally.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?wiki_wednesdays">Wiki Wednesday meets on the first Wednesday of the month worldwide</a>; the <a href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/">Web Analytics Wednesday group</a> coordinates Wednesday meetings worldwide.&nbsp; The local meeting is probably still local, but it's part of a bigger world.</p>

<p>Some of these growth strategies yield more managable growth; others recognize that groups might just reach a happy steady state where you don't really want to multiply your size.&nbsp; </p>
