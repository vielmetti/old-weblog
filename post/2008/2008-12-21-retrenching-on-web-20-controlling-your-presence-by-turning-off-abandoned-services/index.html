		<h1>retrenching on web 2.0 - controlling your presence by turning off abandoned services</h1> 
		<p>If there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &quot;free&quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&#39;s advertising there sponsoring it.</p><p>With the retrenching in Web 2.0 properties - either sites getting bought up and closed down, abandoned by their new owners, orphaned, or mutated beyond recognition in the search for profit, it&#39;s time to start looking closely at what kinds of remnant &quot;internet presence&quot; I have lurking on the internets and see about turning off anything that&#39;s no longer relevant or up to date.&#0160; Here&#39;s a list of sorts of long-forgotten enthusiasms that should be mercifully excised or republished in some current format.</p><p>Yikes!&#0160; There&#39;s a lot of debris here.&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/">OPML blog</a> - Dave Winer&#39;s software for publishing; I used it about a dozen times between 2006 and 2008.&#0160; The sidebar is full of links to blogs that I don&#39;t read, helping boost their pagerank.&#0160; If I can get back to it, I&#39;ll nix it.</p><p><a href="http://www.superpatron.com/">superpatron.com</a> - Once upon a time I was going to move my Typepad blog for superpatron over to Wordpress; that project stopped before it really got started, leaving a half baked page up.&#0160; Redo that so that it redirects properly.</p><p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Eemv/project/vacuum/">Vacuum #8</a> - The last iteration of my Blogger based blog from 2003, after which I switched over to Typepad.&#0160; It&#39;s a relic, and I think I&#39;l keep it as a relic, in part because I used to have a functioning design that had a nice ever-growing ad hoc sidebar full of marginalia and none of the Typepad designs really support that well.</p><p><a href="http://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?edward_vielmetti">Edward Vielmetti - Socialtext Customer Exchange</a> - yikes, a wiki.&#0160; It should get a copy of the standard bio.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/edward-vielmetti/">Flickr</a> - Not many photos uploaded since my camera died a technicolor death.&#0160; My bio is about two years out of date, and it doesn&#39;t have the current picture.&#0160; I&#39;m increasingly irritated by Flickr&#39;s cutesiepie error messages, which don&#39;t line up with their unpleasant treatment of key staff.&#0160; When my Pro account runs out I probably won&#39;t renew it, which means I need to unpublish about 130 photos.</p><p><a href="http://edwardvielmetti.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> - Like a bad penny, it follows you around, collecting scraps of things that you once fed it and keeping them for all eternity.&#0160; There was once a time when I used Jaiku when Twitter was down, but it&#39;s been so thoroughly orphaned by Google that it&#39;s hardly worth the bother.&#0160; &#0160; </p><p><a href="http://plazes.com/users/5955">Plazes</a> - Like a bad pfennig, it follows you around, collecting scraps of information about where you were and remembering them for all time.&#0160; I used to use Plazes, but enough creepy encounters from people who were unsubtle about the uses of always-on geolocation soured me on the use of any remote location tracking software ever again. </p><p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/people/view/4400930-vielmetti">Scribd</a> - Hey, once upon a time I created an account!&#0160; I hope they have password recovery.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10XJYJ0AHB3QY">Amazon</a> - This bio is a few years old.&#0160; Do I really want to share my wish list - which no one has ever bought me anything from - with the world?&#0160; After all I don&#39;t really use it as a wish list, just a way to bookmark things within Amazon.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Edward_Vielmetti">Wikipedia</a> - Eeek!&#0160; A wiki. &#0160; Not very useful or helpful as a profile page, perhaps that&#39;s just as well.</p><p><a href="http://portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100105173">ACM Portal</a> - Only one publication; gotta get on that.</p><p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/edward.vielmetti">Pandora</a> - I haven&#39;t used this in how many years?&#0160; </p><p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/members/16128/">Meetup</a> - Party like it&#39;s 2002.</p><p><a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Edward_Vielmetti">Xing</a> - If I&#39;m going to really use this, then it needs a complete overhaul - what&#39;s there is also woefully out of date.&#0160; I&#39;d be better off starting over.</p><p><a href="http://a2skatepark.org/profile/EdwardVielmetti">a2skatepark</a> - eek!&#0160; Ning, I think, gets the credit or blame for this skeletal self-description.</p><p><a href="http://www.plaxo.com/directory/profile/38654936346/209b82c7/Edward/Vielmetti">Plaxo</a> - eek!&#0160; Needs work.</p><p><a href="http://www.plodt.com/vielmetti/">plodt</a> - huh?&#0160; I never remember signing up for this, but it seems to be stalking me.</p><p><a href="http://www.vegguide.org/user/597">VegGuide</a> - I apparently used this once back in 2004, and it hasn&#39;t forgetten about me yet.&#0160; Yet.</p><p><a href="http://www.43things.com/person/edwardvielmetti">43 Things</a> - For a brief shining moment in 2004 this was interesting; now it&#39;s just more crap on the net beyond my direct control.&#0160; I hope they have password recovery.</p><p><a href="http://360.yahoo.com/profile-FOLvu.o0ba8lWOZm5gQ86w--?cq=1">Yahoo 360</a> - I had hoped that they had killed this off, but I guess they didn&#39;t; the sleeping baby on the front page is now almost 4 years old.&#0160; (cute kid, huh?)</p><p><a href="http://www.listphile.com/a2b3_membership_roster/Edward_Vielmetti">ListPhile</a> - I hope they have password recovery; I don&#39;t remember ever signing up for it, but there I am larger than life.&#0160; Huh?</p><p><a href="http://edwardvielmetti.vox.com/">Vox</a> - I&#39;m averaging about a post every six months.</p><p>There&#39;s more, I&#39;m sure, and I&#39;m not even counting all of the aggregators and refeeders and etc etc that replicated stuff I wrote without me asking to or having any control over the presentation.</p>
