 When did you get the idea to do an a2parking application, and how long did it take you to go from idea to first version?  In October or November 2011 I was looking at the a2dda website and happened to see the parking space availability on one of the pages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-25-interview-with-douglas-perlin-author-of-a2parking-android-application/">&raquo;</a></p>

Now in its sixth year, the Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire features dozens of makers from across the region and draws over three thousand members of the community for the day’s free events. Metalworkers, inventors, papermakers, artists, students, robot designers, enthusiasts and professional alike teach the public how they make their work. Many participants come away with more than just inspiration, but new skills they can use to fuel their own creations and lasting connections to other makers and resources in the region. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-24-ann-arbor-mini-maker-faire-may-10-2014-washtenaw-community-college/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>From Facebook and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum:
Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan.
This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no "stay" pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately.
Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-march-22-2014-washtenaw-county-clerk-to-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The weekly a2b3 lunch met at Madras Masala on this the third Thursday of March. It's been our habit to meet at Madras on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays. The dining room is large and could seat a large party, but our typical lunch has rarely less than 6 and rarely more than 8 people there, which is just about perfect.
This week's tally was 6, which is just barely big enough to justify a formal round of introductions, but we did it anyway. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-a2b3-lunch-non-summary-for-march-20-2014/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang'an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-april-3-2014-finn-brunton-on-cryptocurrencies-north-quad-space-2435-400-pm/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and start using that instead of Typepad Comments.

        <p>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a responsive design for this blog. Their new "Snap" theme gives you one design that works well on devices of various sizes. I'm liking it so far.
The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of the "blockquote" font size and weight:
 Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I'd prefer to make it quite a bit less bold since I don't use it so much. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-20-a-new-responsive-design-for-this-weblog/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and book-buying habits show a schism between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.
Wayne Baker's new book United America looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-united-america-divided-media/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was up late the other night when the news that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was missing came out. There was a flurry of speculation as to its whereabouts, but no hard news. I went to bed figuring that by morning the mystery would be resolved.
That was four days ago, and the plane is still missing and the mystery has only deepened. Short of going on a search and rescue mission yourself, the closest that anyone can do to chip in on the search is to join in on Tomnod which has a crowd-sourced digital image recognition system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-12-the-mystery-of-flight-mh370/">&raquo;</a></p>
