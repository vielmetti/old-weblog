        <p>I've been fond of maps and graphs for a long time, but haven't had a good set of tools to play with that easily generate decent versions of same from various data sets I've found or accumulated.
The small hope is that a little bit of hacking on the right tools will fix this.
One of the tools of choice is R, a language for statistics and data analysis. It's tremendously powerful and a bit complicated, but I'm not trying to learn the whole thing; rather, I'm after just the barest minimum so that I can competently generate a scatterplot of data and place it onto a map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-28-r-me-hearties/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my favorite weather forecasts comes from forecast.io. This screen shows the ensemble set of forecasts they have for temperature for tomorrow (February 20, 2015), highlighting the 8:00 a.m. reading.

You'll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is RAP from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Looking at their set of pages they have a nice cold temperature forecast map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-20-super-cold-but-sunny-dont-forget-that-it-was-sunny/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don't ask me why.) Here's some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more.
First, some prior art. How to make a tactile compass feedback belt is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-15-designing-a-wearable-magnetic-sensor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it's cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate.
I thought I'd use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch.
The setup:
Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag. I'm using RabbitMQ as my MQTT message passing system, but that's not strictly necessary for this application. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-27-just-how-cold-is-that-window-winter-monitoring-with-the-ti-sensortag-node-red-and-freeboard/">&raquo;</a></p>

As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People's Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-25-psychedelic-rangers-ann-arbor-1972/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The Ann Arbor News story tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.
What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-12-vellum-a-downtown-ann-arbor-restaurant-has-closed/">&raquo;</a></p>

Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.
The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-05-ann-arbor-city-council-highlights-for-5-january-2015-a-preview/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65 pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into the machine. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-03-olivetti-programma-101/">&raquo;</a></p>

 “Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. "It doesn't exist. That's the point," says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-beggers-funnel-plot-a-marker-for-irregularities-in-scientific-publication/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.
The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-listening-to-radio-havana-cuba-via-shortwave/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Dr. Dobb's Journal is closing down, with its last issue appearing at the end of 2014. They tell their story in a final report.
The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.
 Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb's, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-dr-dobbs-journal-shuffles-off-this-mortal-coil/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there's a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what's being said on RF and vice versa.
websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-09-some-notes-on-echolink-and-websdr/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Nothing personal, but it's time to take a break from Twitter.
I tried to do this back in 2008 when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren't going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don't feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it's time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-30-im-taking-a-break-from-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out that the routine I have with Google's Gmail for handling inbound correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.

 Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the parts that "just work", because undoubtably there are unexpected cases that won't work just when you need them to work.  Identify the message flows through the system. Where do signals get generated, where do they get retransmitted, where do they get changed and when does a human interpret them? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-21-how-does-this-system-even-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours.
