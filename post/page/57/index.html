    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Trying to keep the chronology going - this is back to Monday of this week. I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at AnnArbor.com .&#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be. I&#39;ve been wrestling with this, in part because I&#39;ve been blogging so long (since 1999) that there has been a big shift in what the popular press has characterized and categorized bloggers as.&#0160; When I started, the blogger was either the extremely widely read Internet explorer who kept a log of the many interesting things that came across their path, or it was the expert in some field (at times a very narrow field) who used a less formal sequential writing tool to capture details and query others in their niche interest about what was going on and relevant. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-08-blogger-vs-journalist-day-5/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process. Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early. In some sense that&#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &quot;law of two feet&quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people.&#0160; I had a great time but the dynamic was odd enough that I want to try to get to a 100pm stop time again instead of 130pm.&#0160; So here&#39;s some suggestions that came in from that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-03-a2b3-nonsummary-for-july-2-2009-how-to-introduce-lots-of-people/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s a complete list of where all of the Amelanchier (juneberry, shadbush, sugar plum depending on where you are from) trees are on the public streets in Ann Arbor.&#0160; The complete inventory shows 356 trees, each geocoded; rather than try to pin them on a map, this is by street name in alphabetical order, with quite a bit of duplicates eliminated. The whole program to do this is grep -i Amelanchier trees09.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3, &quot;between&quot;, $4, &quot;and &quot; $5}&#39; | sort | uniq &gt; juneberry.txt where the trees09.csv file is downloadable from the Ann Arbor Chronicle who originally sourced this data from the city of Ann Arbor; see their story about it here. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-03-amelanchier-shadbush-juneberry-sugar-plum-inventory-for-ann-arbor-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89.1 WEMU FM; and Dave Gershman from the Ann Arbor News.&#0160; Some part of the DDA meeting was also recorded by video cameras; I haven&#39;t figured out yet how to replay that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-on-the-media-and-government-watching-the-dda-day-3/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bob Frankston - Opportunity for Innovation Perhaps the most difficult concept is the need to invert our usual “procurement” model of problem solving – we can’t dictate the solutions but instead need to create (generative) opportunity and then accept the solutions that arise. We can only dictate solutions for the short term but we’re rewarded for short term thinking. This makes it doubly difficult to “sell” the idea that we need to create opportunity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-links-for-2009-07-01/">&raquo;</a></p>

Trek Glowacki: Best event I&#39;ve attended all year. Nearly perfect execution from both speakers and organizers. Congrats to all involved. A few high points: Eli Neiburger from the AADL on hacking your library; Eric from the Ann Arbor Go Club on the game of Go; the friggin lasers at the A2 Mechshop; high flying balloons; backyard satellite weather, and two versions of News 2.0, at least one of which should be better than News 184x where the publisher accepted payment in potatoes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-30-ignite-ann-arbor-1-a-rousing-success/">&raquo;</a></p>
