I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at AnnArbor.com .&#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-08-blogger-vs-journalist-day-5/">&raquo;</a></p>

Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.

        <p>Save journalism? Beats us, panel says - Patrick Gavin - POLITICO.com “At any given moment, there is a panel taking place somewhere in the world discussing the future of journalism,” Aspen Institute president and longtime journalist Walter Isaacson said at the end of Tuesday night’s panel discussion titled, “What’s the News Worth to You?” (tags: journalism future but-what-about-the-past-of-journalism)  The Day Reagan Was Shot - CBS News Haig answered the reporter: “Constitutionally gentlemen, you have the president, the vice president and the secretary of state, in that order, and should the president decide he wants to transfer the helm to the vice president, he will do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-02-links-for-2009-07-02/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>day 3 notes
I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.
In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-on-the-media-and-government-watching-the-dda-day-3/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Another part of day 3 -
We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-movable-type-rich-text-editors-and-stripping-weird-tags/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bob Frankston - Opportunity for Innovation Perhaps the most difficult concept is the need to invert our usual “procurement” model of problem solving – we can’t dictate the solutions but instead need to create (generative) opportunity and then accept the solutions that arise.
We can only dictate solutions for the short term but we’re rewarded for short term thinking. This makes it doubly difficult to “sell” the idea that we need to create opportunity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-links-for-2009-07-01/">&raquo;</a></p>

Best event I&#39;ve attended all year. Nearly perfect execution from both speakers and organizers. Congrats to all involved.
