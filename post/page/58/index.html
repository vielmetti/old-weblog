        <p>Another part of day 3 - We&#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&#0160; And the question came up, because it&#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript.&#0160; Microsoft Word is one version of that process; there&#39;s lots more paths that get there. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-movable-type-rich-text-editors-and-stripping-weird-tags/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Bob Frankston - Opportunity for Innovation Perhaps the most difficult concept is the need to invert our usual “procurement” model of problem solving – we can’t dictate the solutions but instead need to create (generative) opportunity and then accept the solutions that arise. We can only dictate solutions for the short term but we’re rewarded for short term thinking. This makes it doubly difficult to “sell” the idea that we need to create opportunity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-01-links-for-2009-07-01/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There were a ton of people twittering from the event, held tonight at the Neutral Zone.&#0160; It started promptly at 7pm, ended promptly at 9pm, featured a single-elimination rock scissors paper tournament (A2RSP, of course), and was generally and genuinely awesome.&#0160; Attendance was about 200. Trek Glowacki: Best event I&#39;ve attended all year. Nearly perfect execution from both speakers and organizers. Congrats to all involved. A few high points: Eli Neiburger from the AADL on hacking your library; Eric from the Ann Arbor Go Club on the game of Go; the friggin lasers at the A2 Mechshop; high flying balloons; backyard satellite weather, and two versions of News 2.0, at least one of which should be better than News 184x where the publisher accepted payment in potatoes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-30-ignite-ann-arbor-1-a-rousing-success/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>So, I have a new Blackberry replacing my old Blackberry.&#0160; The new device has a camera in it, which I never had before in a phone.&#0160; So therefore I need to figure out how to get pictures from the phone to the various places I put pictures now and understand the path. Facebook: My phone has a Facebook app - it was even pre-installed.&#0160; So the camera has a &quot;Send to Facebook&quot; menu entry, which sends it up.&#0160; Here&#39;s a few docs.&#0160; I&#39;ve used this already, it&#39;s fast and easy. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-30-how-to-post-photos-from-a-blackberry-to-the-net/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mediactive » What Pays for Newspaper Journalism? Not the “Cover Price” Cowell doesn’t mention that the advertising is the most important part of the financial equation in paying for journalism, not the cover price. It has been so for as long as he’s been a journalist. The word “Advertise” appears three times on this Web page (and “Advertisements” once), but not in Cowell’s column. (tags: newspaper journalism advertising money-its-a-gas) Ombudsman Blog - Froomkin Departs, Leaving Angry Loyalists And Questions Froomkin acknowledges the drop but told me much of it can be blamed on a change in format and poor promotion. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-27-links-for-2009-06-27/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Reinventing classifieds: MinnPost launches “real-time advertising” » Nieman Journalism Lab In a phone conversation this morning, Kramer described the project as “an effort to move beyond banner ads,” which have proven lucrative for the site, but also limited. MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota. (That’s one reason the CPM is so good.) As a result, the site had several weeks this spring when marketers’ demand for advertising space exceeded the site’s supply of local readership. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-26-links-for-2009-06-26/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>echovar » Blog Archive » Real-Time Writing: A Transvaluation of All Values As a story plays out across the Network, as new information is uncovered, the inputs are routed through the mixing board of the writer’s keyboard. A writer must now listen to how the whole jam is sounding— the writer is a player down in the groove with other players. As we learn to write through a real-time medium, we’ll need to look to the values, standards and practices of live performance. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-25-links-for-2009-06-25/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Of course it isn&#39;t Wednesday yet, but I&#39;ll be a day early. One of the things I&#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&#39;t exist yet.&#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen. Every so often people do edit this page - but often they don&#39;t.&#0160; A reasonable goal is to try to minimize the number of times people get frustrated, so one way to track that is to look at the fraction of pages over time where people hit a blank page and try to minimize that.&#0160; Looking at it over the last 3 months it appears that 3.2% of page views go to a page that doesn&#39;t exist yet - if you do a &quot;Top Content&quot; report, and then filter for the string &quot;redlink&quot;, you&#39;ll get what you want. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-23-wiki-wednesday-using-google-analytics-to-find-places-to-add-to-your-content/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity. It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-22-on-the-virtue-of-cheap-paper/">&raquo;</a></p>
