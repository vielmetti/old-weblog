        <p>I'm not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the new comment stream into Disqus. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-the-next-major-change-for-this-weblog-is-converting-over-comments-to-disqus/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a responsive design for this blog. Their new "Snap" theme gives you one design that works well on devices of various sizes. I'm liking it so far.
The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of the "blockquote" font size and weight:
 Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I'd prefer to make it quite a bit less bold since I don't use it so much. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-20-a-new-responsive-design-for-this-weblog/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Papillon (a.k.a. the PeanutButterFly) is a Caribbean American poet and song-writer from Paris, France. Raised with a very culturally diverse environment and brought up in a world of entertainment, this multi-media artist has been an actor and musician since the early age of 12. After a first solo album called “the Amber Dawn” he is returning to the stage with the double album “Calligraphy”. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-distribute-it-to-the-lower-level-papillon-mike-wird/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and book-buying habits show a schism between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.
Wayne Baker's new book United America looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-united-america-divided-media/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was up late the other night when the news that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was missing came out. There was a flurry of speculation as to its whereabouts, but no hard news. I went to bed figuring that by morning the mystery would be resolved.
That was four days ago, and the plane is still missing and the mystery has only deepened. Short of going on a search and rescue mission yourself, the closest that anyone can do to chip in on the search is to join in on Tomnod which has a crowd-sourced digital image recognition system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-12-the-mystery-of-flight-mh370/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A review of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.
Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-09-a-review-of-social-physics-how-good-ideas-spread-the-lessons-from-a-new-science-alex-pentland/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mr. Jim Doyle, a long time Lower Burns Park resident, passed away late last month at the Grand Rapids VA. Mr. Doyle had lived at 1023 Granger Ave. for over 50 years. He served in the Philippines on General MacArthur's staff during the war. After the war, Mr. Doyle returned to Ann Arbor where after the passing of his parents, he spent the majority of his adult life taking care of his younger brother who was severely disabled. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-06-obituary-james-doyle-lower-burns-park-resident-whose-home-was-rehabbed-by-community-groups-in-2006/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Meetup.com has had a series of bad days. Their site has been under a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for a number of days. To mitigate the problem, they are using the CloudFlare service, but even that has not been working great.
The net effect is that sometimes the Meetup.com site is unavailable, making it hard to sign up or schedule or reschedule events. The Meetup periodic announcements about the problem emphasize how hard they are working to fix it and how user credit cards are not at risk. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-03-meetupcom-ddos-attack-continues-march-3-2014/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The website of Mt.

The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks.

        <p>Depending on the source you get a slightly different story, but the results are the same: there is a lot of volatility in Bitcoin pricing in early February 2014 because of problems at the Mt. Gox exchange. So much for a technologically pristine, mathematically pure, decentralized currency; when your "foreign exchange" depends on a very small number of businesses, it can have systematic vulnerabilities.

        <p>I&rsquo;m interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.

I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-09-decoding-radio-digital-modes-without-a-radio-using-websdr-and-fldigi/">&raquo;</a></p>
