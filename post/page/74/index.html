Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you're from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy. They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you're walking down the street. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-17-2008-urban-berr/">&raquo;</a></p>

Now you can report power outages on line using a mobile device.
Just go to mobile.dteenergy.com with your web-based cell phone or PDA. In moments you can report an outage or get a repair estimate on a previously reported outage.

This is reporting only, not mapping, and the mobile interface has the most pessimistic assumptions about mobile phone capacity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-dte-energy-the/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Continuing the summer power grid watch theme - lots of Oakland County, MI still is waiting for restoration of service - let's look at the real time map for watching the greater power grid.
In the Midwest, power coordination between utilities is done through the Midwest ISO, an organization that is responsible for orderly transfer of capacity between generators and transmission lines and for helping plan and predict seasonal and outage-related load changes that require competitors to work together. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-how-hot-is-your/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Last year there was a fire near Sleeper Lake in Newberry, MI in the UP; when I wrote about it, I collected fire maps of the Sleeper Lake area showing where the fire lines were. That fire is out now, but that page where I had those maps is still getting a steady stream of page views. So, I have to ask, why?
The other popular seasonal page is my annual Michigan morel map, which I pull an excerpt from the morel progression sightings map and highlight the appearance of these tasty mushrooms in the Michigan woods. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-sleeper-lake-fi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Laura Fisher (and a cast of thousands) is organizing Ann Arbor Startup Weekend, June 20-22 2008 in downtown Ann Arbor.

There's a nice story in the Ann Arbor News about the event; I'll excerpt:

The intent of the event, which has been held in several cities throughout the country, is to start the weekend with no formal business plans and emerge a few days later with a couple of real companies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-ann-arbor-start/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Detroit News has some reporting on the DTE power outages across the Detroit metro region.

The company serves Metro Detroit, home to about 136,000 of the homes and businesses still without power. More than two-thirds of those -- 95,000 -- are in Oakland County, where frustrations are running high as schools and businesses remained closed and families flocked to hotels for temporary shelter. Since Sunday night, an estimated 600,000 people in Michigan have been affected by the outages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-11-dte-power-outag/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>In the "try this next year" category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down. Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there's frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don't have soil.
Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-28-how-to-plant-to/">&raquo;</a></p>
