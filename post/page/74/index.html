    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Last year there was a fire near Sleeper Lake in Newberry, MI in the UP; when I wrote about it, I collected fire maps of the Sleeper Lake area showing where the fire lines were. That fire is out now, but that page where I had those maps is still getting a steady stream of page views. So, I have to ask, why? The other popular seasonal page is my annual Michigan morel map, which I pull an excerpt from the morel progression sightings map and highlight the appearance of these tasty mushrooms in the Michigan woods. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-sleeper-lake-fi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Google's Street View has come to Ann Arbor. From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon. The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi's toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn. Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort. With the exception of a short foray through the private drive in Barton Hills, nothing outside the freeway limits was explored. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-11-google-street-v/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Detroit News has some reporting on the DTE power outages across the Detroit metro region. The company serves Metro Detroit, home to about 136,000 of the homes and businesses still without power. More than two-thirds of those -- 95,000 -- are in Oakland County, where frustrations are running high as schools and businesses remained closed and families flocked to hotels for temporary shelter. Since Sunday night, an estimated 600,000 people in Michigan have been affected by the outages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-11-dte-power-outag/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form. Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.

He's doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won't even try to be up to date with that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-05-quake-lakes-and/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>In the "try this next year" category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down. Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there's frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don't have soil. Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-28-how-to-plant-to/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>every once in a while you have to look at the net to see what other people say that you are. so here's that search for a2b3. First, all the things that don't relate to the lunch meeting: A2B3 is a rare genotype resulting from the inheritance of both A and B genes on one chromosome. The p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein inhibits a2b3 integrin-mediated cell spreading on vitronectin by blocking PKC-dependent localization of a2b3 to focal contacts Unicode Character 'YI SYLLABLE CIEX' (U+A2B3) These two transcripts differ by 75 bp and the protein that is coded by a2b3 has 25 amino acids more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-23-what-is-a2b3-ge/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Christian Science Monitor has a good story with pictures of the current state of the "Mississippi Cottage" design of manufactured housing. Hurricane Katrina downsized his domain to nothing. Today, his new castle is about one-seventh the size of his old one, measuring 450 square feet. But surveying the familiar view from the dollhouse porch of his &ldquo;Mississippi cottage,&rdquo; Mr. Voorhies is one of many storm survivors who have reassessed their coastal existence. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-22-building-missis/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>ALL WATCHED OVER BY MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE I like to think (and the sooner the better!) of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky. I like to think (right now, please!) of a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms. I like to think (it has to be!) of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-21-all-watched-ove/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A few definitions for you, with citations from the wild; spelling is as in the original with Google counts of occurences, if possible. In short: threequel and 3quel are about movies; threequal is the "===" operator; 3qual is hacker speak. More or less. threequel (33,900): When I was a kid, I assumed all third installments in a horror series had to capitalize on the ability to turn the “3″ in the title into “3-D.” Now, looking back, I only really remember (and can only find proof of) Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th 3-D and Amityville 3-D. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-threequel-three/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Reification is an ontological imperative. I think that this might be some deep statement about the semantic web, but it's so deep that I really don't understand it. Reification in this sense appears to have something to do with taking abstract concepts and making them concrete, turning ad hoc heuristics into code, writing down a set of things into a list so that it can be machine processed and sorted, and otherwise taking thoughts and ideas and turning them into bits. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-reification-is/">&raquo;</a></p>
