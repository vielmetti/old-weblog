 The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation.
 Kinetrics has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-simulating-a-power-grid-with-rtds/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don't have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you're expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively.
I'm making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-automating-web-testing-and-scraping-with-selenium-and-the-firefox-selenium-ide/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough.
Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called runC. It's a "lightweight universal plumbing" that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure.  To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.
 Because of Docker's start on Linux systems, it's been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-22-dockers-new-runc-doesnt-yet-work-on-mac-os-x-/">&raquo;</a></p>

Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting.
One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online.

DRAFT POLICY 5060 - STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS

        <p>@tallervielmetti is using my old black Macbook. It's never been an exceptionally fast machine, but it's been super laggy of late, hence the name Lag Monster. I installed all kinds of crap on that machine to test it out, and never uninstalled a lot of it. It turns out that some judicious uninstalls seemed to help a lot to keep the load average down.

The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.
Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.
The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-building-a-dipole-antenna-for-your-sdr-tuner-stick-from-an-old-set-of-headphones/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.
For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-17-two-repaired-shortwave-receivers-in-one-day-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.
I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city's employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-14-when-is-ann-arbor-going-to-have-a-full-time-building-official/">&raquo;</a></p>
