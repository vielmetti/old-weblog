They have support for Ann Arbor as a city, so I tried it while riding AAATA (The Ride). http://www.ridescoutapp.com/ It's the first independent app that I've seen that shows where every AAATA stop is, in a nice little app that works on your phone with a zippy little map that scrolls nicely. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-10-a-test-of-ridescout-for-ann-arbor-multi-modal-transit-use/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm completely happy with my choice of HI-Chicago as a place to stay. It's inexpensive, clean, well run, the staff is friendly, and there's lots of community space in the building to get things done in outside of your room. I stayed here for the eChicago conference in an 8-person room; this time I upgraded to the 4-person room. Two nights stay is less than $100, which is hard to beat. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-07-staying-at-hosteling-international-chicago-hi-chicago/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too. Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don't have enough oomph to take on an Internet's worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-internet-of-things-world-hasnt-condensed-into-a-single-system-and-because-of-its-origins-its-unl/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-bee-app-a-multiplatform-issue-tracker-client-for-mac/">&raquo;</a></p>

The Commission on Disability Issues made a request to add captions to their meetings to increase meeting accessibility. Who is providing the closed captioning for CTN? ScreenLine, L.L.C. How much is the size of the contract, and for how long does it run? We do not have a contract with the company, we’re in a trial period and they’ll be invoicing us each time we use their service. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-02-answers-from-ctn-regarding-city-of-ann-arbor-closed-captioning/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Editorial debt accumulates when the passage of time makes a document less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated. For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-accumulating-editorial-debt-and-dealing-with-out-of-date-text/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a 750 word essay every day. I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-do-you-still-write-750-words-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The unit of analysis is the parking structure. It has a capacity c, and a usage u(t) for any time t observed. If u/c &gt; 0.8 the structure is congested; at u/c &gt; 0.9 the structure is full. That reduces the time series of usage for a given structure into one of three values (green, yellow, red).

        <p>How do you organize materials such that they don't get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it's hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world. I'm noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I'd have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-keeping-up-with-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>
