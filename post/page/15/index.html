        <p>In Michigan, February is 13 months long. That's why I'm thinking of simulated sunrise applications that turn a pleasant light on slowly to mimic the sunrise. I don't need this in July, but I will need it come February. If you've tried one of these things let me know, I'll fill in the blank space here with more information as I get it. Some products follow. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-07-09-simulating-a-sunrise-for-the-dark-winter-months/">&raquo;</a></p>

This looks like a job for SUMPY MCPUMPERTON! &mdash; Sumpy McPumperton (@GregsSumpPump) July 1, 2014 ANN ARBOR, July 1, 2014: The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission is considering the Glendale Condominiums, a proposed development at 312 Glendale Place. Neighbors came out in force to oppose the development, citing among other things the impact that the proposed new impervious surface would exacerbate the existing flooding events that have affected the nearby neighborhoods. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-07-01-the-internet-of-sump-pumps-and-citizen-opposition-to-glendale-place-condos-ann-arbor-planning/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The single most popular page on this web site is the power outage tracking map collection page. It has static copies of samples of power outage maps from utilities around the country, and it gets bunches of hits every single time there's bad weather - to the extent that I can pretty much tell where there's bad weather by the outbound clicks on the page. The page, however, is not fed with live data; it only has static instances of previous maps. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-27-the-internet-of-power-outages/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have found myself thinking about things, and how to connect things to the net, quite a bit recently. I'll be blogging more about it here and elsewhere. By "things" I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can't connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-27-the-internet-of-things/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For future reference, here's a distribution for the Raspberry Pi that's designed for server use. It has stripped out a bunch of things (like X Windows) that you don't want or don't need if all you need is a headless server running some control process. It's maintained by Lawrence Yau (sirlagz), and the 2.5 version is based on Debian "Jessie".

It's a hacker space in a basement on E Liberty St in downtown Ann Arbor (at Maynard Street), where Dawn Treader was once upon a time and later Digital Ops. I decided a few weeks ago to become a member, so that I'd have a workshop that was well stocked with equipment and so that I could start working on projects in a place that not only had cool stuff but also that had smart people and was convenient to downtown. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-14-all-hands-active-just-signed-up/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a thought experiment for 2014. What do you do with the Internet of Cats? You have a cat with a collar, and some number of grams of electronics that can be affixed to the collar. What kind of interesting internet stuff can go there? So far I've found the StickNFind, which is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon with a key fob attachment and some pictures of cats wearing it as a tag. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-06-08-the-internet-of-cats-iocats/">&raquo;</a></p>

It was a timely day to be productive, and the morning's activity resulted in a further productive afternoon meeting. It was a good day. (Not every day is always a good day for writing.) How do I get away from distractions? The key was to find an unusual place in this world: a location with good enough coffee, enough power outlets, broken wifi and no cell service. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-05-09-seek-out-the-quiet-zone-without-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Did you ever wake up from a long session online and discover that you had very little to show for it? There's a pattern of internet use that's simple and very disturbingly unproductive. Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn't produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you've visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there's something new. It's a wonderful way to consume content, and since you're always looking at new things it's a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-05-08-creating-vs-consuming/">&raquo;</a></p>
