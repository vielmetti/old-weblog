    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist? There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-31-on-non-disclosure-and-keeping-trade-secrets/">&raquo;</a></p>

As we announced the Real-Time reports show you what is happening on your website as it happens. Once upon a time, there was mybloglog. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it. Google now has a real time version of Google Analytics, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-19-google-analytics-real-time-vs-mybloglog/">&raquo;</a></p>
