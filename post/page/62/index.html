Priority one is a book purge; I&#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-21-discardia-for-spring-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Previously: Paper, plastic or burlap (2008) The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags. As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event: There&#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member Stephen Rapundalo, who&#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-ann-arbor-plastic-bag-ban-vote-postponed/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>noted on Geert&#39;s blog IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network! Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friends’ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)! <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-03-ipv6-over-social-network-a-facebook-application-for-routing-packets-over-friend-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I stumbled into a world of &ldquo;parking advocacy organizations&rdquo; (trade associations for parking structure operators) and this video about how a garage in California is using per-space lights and sensors to speed up the process of people finding parking in a structure that&rsquo;s mostly full. The parking rhetoric in Ann Arbor is that a structure is full if it&rsquo;s at 85% capacity, based on one consultant&rsquo;s recommendations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to challenge that and say that no one really cares how full a garage is if you know that you won&rsquo;t be frustrated finding a space. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-01-where-is-the-nearest-free-parking-space-how-to-fill-parking-structures-at-more-than-85/">&raquo;</a></p>
