        <p>I used to organize lunch every Thursday at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. Then the restaurant closed, and my A2B3 lunch group was set adrift. Here's what we've been up to. First and foremost, the email list that goes with the group has been steady even with the disruption in the lunch routine. There's a steady stream of questions with answers, job postings, news about events and the like. List membership is in the 450 range, and a relatively typical month has about 90 messages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-22-i-still-organize-lunch-every-thursday-a2b3-in-the-post-eastern-accents-era/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the Tasty Green Cafe inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-15-tasty-green-cafe-at-ann-arbor-city-hall/">&raquo;</a></p>
