Quince caramel from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-01-october-2011-recipes-quince/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I spotted Nickel Plate 765 as it was heading north through Ann Arbor on Tuesday, September 27, 2011. It was easy to recognize from the clouds of black smoke and the distinctive steam whistle.
 This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-29-nickel-plate-765-steaming-through-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The UARS satellite is making its way back to earth. Here's some parts of the ways to track it. (Think of it as research for your next disaster movie.)
On Twitter, the #UARS hash tag has a lot of traffic. I'm following @UARS_Reentry and @NASA and that's enough to get the summary information.
Heavens Above has an orbital display with current location information; you'll need to refresh periodically.

I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.
The 2011 hurricane season crisis map from Google&#0160;has the first large scale version of a multi-utility outage map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-07-combined-east-coast-power-outage-tracking-map-/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Vermont was hard hit by Irene. There are lots of photos and videos out there showing some of the devastation and flooding; here are maps that give some sense for the area involved.&#0160;
Vermont Flooding 2011 on Facebook&#0160;is a good community resource, as is Mad River Valley Hurricane Irene. For volunteer coordination, see the VTResponse weblog.
Detailed city maps showing flooded areas are not yet available.

            <p>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated.
 Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-23-hurricane-irenes-path-forecasts/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next.
Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-17-what-to-write/">&raquo;</a></p>

For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;.
