    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The evening's work can be roughly summed up as Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with 'A'. Much of the time, that will be a person's name. Comment on that person's weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch. Repeat until 'Z'. In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on "The algorithm driven day". In reading through it I am not sure it needs to see the light of day just yet, but it does help me wonder what parts of our efforts are driven by randomness and which are put there by design and how on earth one might tell the difference. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-28-a-random-walk-through-the-rolodex/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>squid is a web caching system. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don't have the data, and way faster when you do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-28-using-a-squid-cache-to-make-automated-data-collection-a-bit-less-rude/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don't think that's the part of the hobby I'm most interested in. The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you'd think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that's hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-28-disappointed-by-amateur-radio-contests/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There's lots of Reddy Kilowatt information and memorabilia on ReddyKilowatt.org. This is a completely unofficial web site dedicated to Reddy Kilowatt. It features history, memorabilia, items for sale and more. Please note that I can’t/don’t/won’t estimate the value of any of your Reddy collectibles. Seriously. Ever. Try looking at the going price at eBay or at other antique dealers if you want to find out how much any particular Reddy Kilowatt item might be worth. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-25-reddy-kilowatt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Noted as an example of "how do they do that" The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation. Kinetrics has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-simulating-a-power-grid-with-rtds/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don't have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you're expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively. I'm making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-automating-web-testing-and-scraping-with-selenium-and-the-firefox-selenium-ide/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough. Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called runC. It's a "lightweight universal plumbing" that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure. To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on. Because of Docker's start on Linux systems, it's been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-22-dockers-new-runc-doesnt-yet-work-on-mac-os-x-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I attended this week's meeting of the Governance Committee of the Ann Arbor Board of Education, and this is what I saw. Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting. One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online. It had several typoes and missspellings, including an incorrect reference to statute. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-17-governance-and-documentation-and-getting-board-documents-online-promptly/">&raquo;</a></p>
