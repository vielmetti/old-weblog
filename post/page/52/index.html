        <p>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece.

        <p>It&#39;s harvest time, which means there are a lot of recipes you can do with food that you can buy locally. One thing that would help that a lot is finding the people who buy the same stuff you do, and who share the same tastes, and who can work with you to figure out how to stock up so you have enough on your shelves always to get a meal on the table. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-06-local-seasonal-recipe-guide/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Also known as &quot;retcon&quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &#0160;As pulled from the notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon (at least today):
 &quot;Retroactive continuity&quot; was shortened to &quot;retcon&quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&#0160;USENET. Hard evidence of Cugley&#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &quot;The originator of the word &#39;retcon&#39;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-10-05-retroactive-continuity/">&raquo;</a></p>
