From the Renesys blog, &quot;Egypt leaves the Internet&quot;
 At 22:34 UTC (00:34am local time), Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet&#39;s global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt&#39;s service providers. Virtually all of Egypt&#39;s Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-28-egypt-disconnects-from-the-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The video, entitled "It is pitch dark", from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot.

The lyrics, in part:
You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue?
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-21-you-are-likely-to-be-eaten-by-a-grue/">&raquo;</a></p>

Time and space happened, and Flickr became part of Yahoo. A piece of the fun drained out, and the Internet got bigger. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-03-what-to-do-with-flickr/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place assigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point of material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought goods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former serve their primary purpose more adequately. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-18-thorstein-veblen-cranky-economist-on-handmade-goods/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup.
The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere.
The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-17-delicious-ketchup/">&raquo;</a></p>

Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.
Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-17-alas-poor-delicious-you-knew-us-well/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a cheaper way to clean a dishwasher than to put heavily marketed, sugary &ldquo;breakfast drink&rdquo; powder into it. Tang is citric acid and sweetener and artificial flavor that tastes like moon rocks.
The dishwasher is cleaner, though, which is a good thing.
Other suggestions for cleaners include vinegar, straight citric acid, borax, and baking soda. None of those have the astronaut cachet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-16-clean-your-dishwasher-with-the-breakfast-drink-of-astronauts/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The powdered capsicum slightly dusted in the socks of persons subject to cold feet will generally prove a salutary means of overpowering that unpleasant sensation. (The American Dispensatory, 1823)
