        <p>Here's a bit of science fiction I'd like to read -
The time is the future, but the near future, within reach - perhaps 2012. The hero has some kind of cognitive deficit that's progressive, so that they are slowly losing their ability to reason. (Think Flowers for Algernon, for instance.)
The twist is that the nature of the loss of thinking is that they are fine in person and in everything they normally do, but that they are unable to effectively use search engines any more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-25-noe-web-disease/">&raquo;</a></p>

At retail, Busch's in Ann Arbor is currently selling them for $14.99 for a 5 pound box, or $1. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-24-buy-michigan-bl/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS
By John Clark
My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-blueberry-summe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At one point I had a whole blog devoted to collecting information about the telegraph; it's still there, but dormant. Ah, passing interests.
Along the way, I got this suggestion, which I share:

"If you're looking for "telegraph literature" (i.e. stories involving telegraphs) then you should certainly read "The Telegraph Girl" by Anthony Trollope and an accompanying article "The Young Women at the London Telegraph Office" and then Kipling's story " <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-the-telegraph-i/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From time to time people ask questions about Ann Arbor, and from time to time there are what appear to be encyclopedic responses to them. Part of the reason for this is Arborwiki, a wiki that covers information about Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Washtenaw County and the rest of the area.
Matt Hampel runs this with an ad hoc collective doing editorial direction and the Ann Arbor District Library providing hosting. It's not advertising driven, and while is has a lot of information about businesses any obviously marketing copy gets edited out pretty quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-thank-you-for-s/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It's fruit season (or nearly so) and so it's time to start thinking about what we're going to do for making holiday gifts. One staple in our house is a simple fruit liqueur of some sort, which turns sugar + fruit + vodka + time into something yummy.
We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-making-fruit-li/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>&quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&quot; (Jack Shedd)
Jack has more in a rant that&#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &quot;cheese food manufacturing&quot; that Merlin Mann observes as dominating the world of &quot;pro bloggers&quot;.
In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &quot;pick any two&quot; is the easiest answer. It&#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

It's just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.
There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor. The Dexter Blueberry Farm is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-09-2008-michigan-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every once in a long while, you run across something so wonderful you have to share.
I have been tracking hits to the Google search Michigan spiders, ever since an odd combination of page text about automated web browsing tools unearthed a bunch of folks trying to identify the spiders crawling across their day lilies.
Today's search logs turned up this amazing resource, the The Backyard Arthropod Project
