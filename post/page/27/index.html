        <p>I was away from my laptop for a few days, but still had use of a mobile phone to view the internet through. (I also had a beach nearby and a room full of relatives). Here&#39;s some observations from the mobile-only internet.
First and foremost, it&#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass. My online composition is sufficiently slow that I can&#39;t come anywhere near close to keeping up with my thoughts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-29-the-mobile-only-internet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>With 25 days to go, the FOIA Machine kickstarter is almost 2x overfunded. They are looking to build a system for automatically tracking and managing FOIA requests.
I am not clear how this effort differs from the already existing MuckRock News system, but there&#39;s room for innovation in the space because FOIA can be the world&#39;s worst search engine and any help is welcomed.

        <p>The Ann Arbor DDA has launched a new web site, and one of the features of it is a map with information available in real time about parking availability at various structures.
 
The structures are in a shade of pale blue, and the lots are in pale green; my current location is marked with a bubble. If you&#39;re looking for just space available information, there&#39;s a JSON file with that data; you&#39;ll have to unpack it to map structures to their ID numbers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-16-ann-arbor-dda-has-a-new-web-site-and-real-time-parking-information-is-available-again/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -
 These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;perceived&#0160;as two different cities.
 The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-15-when-i-hear-a2council-talking-about-the-city-and-the-university-i-think-about-china-mievilles-the-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>
