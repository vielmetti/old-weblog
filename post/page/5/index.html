        <p>This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China.
 Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and social media reports. Social media users have reported that their posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &ldquo;Tianjin&rdquo; and &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo. Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-14-tianjin-explosion/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Lunch at The Broken Egg with the a2b3 crew. We had 17 people show up, which is about 2x what had been the normal attendance. The restaurant was very accomodating, and everyone was well fed.
Organizing lunch is the highlight of my week.
Lots of things were discussed, here&rsquo;s a few of them:
The Perseid meteor shower peaked last night, notes Linda Diane Feldt, who saw a few shooting stars from her cabin in Lyndon Township. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-13-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary-broken-egg/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&rsquo;d like to sort out how to have more long form writing.
From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with structure. It&rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome.
I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-09-long-form/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The a2b3 lunch this week was at Mi Compadre, a Mexican place on Packard. We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.
I was inspired this week for the lunch question by going to the Workantile lunch on Wednesday, which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce yourself around the table, and answer some simple question. At Workantile the prompt was simply &ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&rdquo;, and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-06-a2b3-mi-compadre-non-summary/">&raquo;</a></p>

It collects stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard. &ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&rdquo; is the tag line.

I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on, or the perpetually politically curious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&rsquo;s no internal inconsistencies.
The world usually works in such a way that it&rsquo;s changing fast enough that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is always holding as &ldquo;true&rdquo; in that memory bank something that is demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to, in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&rsquo;s one way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.
The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages. Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many advertisements as we will stand. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-02-blogroll/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In his An internet x-ray machine for the masses, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to mitmproxy, a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to get between your browser and the Internet and poke at (and change) the traffic going between the two.
http://mitmproxy.org is the home of mitmproxy. It&rsquo;s the work of Aldo Cortesi and a cast of hundreds of contributors on github at https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy .

        <p>If you have exactly one copy of something and it&rsquo;s only on Soundcloud, this would be an opportune time to make a backup. That&rsquo;s always a good idea anyway not to rely on single web servers for anything, but it&rsquo;s especially notable in the light of these articles.
First, the upbeat Bloomberg Business article of July 10, 2015:

        <p>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away. I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).
The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&rsquo;m thinking about quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch a postcard from the command line of my Mac. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A first round of postcards sent via Lob.com have arrived or are nearly arrived at their destinations.

A reasonable question is, why do you send them? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-first-round-of-postcards/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Blog every day, whether you want to or not.
Pick a topic, learn it well, and write about it as you learn it. Or pick a topic you know really well already and teach to it. Sometimes you can do both.
The time spent blogging can&rsquo;t be any less worthwhile than time spent on Facebook or Twitter. The exchange is, instead of clicking the like button and the favorite button, you actually have to think a little bit and write something down that makes sense. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-28-we-should-do-more-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I bought a little box of tomatillos from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them.
Suggestions so far include:
 fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa raw tomatillo salsa a la Rick Bayless fried with onions and then add to scrambled eggs for tortillas baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti in pastel de Montezuma  What I ended up making was a very simplified version of Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos, reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-tomatillo/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at times system called Zemanta.
