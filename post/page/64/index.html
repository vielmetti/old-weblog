        <p>From President Obama in his memo to the heads of federal agencies: A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency.&#0160; As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”&#0160; In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government.&#0160; At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-01-26-president-obama-on-the-freedom-of-information-act/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One of my very favorite weblogs from Michigan Tech is the aptly named Backyard Arthropod Project: A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI, which is written in a style that a professional metallurgist and amateur entomologist can do.&#0160; It&#39;s hosted on somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com . This week&#39;s post is a very lovely photo set of a Canadian Tiger Swallowtail butterfly.&#0160; The account of the identification of the Papilio canadensis is accompanied by a story of how it was collected, footnoted of course, with this note about the use of the word &quot;snarge&quot;: [2] I just heard this word on the news recently, as a direct result of the airliner that had to ditch in the Hudson river when its engines both quit, possibly due to birds getting sucked into them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-01-24-snarge-somethings-sticking-to-my-windshield/">&raquo;</a></p>
