        <p>North Quad at the U of Michigan had a flood today, causing classes to be cancelled and students to be evacuated from their rooms. There is no estimate of the damage at this time, but it's extensive.
The University of Michigan School of Information has a flood information page with reschedule and relocate information for classes and talks.

        <p>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them.

Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network.
It's OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-28-a-slow-moving-version-of-twitter-always-hand-write-your-tweets-before-sending-them/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Do I understand this? No. But this is a blog called Vacuum, and this is my service to that task.
Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-27-from-physorg-ephemeral-vacuum-particles-and-the-fluctuating-speed-of-light/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things.
The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down.
The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-25-open-every-tab-close-every-tab/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you, like me, are interested in how systems work and when they fail, here are three good sources to look at from the internet persective on global network behavior.
The outages mailing list (outages at outages.org) describes itself as follows:
 The primary goal of this mailing list (&quot;outages&quot;) is for outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-outages-cable-failures-and-postmortems-sources-for-information/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly.
The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-being-partially-online-is-worse-than-either-being-online-or-being-offline/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time.
Both SleepBot (http://mysleepbot.com/) and SleepTime (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone's accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you're not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-two-sleep-tracker-applications-for-android-sleepbot-and-sleeptime/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it.
The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-21-onetab-a-chrome-extension-to-reduce-system-memory-usage/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I haven&#39;t had a working smart phone in months, and so the times when I find myself needing to write down short messages to the world don&#39;t always coincide with the times that I&#39;m on the net. Hence this version of &quot;pocket twitter&quot;, writing down things that you want to share (or to remember) on paper, and saving that paper away until the next time it&#39;s possible to share a photograph. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-pocket-twitter-a-suitable-replacement-for-the-internet-when-offline/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>GriefNet&#0160;is an Internet community approach to on line grief support, providing support to people working through loss and grief issues of all kinds. Cendra Lynn is the leader of the organization, and I had some small technological part in starting it back in 1993 when the appropriate technology of the day was Gopher, not the World Wide Web. The system hosts dozens of moderated mailing lists for people who share a common loss like the death of a spouse or the loss of a child. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-griefnet-support-for-grief-death-and-major-loss/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on http://am1610.org . The show is &quot;The Strait&quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&#39;s always worth a listen.&#0160;
Some day I&#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-the-strait-am-1610-the-station-detroit-electronic-vinyl-on-saturday-nights-10-pm-to-midnight/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If my Google Analytics reporting is to be behaved, the peak of Google Reader usage for me was in mid 2008, and by early 2010 it had been reduced to background noise. I can understand based on this graph (and perhaps millions of other graphs like it) that it might be time to call it quits.
It looks like from other charts (that I won&#39;t show here) that Twitter picked up the slack, as did Facebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-13-ill-miss-google-reader-but-its-no-longer-how-people-read-this-site/">&raquo;</a></p>

The thesis is that if enough of your friends drop off of a service, you will too, because you won&#39;t have anyone to talk to.

        <p>I&#39;m slowly but surely reducing the number of people who I have listed as &quot;friends&quot; on Facebook. That doesn&#39;t mean that I have less&#0160;fewer&#0160;&quot;friends&quot;, but just that I&#39;m tiring of reading updates from people who I barely know as though I were a real-life friend of theirs.
This ends up being a slow and tedious task since the user interface doesn&#39;t have an easy one-click unfriend from a long list - instead you have to go to each stranger-friend in turn, select a drop-down menu, and scroll to the bottom of it to make your &quot;friendship&quot; go away. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-02-friendship-fleeting-and-permanent/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&#39;s really quite simple to open up a Hubbard squash or any other big tough squashes.
Put the squash in a paper bag, lift it up high, and let it drop onto a hard concrete floor. I went down to the basement and dropped it from the ceiling. Once the squash has been cracked open, it generally can be cut into further smaller pieces without much ado.&#0160;
The various suggestions to hit the thing with an axe, a mallet, or other sharp or blunt instrument, or even to use a knife to start the process are quite inefficient compared to the wonderful force of gravity that can be at your command in this process. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-02-24-how-to-cut-open-a-hubbard-squash/">&raquo;</a></p>
