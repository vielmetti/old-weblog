Here&#39;s a snapshot from mid-afternoon ; the base map grid shows the most commonly used routes. The system began in Minneapolis two years ago.

        <p>Washington, DC is getting a new Metro map, and some new services.

The full Metro map is here, in all its PDF glory; the sample below is hoped to be a reasonable size.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds! I used the Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-washing-machine-hose-leak-repair/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Change your LinkedIn password. News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak/">&raquo;</a></p>

It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course.

        <p>Some notes for this evening&#39;s transit of Venus across the Sun. University Lowbrow Astronomers has a page full of Venus transit information for Ann Arbor area locals, including viewing parties at local observatories and at the Traverwood Library. The Great Lakes Association of Astronomy Clubs has a similar list of Venus transit viewing sites statewide if you want to meet up with others while watching. Depending on your location, the 2012 transit will take place either June 5 or June 6. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-05-transit-of-venus-viewing-opportunities-near-ann-arbor-on-june-5-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do. Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-04-the-problem-with-unreliablenetworks-is-that-you-have-to-engineer-extra-hard-to-be-able-to-make-use-of-them-and-you-still-ca/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-29-forking-the-cookbook/">&raquo;</a></p>
