        <p>Microcoworking is independent workers and freelancers working together at the same time in a coffee shop, sharing ideas and conversation. It&#39;s more informal than the coworking facilities that have sprung up all over the country, but it shares with them the idea that just because you&#39;re working on your own you don&#39;t have to be alone.

        <p>According to Facebook, none of my friends have a birthday today. How many friends do I have to have so that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that there will be a birthday every day of the year?
An answer comes from the blog Math Goes Pop!, referencing the well known &quot;coupon collector&#39;s problem&quot;.
What’s known about this problem? Well, as I said above, even if you buy hundreds of thousands of cards, or stuff millions of people in a room, there’s no guarantee that you’ll collect every card or every date. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-25-happy-birthday-to-no-one-not-today-a-birthday-problem/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is a corollary to Steve Fuller&#39;s observation
 Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.
 It&#39;s worse than that, of course - the system that has the goods is something you used to understand, but don&#39;t anymore, and thus you are ignorant about the very expertise that you once had.

A spill on this pipeline near Milwaukee led to it being shut down for a time this week, and even though the pipeline is back in operation, the effects linger in the form of a fuel shortage in the UP. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-24-july-2012-west-shore-pipeline-spill-leads-to-upper-peninsula-energy-emergency/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Photo: Valerie Everett, Flickr
The 2012 Michigan hay crop is not looking good, due to widespread drought conditions. From Michigan State Extension:
 The dry weather of 2012 has left most livestock producers in the Midwest scrambling for more hay. First cutting hay yields were down 20 – 40 percent in much of Michigan and with the dry weather intensifying, total hay yields for the year could be off by 50 percent or more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-24-2012-michigan-hay-crop/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for Kedgeree - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.
 2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee 1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt, pepper fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch hard boiled eggs for garnish  The method runs roughly as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-20-kedgeree-or-something-quite-similar-to-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&#39;s going on in real time. This is helped by the live simulcast of Ann Arbor City Council meetings on CTN, the city&#39;s cable access television feed, as well as online.
There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-17-tracking-the-ann-arbor-city-council-with-the-a2council-hash-tag-on-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.
The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-08-new-to-me-at-least-for-80s-music-on-the-radio-play-30-year-old-casey-kasem-top-40-countdown-shows-exactly-as-originally-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

 June 26, 2012 — The University of Virginia&#0160;Board of Visitors&#0160;today voted unanimously to reinstate Teresa A. Sullivan as president.
University Rector Helen E. Dragas apologized for actions that sparked the controversy and pledged that she will work with Sullivan to capture the energy from the events of the past three weeks to address the issues confronting the University.

As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.
There&#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-26-jobs-in-ann-arbor-a-list-of-links-to-employer-web-sites-on-arborwiki/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.
&quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-21-the-universal-authority-on-authorities-from-second-hand-knowledge-patrick-wilson/">&raquo;</a></p>
