    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This is breaking news, and this blog post will be out of date. The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River has collapsed near Mount Vernon, Washington. A map shows where the incident happened, about half way between Seattle and the Canadian border. As of this writing there are no confirmed details about the cause of the bridge collapse. The Seattle Times says it may have been because an oversized truck hit the bridge with its load. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-23-i-5-bridge-over-the-skagit-river-collapses-in-washington-state/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>That&#39;s the word from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt: Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&#0160; That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after the peonies start but before the u-pick strawberries are ready.

        <p>Here are some notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of May 22, 2013. They are in no way reflective of everything that was discussed at the meeting; indeed, there&#39;s some things here that we didn&#39;t talk about at the meeting that I discovered later. But here goes anyway. 1. How does Bitcoin work? I&#39;m looking at the Khan Academy series on Bitcoin and listened to one lecture which seems to spell it out quite well. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-22-introduction-to-bitcoin-notes-from-the-michigan-bitcoin-meetup-of-52213/">&raquo;</a></p>

Rawsonville: Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm has an active Facebook page, and doesn&#39;t yet have details of when first harvest will be. Their strawberries survived earlier frost scares. No U-Pick raspberries this year. &#0160;UPDATE: Rowe&#39;s will open for the season on June 8, berries&#0160;$1.78 per pound.

        <p>I wrote an early review of Contactually, and I signed up for their pro service after the trial period expired. I used the system for a couple of months, but have decided to back down from the pro version back to the free version for a while. Here are some reasons for that. First and perhaps foremost, Contactually is relatively expensive at $20/mo. I looked at what I was spending (or not spending) on other internet services that I use and like. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-12-giving-up-on-contactually-for-now/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From Mat Honan, on Tumblr: Generation X is a journeyman.

It didn’t invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing.

        <p>You run a library; it gets donations, from time to time, of books or other materials. Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age? One approach is the &quot;virtual bookplate&quot;, described in this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida.

AIR is noted for its awarding of the prestigous Ig Nobel awards, rewarding achievements that&#0160;&quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;.

        <p>From Systemantics, the systems bible: While Systems-people share certain attributes in common, each specific system tends to attract people with specific sets of attributes. For example, people who are attracted to auto racing are likely to be people who enjoy driving fast, tinkering with high-powered cars, and beating other people in fierce competition. The System calls forth those attributes in its members and rewards the extreme degrees of them. But a word of warning is in order.&nbsp;A priori&nbsp;guesses as to what traits are fostered by a given system are likely to be wrong. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-08-systems-attract-systems-people/">&raquo;</a></p>
