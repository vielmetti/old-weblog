            <p>UPDATED Thursday June 13, 6:00 p.m MT with new maps at the top.
The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-11-black-forest-fire-near-colorado-springs-colorado-with-map/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain. A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-10-writing-to-remember-writing-to-forget/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m fond of TuneIn, a free service that lets you tune in to radio broadcasts from all over the world. I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel.
One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&#39;s playing now and who&#39;s playing whom. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-10-tunein-listen-to-broadcast-radio-from-all-over-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Some notes on a 30th high school reunion, written last summer but just now published.
There&#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.
Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-08-some-notes-on-a-30th-high-school-reunion/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.
The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-08-how-did-i-meet-you-how-do-i-know-you/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A few highlights, not the whole talk.
My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.
For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.
Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;followers&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; as the actions often reciprocated. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-04-some-notes-from-a-lunchtime-talk-on-social-media/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        
            <p>Yesterbox is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.
The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.
Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-on-summarization/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.
I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-hacker-news-summary-monday-27-may-2013-300-pm-edition/">&raquo;</a></p>
