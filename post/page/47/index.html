If you were at West Park during the recent monsoon rains you&#39;ll appreciate that quite a bit of work went into stormwater handling, with very visible results.

        <p>The input box on Twitter is very small, the user interface works on a cell phone, and it all feels so much like you are having a small intimate conversation with a few confidants. Something horrible is said and you and perhaps the world realize that this thing is not just a harmless lark.&#0160;
Twitter is a global communications infrastructure, with short meaningful names that replace carrier-assigned numbers for text and picture messaging. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-14-lack-of-discretion-is-the-better-part-of-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.
The power outage maps I have been collecting started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &quot;dial by twitter name&quot; in the sense that there&#39;s no command line prompt that has a &quot;call&quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object.
 % call @vielmetti

        <p>The weekend is a low email diet, but somehow that&#39;s difficult to do without explaining myself a little bit. Here&#39;s some thoughts as to how I might do things the next time that I work through the world of weekend time, how I can get some more effective communications rather than just more frequent.
Short asynchronous private message. A Twitter direct message works nicely for this, as does an SMS message. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-noemail-alternatives/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>&quot;Sisyphus had it easy.&quot;
I&#39;ll be off email starting Friday night and continuing to Sunday night; the second weekend in a row of a &quot;no email&quot; weekend. It wasn&#39;t quite 100% offline the first weekend, since I&#39;m so addicted, but I made a point of not clicking on any messages in my inbox and not sending any mail.
Part of the plan for not doing email is making sure that at the end of the time you can recover gracefully and not feel overwhelmed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-noemail-recovery/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From The Unknowledge Pattern Language, on Nooron:
 Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&#39;t know about the elements, until we &quot;filled in the blanks.&quot; These &quot;named voids&quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-unknowledge-management/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&#0160;
The Twitter input box doesn&#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&#39;t pop for it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-09-my-great-weird-ideas-dont-fit-in-140-characters/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Update June 8, 2011: the Howes Lake Wildfire has been contained. Here is a wildfire map, from the Michigan DNR. See also an incident action plan (PDF), 8.5 x 11&quot; version of this map, and an area map for reference.
News stories, many of which have photos: Andrew Keller at UpNorthLive: &quot;Families go home&quot;
 The firefighters looked exhausted today, but those men and women were still at it, making sure this fire wouldn&#39;t pick back up and damage would stay at 817 acres. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-07-howes-lake-fire-grayling/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s collected reports from the places that I&#39;m on mailing lists for U-Pick strawberry season for 2011 near Ann Arbor. Comments welcomed. &#0160;The June 2011 &quot;strawberry moon&quot; (full moon) is June 15.
Whitaker&#39;s Berry Farm in Ida, MI (about 30 miles S of Ann Arbor.)&#0160;opens Thursday, June 9, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. U-Pick $1.30/#, $3.25/qt prepicked. &#0160;&quot;Those wanting real large amounts for canning and freezing, may wish to wait until closer to June 15th, which is when peak season should begin. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-07-michigan-2011-u-pick-strawberry-season/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;ve written about Supermemo before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&#39;t overwhelm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-06-supermemo-spaced-repetition-and-structured-randomness/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The a2b3 group met at Eastern Accents this Thursday, June 2, 2011. Here&#39;s a summary of sorts.
I took notes in a quadrille notebook   for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-a2b3-meeting-non-summary-june-2-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning that Jim Tressel has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&#39;s leadership of the program, culminating in an NCAA investigation.
For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the Dead Schembechlers. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&#39;s best to have a &quot;holy rivalry&quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &quot;New Wolverine Order&quot;, the &quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&quot;, or the &quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-30-tressel-dead-schembechlers/">&raquo;</a></p>
