            <p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck.
The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-27-writers-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Some weaselly-looking character from an outfit called "Just Energy" knocked on our door today. They are of course scam artists and we just tell them we are not interested. They are very pushy and actually try to mislead people into thinking they have something to do with the utility companies. The especially like to prey on the elderly.

            <p>I've started using Meetup.com to organize several groups. Here's some notes.
For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the a2b3 group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the a2b3 meetup which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-24-notes-on-meetup/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back.
The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.
Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:
 AllRecipes adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing Epicurious replaces the mayo with heavy cream and adds some chopped parsley and mustard Boston Organics follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint The Floating Kitchen adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt Martha Stewart dresses the slaw with olive oil and lemon juice and skips the mayo Edible Twin Cities adds some fennel to the salad  I could continue but this is enough meta-information to head to the kitchen. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-21-kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw-a-study-in-comparative-literature/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.
The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-19-retrieving-foia-logs-a-study-in-contrasts/">&raquo;</a></p>

The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-18-an-active-if-diffuse-media-ecosystem/">&raquo;</a></p>
