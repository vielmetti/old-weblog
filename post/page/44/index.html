        <p>The UARS satellite is making its way back to earth. Here's some parts of the ways to track it. (Think of it as research for your next disaster movie.) On Twitter, the #UARS hash tag has a lot of traffic. I'm following @UARS_Reentry and @NASA and that's enough to get the summary information. Heavens Above has an orbital display with current location information; you'll need to refresh periodically.

        <p>Facebook is changing, again; that&#39;s not really news, since it seems to change all the time. Some people will like it, some people will hate it, and for the most part people will get used to it since they always seem to. I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view. The 2011 hurricane season crisis map from Google&#0160;has the first large scale version of a multi-utility outage map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-07-combined-east-coast-power-outage-tracking-map-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated. Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-23-hurricane-irenes-path-forecasts/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Perhaps, if I find the answers in someone else&#39;s code, I won&#39;t have to play the darned game anymore. It turns out that the game is NP-hard; the The Complexity of Flood-Filling Games&#0160;(from&#0160;Raphael Clifford,&#0160;Markus Jalsenius,&#0160;Ashley Montanaro,&#0160;Benjamin Sach). I don&#39;t feel so bad about it any more.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next. Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-17-what-to-write/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There is an instinct, when things go bad, to want to make sense of the situation by putting the fragments of information that you have on a map. Things are going badly around London tonight, and several people are making sense of it the best they can with maps of what is being reported on Twitter as #londonriot. I&#39;m keeping links to the original sites here, but the maps I&#39;m including are not live embedded versions - click through for those - but rather snapshots of a moment in time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-08-august-2011-london-riot-maps/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A trip to the Goodwill store in Marquete, MI prompted an examination of their media collection. I ignored the piles of CDs, skipped the shelf of LPs, and went to the bin that had cassettes and 8-tracks. For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;. On the video shelves, there were plenty of 1990s vintage VHS tapes and a whole shelf of VHS players stacked up. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-08-08-dead-media-live-on-8-track-version/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own. The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism&#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks. Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-29-cyberspace-is-gone/">&raquo;</a></p>
