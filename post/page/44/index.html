    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?
There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-31-on-non-disclosure-and-keeping-trade-secrets/">&raquo;</a></p>

To really test, get a Gopher client; I am using Overbite Chrome from Floodgap Systems.   Thanks to Cameron Kaiser for noticing, and to&#0160;Maciej Ceglowski for making it happen.

The organization announced its new web site, northburnspark.org , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources.

 Enough smoke was generated by the fire that residents of the nearby Woodbury Gardens complex called for help, and trucks from Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township were seen departing the scene. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-07-fire-harpst/">&raquo;</a></p>

 This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-29-nickel-plate-765-steaming-through-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>

I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">&raquo;</a></p>
