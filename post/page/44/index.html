    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?
There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-31-on-non-disclosure-and-keeping-trade-secrets/">&raquo;</a></p>

Did you see them? The Northern Lights were visible from Ann Arbor at about 10:30 p.m. on October 24, 2011, described by Julie Weatherbee as "giant red areas like someone had set off a red smoke bomb".

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>In 2008, I wrote about how to make a Halloween vacuum cleaner costume, with attachments. I know that Halloween is coming every year when people start to find that post.
Go there to look at it (now; thanks) and then some more ideas:
Read Engelbert Sneem and his Mean Vacuum Machine, a 2007 kids picture book by Daniel Postgate from North-South Books.
@zephyrbunny on Flickr has a photo set to build a Roomba costume. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-07-vacuum-cleaner-costume-ideas-for-halloween-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

Quince caramel from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-01-october-2011-recipes-quince/">&raquo;</a></p>

 This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-29-nickel-plate-765-steaming-through-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>

Heavens Above has an orbital display with current location information; you'll need to refresh periodically.

I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&#39;t want to see them again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-23-facebook-changes-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.
