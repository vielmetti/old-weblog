 Ann Arbor&nbsp;â€” Former Michigan Supreme Court Justice Diane Hathaway pleaded guilty Tuesday to bank fraud and could face up to 18 months in prison.
Hathaway negotiated a guilty plea with federal prosecutors and waived her right to indictment or trial.

            <p>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013.
From NPR, the FAA is grounding 787s because of battery problems:
The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston.
What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, according to the Seattle Times: <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-17-boeing-787-batteries-ablaze-aloft-lithium-ion-battery-fire-risk-grounds-aircraft/">&raquo;</a></p>

A piece of it is also &quot;how do other people find it when they&#39;re looking for it&quot;, but for this exercise it&#39;s the personal search pattern and not the global search pattern that matters.
My current workflow admits multiple patterns for doing this, and I suspect that the answer to my question is to do more than one save, depending on how important it is to save something. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-15-storing-something-somewhere-you-can-remember-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &quot;social graph&quot;. Techmeme&#39;s front page has plenty of commentary.
I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:
 For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-15-graph-structured-rolodex/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system.
Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &quot;item&quot;) and the subsequent responses. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-11-a-modern-version-of-confer-ii-some-thoughts-on-communication-system-structure/">&raquo;</a></p>

A typical example:
Dexter Patch writes a story about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station.
