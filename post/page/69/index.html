        <p>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&nbsp; From the Australian Newsagency Blog Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston. At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season. At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on a more unique range of titles. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-03-calendar-of-the/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>#gno stands for &quot;Girl's Night Out&quot;.&nbsp; It's trending right now on search.twitter.com.&nbsp; (Yes I am up late; but this is fascinating, I've never seen this particular behavior on twitter before.) Sometimes you'll see topics trend on search.twitter.com when there are a lot of hipster people in some hipster city at some hipster tech conference.&nbsp; A zillion people who are all mostly in the same building will use the same tag to post comments on the event.&nbsp; At this point that's &quot;ordinary&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-01-gno-organizing/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A friend asks, &quot;when did the Internet go commercial&quot;?&nbsp; Here's something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can. 1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds 1989: Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider. 1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic. 1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet 1991: MSEN goes online as one of the first commercial ISPs in Michigan.&nbsp; 1993: ANS CO+RE joins CIX The paper Internet Cost Structures and Interconnection Agreements goes into (too much) details about how the money flows between commerical networks; it is a viewpoint from 1995 of the Internet then.&nbsp; But basically I'd put a date as August 1991 when you could buy an internet connection from one commercial provider and use it to send data to a customer on another commercial provider and not violate any acceptable use politics along the way. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-30-when-did-the-in/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Bubble wrap!&nbsp; Who knew. Build It Solar has the super-easy instructions, which involve cutting the wrap to the size of the window, spraying a thin film of water on the window, and letting the bubble wrap stick.&nbsp; Add a little glycerin perhaps if you have trouble removing it in the spring. It's apparently a common practice in the greenhouse industry. And it's more transparent and high tech than duct taping some foam insulation to the window. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-30-how-to-insulate/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We have a patch of land that should be doing something productive but instead is growing Japanese Knotweed.&nbsp; I'd like to fix that. The simple description of how to deal with it seems to be to smother the affected area (using tarps or old carpets) and to do container gardening on top of that ground cover.&nbsp; (ref about.com) It's time to think about it now, because I know that come May, it'll be growing with wild abandon. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-30-how-to-get-rid/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For a bunch of reasons which I don't completely understand, there are gasoline shortages in the Atlanta area. The net is responding by using the #atlgas tag on Twitter to coordinate real time information about the location and availability of gasoline.&nbsp; To look at it the easiest way is through the twitter search for #atlgas.&nbsp; Some recent examples - wheelmom: #atlgas BP at I-85 and Clairmont. $4.39(!)

        <p>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&nbsp; I'm looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you'd get in &quot;petabytes per container&quot;. The answer appears to be &quot;about one petabyte per six linear feet of container&quot;, or put another way, &quot;about one petabyte per ten cubic meters of containerized storage. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-25-storage-density/">&raquo;</a></p>
