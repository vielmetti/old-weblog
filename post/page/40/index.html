SEMOLINA PUDDING
Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup milk
4 cups water
grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)
1 cup semolina flour
cinnamon
raspberries or other berries
Directions:
Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-31-semolina-pudding/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:
 The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#0160;&#0160;
 I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-30-the-business-model-is-hamsters-generating-less-money-with-each-turn-of-the-wheel/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-29-forking-the-cookbook/">&raquo;</a></p>

Something new
One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-20-beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The early reports from strawberry growers that send out periodic newsletters to their perennial customers is that Michigan strawberries will be early this year. If you normally plan to pick on Father&#39;s Day, you may be too late for the crop.
None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&#39;ll share those when I have them; it&#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-15-michigan-strawberries-are-early-in-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.
There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;smart grid&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-10-power-outage-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.
For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-09-i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Tonight&#39;s Ann Arbor City Council meeting discussed at great length the expenditure of some sizable sum of money for art that would be installed in the secured lobby of the Justice Center part of City Hall, where would you have to go through a security check to visit it.
What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-08-on-public-art-in-public-places-in-ann-arbors-city-hall/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-01-im-not-producing-content-im-writing/">&raquo;</a></p>
