    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&#39;s hope the repair holds!
I used the Family Handyman&#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine&#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-washing-machine-hose-leak-repair/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Change your LinkedIn password.
News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &quot;LinkedIn&quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-linkedin-has-had-a-password-leak/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say &quot;It is yet more difficult than you thought.&quot; This is the muse of form. It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-wendell-berry-the-real-work-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Two views of the Wisconsin recall election, in which Governor Scott Walker (R) survived a challenge from Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett (D). With 93% of precincts counted, Walker leads 54% to 45%.
The&#0160;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel results map&#0160;shows who won which county:

TheNew York Times coverage also shows the margin of victory, which puts the map into stark relief:

Compare this with theless clear Huffington Post interactive recall results margin graphic, which shows percentage size of lead on a county by county basis; that over-weights the color of rural counties, and underestimates the size of the urban difference in the total vote count. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-06-wisconsin-recall-election-results-2012-in-graphics/">&raquo;</a></p>

University Lowbrow Astronomers has a page full of Venus transit information for Ann Arbor area locals, including viewing parties at local observatories and at the Traverwood Library.

        <p>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&#39;t rely on them even when you do.
Consider the network connection that&#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-04-the-problem-with-unreliablenetworks-is-that-you-have-to-engineer-extra-hard-to-be-able-to-make-use-of-them-and-you-still-ca/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>There&#39;s a great song by The Horse Flies, called &quot;Roadkill&quot;, with the memorable line &quot;eat what you kill&quot;. This is from their live show at the Grassroots Festival, 1993:

You&#39;ll find more Horseflies tunes on the Internet Archive from their live shows. Look for their other seasonally appropriate tune &quot;I live where it&#39;s gray&quot;. I haven&#39;t yet heard their latest album Until The Ocean.

        <p>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:
 The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#0160;&#0160;
 I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-30-the-business-model-is-hamsters-generating-less-money-with-each-turn-of-the-wheel/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-29-forking-the-cookbook/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some sources for information on the Duck Lake Fire, which started on Wednesday, May 23, 2012 and is burning rapidly in Luce County, north of Newberry, MI. The fire is dangerous and has caused evacuations; if you are reading this and you are in the area, seek authoritative and current information from official sources.
The fire brings to mind the 2007 Sleeper Lake Fire&#0160;which burned over 18,000 acres in Luce County. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-25-duck-lake-fire-north-of-newberry-mi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Andrew Keen&#39;s Digital Vertigo is a follow-on to his earlier The Cult of the Amateur. Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at Facebook and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful.
With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-22-digitalvertigo-by-ajkeen-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Imagine that it&#39;s the year 2020; it&#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?
Something new
One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-20-beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The early reports from strawberry growers that send out periodic newsletters to their perennial customers is that Michigan strawberries will be early this year. If you normally plan to pick on Father&#39;s Day, you may be too late for the crop.
None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&#39;ll share those when I have them; it&#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-15-michigan-strawberries-are-early-in-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.
There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;smart grid&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-10-power-outage-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.
For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-09-i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error/">&raquo;</a></p>
