        <p>December 30, 31 2013: Two BNSF trains collided about a mile west of Casselton, North Dakota, setting the crude oil that one of them was carrying on fire. The toxic plume of smoke from the fire has led to evacuations of the city, which is 25 miles west of Fargo. The fire's black smoke is visible from space, as seen in the GOES satellite image below. Meteorologist Aaron White: The smoke plume from the train collision was large enough that it could be seen on the visible satellite imagery just before sunset. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-31-trains-collide-in-casselton-north-dakota-leading-to-giant-fireball-and-toxic-fire/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy of something I've already written and published somewhere else. That ensures that in some way I'll be able to find it, probably by googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into the ether too quickly (including this thread which will die quietly when we are all done with it). Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don't really provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic discussion. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-30-facebook-where-its-hard-to-keep-a-conversation-going-and-find-it-again-later/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The ice storm of late December 2013 hit the Lansing area hard, and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting outages as well as citizens would have them do. The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL, the Lansing Board of Water and Light. Even though the surrounding area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing, LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively unusual in this day and age. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-29-lansing-michigan-lbwl-crowdsourced-power-outage-map-of-29-december-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

From parking garages to sidewalks, Vielmetti is plugged in to the home of the Wolverines. He shows us how working with public documents should extend beyond federal fiddlings and can really have an impact on a local community.

        <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite". The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-the-first-draft-of-this-essay-was-140-characters-or-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious). The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-spicy-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-salad/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Toronto, Ontario is coated in ice tonight. A severe winter ice storm slowing the city to a slippery crawl, with widespread power outages. It's a city in crisis. Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it's a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford. A tale of two different worlds: One a joke and the other reality: @TOMayorFord and @TOMayorFrod The later proving the difference. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-22-a-tale-of-two-toronto-mayors-tomayorfrod-and-tomayorford/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On the Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index: The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness. The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-21-ice-storm-of-december-21-22-2013-and-the-sperry-piltz-ice-accumulation-index/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything. For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-18-facebook-and-obituaries-part-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I use OneTab (see: previously) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook.
