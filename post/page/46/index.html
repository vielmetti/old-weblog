        <p>A fascinating account of how Zappo&#39;s improved the quality of reviews on its site by hiring Mechanical Turkers to correct spelling and grammar. From Behind the Enemy Lines
 An online retailer noticed that, indeed, products with high-quality reviews are selling well. So, they decided to take action. The retailer used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of the reviews posted on its own website. Using the&#0160;Find-Fix-Verify pattern, the retailed used Mechanical Turk to examine&#0160;millions&#0160;of product reviews. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-14-comments-will-henceforth-be-edited-for-spelling-and-grammar/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I can't help myself to think of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle when considering the new Google+ system and how it organizes people into circles. The circle, properly constructed, is a "karass", the people who you are following around and around. The pivot of the karass is a "wampeter", the thing which draws you together - "a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail". <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-13-cats-cradle/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Part of the fun of Google+&#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &quot;circles&quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&#39;s private groups). It&#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-10-nine-circles-of-googleplus/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.
In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like Radio Reference, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-08-newsroom-vs-newsroom/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>In summary, the train will be late, and it will be later than you had previously expected it to be late because of delays on the line due to the track owner (Norfolk Southern) restricting the speed of the track user (Amtrak). &#0160;See Amtrak Train Status History for details.
 More discussion is scattered around the net; I found a good thread at this RailroadFan.com site (&quot;Norfolk Southern cuts train speeds&quot;) with some discussion of the various rail infrastructure in the area including the three NS paths from Detroit to Chicago (via the Wabash and via Toledo) making the more direct Michigan Central line less critical for freight use. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-07-how-late-will-the-train-be-tracking-amtrak/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I was away from my computer for a few days, but still near my Blackberry - a not-so-smart smartphone with a rudimentary web browser that is reminiscent of the finer parts of web browsing circa 1995. It&#39;s even better than 1995 in that the browser is so portable that it can go with you everywhere, and thus can be reasonably expected to be a mobile companion on social network outings. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-05-social-networks-the-mobile-phone-experience-via-blackberry/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Disclaimer: I have just now gotten access to Google+, so this review is a reflection of other reviews, some personal experience, and a weary view of novelty.
Google+ is out in very limited test. Some small number of well connected people now have access to a new piece of social software from Google, and initial reviews have been generally positive.
How do you assess whether the initial reviews of a system designed for communications are accurate for when the system eventually gets rolled out to a wider audience? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-30-google-early-reviews-the-new-software-smell-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I&#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s played.
First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including Walker Tracker, Steps, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-28-walking-around-a-new-urban-walking-game/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.
Some background for context.
The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-26-top-of-mind-vs-top-of-page/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After a rough winter, potholes are ubiquitous on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.
The technology to repair a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">&raquo;</a></p>
