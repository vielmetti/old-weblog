    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at discardia.com. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1. For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-summer-2011-discardia-notes/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>After a rough winter, potholes are ubiquitous on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes. The technology to repair a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-potholes/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Prediction markets provide a nice, idealized way to use market mechanisms to predict the future. They are a slightly idealized version of an office betting pool and allow small scale bets (real or virtual) on future events. Unlike a real futures market, where you can get guarantees of future performance on things like delivery of gasoline or frozen orange juice, there&#39;s no way that betting on some prospective GOP hopeful will lift your candidate to office. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-23-prediction-markets/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&#39;s Day at Rowe&#39;s in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly. The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-20-strawberry-season-2011-report/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&#39;s, ALS, etc.). One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a diversity of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-20-neurodiversity/">&raquo;</a></p>

While it&#39;s clear the LED lights use less energy, it&#39;s not always obvious that they cost less to install and operate for the duration of their expected lifetime.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The poll is provided through All Our Ideas, which unlike most other polling software is actually useful for writing in that it lets readers come up with their own suggestions and not just pick from a pre-packaged list. If you are wondering what to cook for dear old Dad, last week's Pancakes? poll might give you some recipe ideas. It generated 21 ideas with over 200 votes. &nbsp; <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-14-fathers-day-take-our-poll/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>More Father&#39;s Day events! West Park had a major construction project over the last year, and it&#39;s now being unveiled complete with a grand ribbon cutting and the unveiling of the sculpture in the park. If you were at West Park during the recent monsoon rains you&#39;ll appreciate that quite a bit of work went into stormwater handling, with very visible results. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-14-west-park-grand-opening-june-19-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The input box on Twitter is very small, the user interface works on a cell phone, and it all feels so much like you are having a small intimate conversation with a few confidants. Something horrible is said and you and perhaps the world realize that this thing is not just a harmless lark.&#0160; Twitter is a global communications infrastructure, with short meaningful names that replace carrier-assigned numbers for text and picture messaging. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-14-lack-of-discretion-is-the-better-part-of-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for. The power outage maps I have been collecting started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I find myself wanting to call people once in a while, and I also find that I know people&#39;s twitter names pretty well. What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &quot;dial by twitter name&quot; in the sense that there&#39;s no command line prompt that has a &quot;call&quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object. % call @vielmetti Actually, I&#39;m at even a worse spot; I don&#39;t even have a &quot;call&quot; command to start from at the shell script prompt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-dial-by-name-using-the-twitter-name-space/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The weekend is a low email diet, but somehow that&#39;s difficult to do without explaining myself a little bit. Here&#39;s some thoughts as to how I might do things the next time that I work through the world of weekend time, how I can get some more effective communications rather than just more frequent. Short asynchronous private message. A Twitter direct message works nicely for this, as does an SMS message. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-noemail-alternatives/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>&quot;Sisyphus had it easy.&quot; I&#39;ll be off email starting Friday night and continuing to Sunday night; the second weekend in a row of a &quot;no email&quot; weekend. It wasn&#39;t quite 100% offline the first weekend, since I&#39;m so addicted, but I made a point of not clicking on any messages in my inbox and not sending any mail. Part of the plan for not doing email is making sure that at the end of the time you can recover gracefully and not feel overwhelmed. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-noemail-recovery/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From The Unknowledge Pattern Language, on Nooron: Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&#39;t know about the elements, until we &quot;filled in the blanks.&quot; These &quot;named voids&quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-unknowledge-management/">&raquo;</a></p>

The list is known to be incomplete, but the list from Wikipedia (outage management system) is also incomplete.
