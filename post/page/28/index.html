    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>People in Urbana Illinois are up in arms that the Urbana Free Library director decided to discard a large portion of the library&#39;s non fiction collection. Shelves were left bare after books older than 10 years old were summarily discarded. Citizens, up in arms after their library collection was decimated, packed a library board meeting to demand answers. Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-bookgate-in-urbana-illinois-at-the-urbana-free-library/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been trying to keep up a daily pace to blogging here; that&#39;s been my habit for almost ten years. The problem is that it&#39;s not always easy to know what to write about. I&#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-when-you-have-no-idea-what-to-write-use-randomness-in-your-favor/">&raquo;</a></p>

This led to widespread power outages, with a total of more than half a million subscribers affected.

Less than $100 spent, and the computer no longer starts to thrash when I have more than a few windows open.

        <p>As reported in the Ann Arbor Chronicle: A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers. An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn. The two councilmember speaking turns per question are proposed to be reduced from five to three minutes, and from three to two minutes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-16-ann-arbor-city-council-to-consider-restricting-public-comment-time/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I have a fickle relationship with reminder systems. Usually the drill is to discover something new, vigorously dump everything I can possibly think into it, and then slowly but surely get disillusioned with it as time goes on. The smell of a new system is seductive, and when something new comes along there&#39;s a tendency to look at its good side and to focus on the bad parts of whatever you were using before. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-16-evernote-for-android-as-a-reminder-system/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>UPDATED Thursday June 13, 6:00 p.m MT with new maps at the top. The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost.

        <p>This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain. A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-10-writing-to-remember-writing-to-forget/">&raquo;</a></p>
