        <p>Polls are fun ways to get people&#39;s opinions, and the All Our Ideas website is a particularly good form of this polling because it lets readers add their own suggestions.
As an introduction to this, here&#39;s a simple poll: what are good ways that you suggest to meet new people? You&#39;ll get a choice of two from the list to pick which one is better, and if you have a better idea you can add it in. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-09-good-ways-to-meet-new-people-take-our-poll/">&raquo;</a></p>

Some of the best brief accounts are on Twitter, using the various hashtags #TOflood, #floodTO, #TOstorm, #stormTO, and #darkTO.

 The 10,000 lb. gorilla of birthdays is Facebook, which offers a nice simple interface to send a one-line birthday greeting.

        <p>The&#0160;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is a secretive organization, but it does have a web site. Now Eric Mill (@konklone) is tracking that site&#39;s every change.
His first writeup of it describes version one of a tracking system:
 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, responsible for overseeing the US government&#39;s foreign surveillance activities via FISA, actually does have a&#0160;public website. They seem to have just created it, as it doesn&#39;t have any documents from before June of 2013, and the Wayback Machine&#0160;has no record of it&#0160;prior to that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-07-watch-the-actions-of-the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court-with-fisacourt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>What do you use for an address book on your computer or mobile phone, and are you happy with it? I have the sense that there could be much better tools for collecting useful scraps of information about your correspondents, but nothing I&#39;ve seen recently answers the nagging feeling that we could be doing better with this.
The two apps that I have seen that do something different in this space are Evernote Hello and Brewster. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-03-what-do-you-use-for-an-address-book-on-your-computer-or-mobile-phone-and-are-you-happy-with-it-i-have-the-sense-that-there/">&raquo;</a></p>

A Greasemonkey script to remove the Yahoo eyebrow uses Javascript. A key element reads
 document.getElementById(&#39;eyebrow&#39;).style.display = &#39;none&#39;; A second approach uses Adblock Plus&#0160;to wipe out the ads for Yahoo services; note, you might have to buy into a lot more than just blocking this ad if you go that route.
A third route uses CSS to hide the offending elements; I saw it fly past this a. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-02-how-to-hide-the-flickr-yahoo-eyebrow-toolbar/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Vacuum's subject material is a hodgepodge, but that's because Vielmetti sees the blog very much in the classical context: as a personal, yet very public, journal. A longtime notebook keeper, Vielmetti sees Vacuum mostly as just another way to record and archive his own thoughts--although it recently hit a traffic milestone, with one million total page views.
 Patrick Dunn's story also has accounts from A2Gastroboy, Ben Connor Barrie of Damn Arbor, and Mark Maynard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-30-the-power-of-the-blog-ann-arbor-observer-june-2013-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Several streets in Ann Arbor have flooded as a result of slow-moving storm cells that passed through the city on the afternoon of Thursday, June 27, 2013. Reports are still filtering in, but here&rsquo;s what I know about right now.
The City of Ann Arbor is building a “Citizen Storm Corps” volunteer group to assist in stormwater/flooding data collection. Volunteers will visit Large Event Data Gathering locations after significant rain events, record visual observations about the stormwater&rsquo;s behavior at that location using a LEDG Stormwater/Flooding Reporting Form, and submit the data to the city. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-27-june-27-2013-flooding-in-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>

Some examples may be useful.

Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-bookgate-in-urbana-illinois-at-the-urbana-free-library/">&raquo;</a></p>

I&#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-when-you-have-no-idea-what-to-write-use-randomness-in-your-favor/">&raquo;</a></p>
