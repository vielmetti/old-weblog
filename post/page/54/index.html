        <p>I wanted to write something short and pithy and insightful for Facebook or Twitter or some other minimalist thing and couldn&#39;t come up with anything. &#0160;The ultrashort format is not suited to ruminations on things you don&#39;t completely understand and are trying to work out in the process of writing about them. Instead I will go for a walk.

        <p>I used this phrase in my meaningless indicators of progress post. Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context: Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called The Art of Living Mindfully on the work of Ellen Langer. Her blog is not frequent but it is thoughtful. We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless.

If there ever was a lore around it, it circulates among a group of people who I don&#39;t know. &#0160;The owner of the store was notable in his day, but that day is about 60 years ago. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-25-the-frailty-of-human-memory/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Metblogs was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content. From Metblogs series finale: [U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-23-the-end-of-metblogs/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.

        <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet.

        <p>The season of discardia is upon us again. &#0160; It&#39;s time to unsubscribe from mailing lists, take out the trash, empty out your pockets, weigh your inbox and reduce its weight, clean out the cupboards and more. It&#39;s also time for me to stop even pretending that I can follow everything that have at one time been interested in and let some things that fascinate me slip by the wayside for a while, so that in some future I can come back to them and be surprised by how much progress has been made since I was gone. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-20-discardia-runs-20-mar-2010-14-apr-2010-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As part of a &quot;town fauna&quot; series on AnnArbor.com, I wrote this piece on a muskrat rescue by a 4th grade group on a field trip to a water treatment plant.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one. In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-finding-buckets-to-refill-regularly/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant. Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-meaningless-indicators-of-progress/">&raquo;</a></p>
