        <p>Metblogs was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content. From Metblogs series finale: [U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and weâ€™re closing the doors at the end of May. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-23-the-end-of-metblogs/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts. I had to hit &quot;shift-refresh&quot; to force everything to load.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-03-converting-vision-into-reality-dont-give-the-whole-thing-away-in-the-first-meeting/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one. In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-finding-buckets-to-refill-regularly/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant. Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-meaningless-indicators-of-progress/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've changed the title of this blog back to Vacuum, since all of the extra gobbledygook was making it hard to bookmark things. The "quick compose" part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don't have titles, so I don't get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type. Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-02-05-ive-changed-the-title-of-this-blog-back-to-vacuum-since-all-of-the-extra-gobbledygook-was-making-it-hard-to-bookmark-things/">&raquo;</a></p>
