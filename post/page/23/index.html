 Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.
Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.
“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-28-2013-is-a-record-apple-crop-for-michigan-growers-but-migrant-labor-is-hard-to-find/">&raquo;</a></p>

The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to spend money to replace them.
To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at council about the state of the lighting, I'd like to make this request. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-23-foia-inspection-reports-for-downtown-ann-arbor-street-lights/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.GOV, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?

Reuters took a look at the issue, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.
 Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-06-slow-obamacare-registration-denial-of-service-attack-or-self-inflicted-injury/">&raquo;</a></p>
