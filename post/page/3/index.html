        <p>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that I&rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.
The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&rsquo;re likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were trying to do in the first place. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-the-productity-oscillator/">&raquo;</a></p>

Hi Ed,
My name is Michael and I work at Nextdoor.
Recently it has come to our attention that there isnâ€™t a Nextdoor for your neighborhood, and that you have registered in a nearby Nextdoor neighborhood. Thank you for your interest in joining Nextdoor and becoming part of your community on our website. However we do need people to register at their real addresses, as it helps us add a sense of accountability, security and transparency to the website. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-kicked-out-of-nextdoor/">&raquo;</a></p>

There are 272 inspections for October 2015 and 50 more for November 2015 available.

        <p>The first snow of the 2015 season for Ann Arbor happened today, November 21. The forecast is 6 to 10 inches.
Roads are slippery, and there are reports of a number of crashes and cars in the ditch on area freeways. I&rsquo;m listening to the Washtenaw scanner on Broadcastify and it&rsquo;s a steady stream of road run-offs.
Farmers Market was busy but snowy. Holiday greenery was well in evidence. We picked up smoked lake trout, cabbage, garlic, rapini, and a cookie and a donut for my market companions. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-21-first-snow-of-the-season/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container.
I&rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &ldquo;stable&rdquo; branch.
Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task, with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&rsquo;s docker-openvpn is what I&rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from jpetazzo/dockvpn which solves the same problem slightly differently.
There&rsquo;s a tutorial on Digital Ocean that describes the setup including client-side support. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m thinking about deleting my LinkedIn account.
I was an early adopter of LinkedIn back when it first got started. It was interesting, fun, cool to collect all your friends.
Now, my sense is that my LinkedIn profile is useless at best and actively unhelpful at worst. Why would I want to publish a standardized autobiography of work experience in a medium that doesn&rsquo;t reward complicated life histories? It&rsquo;s not helpful - what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s not clear that it&rsquo;s ever been helpful for the narrowly defined task of getting work. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-18-can-i-give-up-on-linkedin-yet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Melting Pot in downtown Ann Arbor is closing as of today, November 16, 2015, according to a post on the restaurant&rsquo;s web site and a story in MLive.
The last regular inspection of The Melting Pot by the Washtenaw County Health Department was on May 26, 2015. It turned up 11 violations, and some of them would be the sort of problems that would make you not want to go back. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-melting-pot-closing/">&raquo;</a></p>

Washtenaw County Health Department. I&rsquo;m temporarily stymied in my quest to determine how often restaurants ask the county to change their inspection reports before they are published. An initial request came back with an estimate of $6000 to comb through every file in the department; an amended request looking for only 30 days of records only limited the cost to $1000. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-foia-update/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&rsquo;t have a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable response is &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;.
There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&rsquo;s attainable for less than $6100. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

It&rsquo;s always worrisome to look at a project that has very few issues, because that&rsquo;s usually a signal that no one else is using the code.

Slack is a shiny new system also providing multi-channel, multi-network chat.

        <p>CubicSDR is a software defined radio system for Mac, Linux, and Windows. It&rsquo;s at version 0.1.4-beta as of August 28, 2015, and you can download the binaries from https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4 or the source code from Github at https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR .
My point of comparison for software defined radio is GQRX. When you put CubicSDR on the screen it has a very pretty waterfall display and relatively easy to sort out mouse commands, but it&rsquo;s lacking some of the fancier controls that a more mature program like GQRX has accumulated over time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/">&raquo;</a></p>
