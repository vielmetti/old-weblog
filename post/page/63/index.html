 THE STORY OF MAD-STONE
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-12-the-story-of-madstone-w-r-sanner-fort-worth-tx-1886/">&raquo;</a></p>

Here&#39;s build notes for that, with the caveat that I am not 100% satisfied with it just yet, and it will probably get another tweak for the next preso. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-slightly-delayed-back-channel-for-meetings-with-twitter-tweetdeck/">&raquo;</a></p>

The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags. As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event:
There&#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member Stephen Rapundalo, who&#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-ann-arbor-plastic-bag-ban-vote-postponed/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>noted on Geert&#39;s blog
IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network!
Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friends’ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)! <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-03-ipv6-over-social-network-a-facebook-application-for-routing-packets-over-friend-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I stumbled into a world of &ldquo;parking advocacy organizations&rdquo; (trade associations for parking structure operators) and this video about how a garage in California is using per-space lights and sensors to speed up the process of people finding parking in a structure that&rsquo;s mostly full.
The parking rhetoric in Ann Arbor is that a structure is full if it&rsquo;s at 85% capacity, based on one consultant&rsquo;s recommendations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to challenge that and say that no one really cares how full a garage is if you know that you won&rsquo;t be frustrated finding a space. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-01-where-is-the-nearest-free-parking-space-how-to-fill-parking-structures-at-more-than-85/">&raquo;</a></p>

Rich Hall played him on Saturday Night Live - a clip I can't find right now - and also in this 1987 Showtime special I found on Youtube.   Time Magazine's obituary talks a bit about the Rich Hall piece on SNL: A salesman for himself and his vision of the American dream, he was also a master peddler of many products, whose makers were as loyal to Harvey as his listeners. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-28-paul-harvey-as-played-by-rich-hall-1987/">&raquo;</a></p>

Frozen blueberries are selling at a steady clip, but carryover stocks from 2008&rsquo;s crop are still huge, according to industry experts.
Sales seem to have picked up speed late last year, with warehouse stocks falling by 4 percent in October, 6 percent in November and 7 percent in December 2008, according to the USDA&rsquo;s National Agricultural Statistics Service. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-26-frozen-blueberry-price-report-eastern-washinton-blueberry-workshop-march-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Slate&#39;s&#0160;Farhad Manjoo&#0160;wonders what the fuss was all about of the Internet of 1996:
I started thinking about the Web of yesteryear after I got an e-mail from an idly curious&#0160;Slatecolleague: What did people do online back whenSlate&#0160;launched, he wondered? After plunging into the&#0160;Internet Archive&#0160;and talking to several people who were watching the Web closely back then, I&#39;ve got an answer: not very much.
Once you get past the &quot;oh ha ha dancing cats&quot; attitude of the article, you discover that the preserved online record of the World Wide Web circa 1996 is incomplete (at least as seen via the Internet Archive) and there&#39;s really not that much to explain why people were interested in it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-25-borrowed-nostalgia-for-the-unremembered-90s-at-slate/">&raquo;</a></p>

Someone asked me for advice on how to get invited to speak at conferences. &#0160;Key advice:
 become a valuable participant in a niche field, grow along with the niche, become a good speaker.   &#0160;&#0160;There&#39;s more, of course; there&#39;s always more; it&#39;s a good discussion of how he found a growing niche and helped popularize it in part by viewing things from a novel perspective. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-24-how-to-get-invited-to-conferences/">&raquo;</a></p>
