            <p>Discardia is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&#0160; It&#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.
Priority one is a book purge; I&#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-21-discardia-for-spring-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

 THE STORY OF MAD-STONE
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-12-the-story-of-madstone-w-r-sanner-fort-worth-tx-1886/">&raquo;</a></p>

Here&#39;s build notes for that, with the caveat that I am not 100% satisfied with it just yet, and it will probably get another tweak for the next preso. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-slightly-delayed-back-channel-for-meetings-with-twitter-tweetdeck/">&raquo;</a></p>

The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags. As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event:
There&#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member Stephen Rapundalo, who&#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-ann-arbor-plastic-bag-ban-vote-postponed/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>noted on Geert&#39;s blog
IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network!
Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friends’ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)! <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-03-ipv6-over-social-network-a-facebook-application-for-routing-packets-over-friend-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I stumbled into a world of &ldquo;parking advocacy organizations&rdquo; (trade associations for parking structure operators) and this video about how a garage in California is using per-space lights and sensors to speed up the process of people finding parking in a structure that&rsquo;s mostly full.
The parking rhetoric in Ann Arbor is that a structure is full if it&rsquo;s at 85% capacity, based on one consultant&rsquo;s recommendations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to challenge that and say that no one really cares how full a garage is if you know that you won&rsquo;t be frustrated finding a space. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-01-where-is-the-nearest-free-parking-space-how-to-fill-parking-structures-at-more-than-85/">&raquo;</a></p>

Rich Hall played him on Saturday Night Live - a clip I can't find right now - and also in this 1987 Showtime special I found on Youtube.

I started thinking about the Web of yesteryear after I got an e-mail from an idly curious&#0160;Slatecolleague: What did people do online back whenSlate&#0160;launched, he wondered? After plunging into the&#0160;Internet Archive&#0160;and talking to several people who were watching the Web closely back then, I&#39;ve got an answer: not very much.
Once you get past the &quot;oh ha ha dancing cats&quot; attitude of the article, you discover that the preserved online record of the World Wide Web circa 1996 is incomplete (at least as seen via the Internet Archive) and there&#39;s really not that much to explain why people were interested in it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-25-borrowed-nostalgia-for-the-unremembered-90s-at-slate/">&raquo;</a></p>

 become a valuable participant in a niche field, grow along with the niche, become a good speaker.   &#0160;&#0160;There&#39;s more, of course; there&#39;s always more; it&#39;s a good discussion of how he found a growing niche and helped popularize it in part by viewing things from a novel perspective. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-24-how-to-get-invited-to-conferences/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m just going to keep posting about blueberries until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be summer again; I think we have a few tubs still in the freezer.
The search is for a blueberry muffin recipe with cardamom, and here&#39;s some sample of same, to see what the variety is in the recipes so that perhaps some meta-recipe will emerge.&#0160; Do be sure to read the first one through; it&#39;s a moving memorial and a story of how we celebrate the end of someone&#39;s life. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-20-blueberry-muffins-with-cardamom-some-recipes-in-the-hopes-that-summer-will-arrive/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>This bit of an exchange from a mailing list has been stuck in my inbox for more than a year, time to post it.&#0160; It was about Chi.mp, a &quot;content hub and identity management portal&quot;.
People using Chi.mp will have identities that are importable, exportable, interoperable, portable and most importantly theirs. 
and I can&#39;t help but think of this from the magazine In Formation #2, part of the late dot-com era: Every day computers are making people easier and easier to use. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-19-identity-microformats-and-the-self-as-seen-on-the-net/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>from an AAPS press release
Superintendent Todd Roberts and Deputy Superintendent Robert Allen will be hosting two sessions to give staff, parents, students and community members an overview of the district’s budget planning for the 2009/2010 school year.
Tuesday, March 3 , 7-9pm at Scarlett Middle School, 3300 Lorraine
Thursday, March 5 at 7-9pm Forsythe Middle School, 1655 Newport
If you want to review how the schools got to this point, you can go back to a 2007 AAPS budget crisis meeting with a presentation by Robert Allen on the financial challenges visible then. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-18-ann-arbor-public-schools-2009-budget-forums-march-3-and-march-5/">&raquo;</a></p>
