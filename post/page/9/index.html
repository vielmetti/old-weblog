        <p>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn't have school and so I didn't actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine. The first piece of the new routine is getting to the Ann Arbor YMCA. If the weather is nice and I don't have anything else going on, it's a nice bike ride; if I'm making a car trip into town for school, it's close enough to be a good next stop. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-04-13-daily-telegraph-a-new-routine-with-the-argus-farm-stop-and-the-ann-arbor-y/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>After three or four years of planning to get Skywarn training, this year I finally did it. The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio. After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-30-plane-spotting-some-quick-notes-on-a-new-software-defined-radio-setup/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My Twitter feed was full of air crash news this morning. Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all passengers aboard. Wikipedia has a good summary, perhaps as good as any. What was unusual about the crash was that there was no distress call, and that the plane descended rapidly and steadily into the ground without veering once from its course. Of note in this regard is another European flight on a similar aircraft some months earlier. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-24-the-mysterious-crash-of-4u9525-germanwings-flight-9525-in-the-french-alps/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman's Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones. The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-24-whats-the-most-expensive-parking-space-in-ann-arbor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>First made in 2002, these old candybar style phones are virtually indestructible. My son popped my Ting SIM into it and it's working fine. Not so my old Nexus 4, which did a face plant on the sidewalk, cracked the screen and screwed up the digitizer. It dates only from 2013. I'll price out fixing the Nexus 4, but I suspect it's not going to be worth repairing. (We'll see.) And then there's the question of what kind of device do you want to carry around with you all the time, how much you want to spend and whether it makes sense to retreat to simpler technology for a while until the answer is more clear. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-18-my-new-old-phone-is-a-nokia-3390b/">&raquo;</a></p>

I first got word that there was a chance of northern lights from the Michigan VHF-UHF Society mailing list, an amateur radio group. When the aurora activity is high, the VHF amateur radio bands (2 meter and 6 meter) get increased range, so ham radio operators with this interest keep an alert out. The Aurora Page at Michigan Tech has a lot of useful links to space weather forecasts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-18-northern-lights-in-northern-michigan/">&raquo;</a></p>

I know it won&rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies have at least one county that they only provide service to part of), but as a start it&rsquo;s a pretty good one. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-04-cleaning-polygons-in-r-and-shapely/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've been fond of maps and graphs for a long time, but haven't had a good set of tools to play with that easily generate decent versions of same from various data sets I've found or accumulated. The small hope is that a little bit of hacking on the right tools will fix this. One of the tools of choice is R, a language for statistics and data analysis. It's tremendously powerful and a bit complicated, but I'm not trying to learn the whole thing; rather, I'm after just the barest minimum so that I can competently generate a scatterplot of data and place it onto a map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-28-r-me-hearties/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my favorite weather forecasts comes from forecast.io. This screen shows the ensemble set of forecasts they have for temperature for tomorrow (February 20, 2015), highlighting the 8:00 a.m. reading. You'll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is RAP from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Looking at their set of pages they have a nice cold temperature forecast map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-20-super-cold-but-sunny-dont-forget-that-it-was-sunny/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don't ask me why.) Here's some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more. First, some prior art. How to make a tactile compass feedback belt is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-02-15-designing-a-wearable-magnetic-sensor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it's cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate. I thought I'd use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch. The setup: Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag.

        <p>Vellum closed in January 2015. The Ann Arbor News story tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was "like a laboratory", and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run. What's missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum's menu at the outset used the "sous vide" cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-12-vellum-a-downtown-ann-arbor-restaurant-has-closed/">&raquo;</a></p>

Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning. The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-01-05-ann-arbor-city-council-highlights-for-5-january-2015-a-preview/">&raquo;</a></p>
