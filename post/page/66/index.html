            <p>While waiting for the AATA&#39;s mobile ridetrak system to go back online (it&#39;s been down for two weeks now due to a series of unfortunate events), I&#39;ve been thinking about how to model the network of bus and pedestrian routes so that you could say some useful things about the goodness of a given route network for a particular task at a particular time of day.&#0160; What I&#39;m after is understanding just how far I can reasonably go from where I am to somewhere else useful based on bus routes, my willingness or ability to walk, and the minute by minute information about how late the bus is. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-23-the-bus-game-why-its-important-to-get-the-aatas-mobile-ridetrak-back-online/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;Twitter zero&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, Dunbar number and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-23-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

The vendor&#39;s web site, TSC, says

serendipity in book-finding: (via if:book)
the pinpoint accuracy of computer-searches, leaves those of us lucky enough to have spent time in library stacks, nostalgic for the unexpected discovery of something we didn&#39;t know we were looking for but which just happened, serendipitously, to be on a nearby shelf.

A new book on its way on the post-automotive era; quoting their release page in its entirety.
After the Car By: John Urry (Lancaster University) and Kingsley DENNIS.    Description It is difficult to imagine a world without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next few decades. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-15-after-the-car-john-urry-and-kingsley-dennis/">&raquo;</a></p>

 &quot;Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes&quot;
 Pocket ore docks are monumental structures used to transfer iron ore from railway cars traveling from nearby mines to ships that carry the ore to steelmaking centers or transfer points on the Lower Great Lakes. These structures were constructed from wood, steel, or reinforced concrete. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-14-pocket-docks-of-the-great-lakes-patrick-cooleybeck-paper-at-the-society-for-industrial-archaeology-d/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>LONG-LOST OPERATIC FRAGMENT COMES TO LIGHT
 During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music community even this crumbling shard of Verde&#39;s never-performed Il Internetto. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-08-il-internetto-a-fragment-of-an-unfinished-work-by-giuseppe-verde/">&raquo;</a></p>
