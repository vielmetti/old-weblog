        <p>How do you organize materials such that they don't get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it's hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world. I'm noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I'd have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-keeping-up-with-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Another device on my shopping list is a Chromecast. This is a $35 or so HDMI dongle (powered by USB) that feeds video from your computer to a screen. How does a Chromecast work?

        <p>I won't be complaining about a small keyboard or a small screen for a while, but I have a lot of tools to reinstall on a new system. In order of appearance: Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there's a working full-screen mode. git comes with the machine, so I didn't have to install it; it's a big part of making sure that stuff gets version tracked. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-that-new-computer-smell/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Github is not much fun on a very small screen. Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn't so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone. None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki. Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-github-on-the-very-small-screen-is-not-much-fun/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-the-daily-birth-and-death/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up. For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-falling-behind-slowly/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Pete Kaminski pointed me to this essay on archetypes in computer gaming, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming. What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-hearts-spades-clubs-diamonds-and-bots/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The tone of Michigan football blogs has changed since the loss to Minnesota on Saturday. Before the game there was a lot of grumbling, but it was varied; no one single issue stood out. After the game, it was much more clear. A series of plays saw the second string Michigan quarterback, Shane Morris, get hit hard on his head. Morris is seen exhibiting signs of a concussion. Yet in an unfortunate sequence he goes back into the game after sitting out one play on the sidelines. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-28-a-blow-to-the-head-but-back-in-the-game/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The revolution will not be blogged. It will be twittered or facebooked or elloed or plurked, but blogging is not a revolutionary activity in the new era of the net. The process of writing for your own web site and then announcing that you have something new to say to the world is perhaps the least efficient way of getting news to the world. It is so much easier and more efficient to drop that news inside a walled garden of publishing and have it ricochet quickly inside the walls. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-28-the-late-age-of-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>At some point in the life of a project it is inevitable that an obstacle comes up that makes you wonder whether your enthusiasm for the effort is well placed. Do you redouble your efforts, or do you take a break, or do you simply refocus and find something else to zero in on for the moment? Sometimes a bit of distance can help, at least temporarily. Rather than exit in flames with a tattered manifesto flapping on the door in your wake, just go quiet for a while. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-27-the-risk-of-misplaced-enthusiasm/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once, and it stuck. A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-27-do-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>How do you produce so much writing? It is simple. All you have to do is sit down every single day and write. There is nothing like a daily deadline to focus the mind. Weblogs do not impose an external deadline. No editor is asking you when your work is going to be ready, and no producer is going to feed you copy. It is just you up against the elements, bravely typing away alone and hoping that your focus is not distracted by systems problems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-26-write-every-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Did I just complain about address books? Well let me complain again. My addressbook asks for a random() function. It needs to surprise me from time to time, showing me individuals who aren't going to show up in a search, but who nonetheless are worthy of remembering right now. My addressbook needs a search by location function, so that I can pan and zoom over geography and figure out who I know where and who's nearby enough but not in the same city. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-25-a-random-walk-through-the-address-book/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My address book fails me, in that it does not have any same way to encode the best way to reach someone. Should I just call? Is it best to confirm that you are not busy now? Do you so instant message, Twitter DM, some other single purpose system that you are always available on? Should I revert to email to schedule something for later? It is always appropriate to send a postcard, but I have not figured out how to make that an instant process, not that it really wants to be. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-25-smile-and-dial/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I am operating with the limitation that I do not currently have a full sized keyboard and screen. The laptop accidentally ingested a cup of coffee. It is getting dried out and the bad bits reclaimed now, and in the meantime I am doing all my computing on either library computers or my Nexus 4 phone. It is often awkward to compose messages and to write on such a small screen, but the screen size is not really the problem. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-23-the-limits-of-the-small-screen-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a design for a low overhead way to post about events coming up in Ann Arbor. Follow @a2events on Twitter if you want to play along. The first rule of business is that every event has to have a URL, and the more simple and direct the URL is the more likely it is that it's authoritative for the event. If an event doesn't have a URL yet, I'll blog about it here if I need to post about it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-13-a-design-for-an-an-ann-arbor-events-channel-a2events-/">&raquo;</a></p>
