        <p>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too.
Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don't have enough oomph to take on an Internet's worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-internet-of-things-world-hasnt-condensed-into-a-single-system-and-because-of-its-origins-its-unl/">&raquo;</a></p>

This outage map from about 7:00 p.m. that evening shows the extent of the damage.

        <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-bee-app-a-multiplatform-issue-tracker-client-for-mac/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Editorial debt accumulates when the passage of time makes a document less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.
For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-accumulating-editorial-debt-and-dealing-with-out-of-date-text/">&raquo;</a></p>

I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting.

        <p>How do you organize materials such that they don't get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it's hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world.
I'm noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I'd have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-keeping-up-with-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Another device on my shopping list is a Chromecast. This is a $35 or so HDMI dongle (powered by USB) that feeds video from your computer to a screen.
How does a Chromecast work? See Tom's Guide for a primer. I was sold on the idea because it let me cast my Android's screen to a big monitor without any fuss of cables and wires. Genius! <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-chromecast/">&raquo;</a></p>

In order of appearance:
Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need.

        <p>Github is not much fun on a very small screen.
Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn't so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone.
None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki.
Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-30-github-on-the-very-small-screen-is-not-much-fun/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-the-daily-birth-and-death/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.
For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-falling-behind-slowly/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Pete Kaminski pointed me to this essay on archetypes in computer gaming, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.
What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-hearts-spades-clubs-diamonds-and-bots/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The tone of Michigan football blogs has changed since the loss to Minnesota on Saturday. Before the game there was a lot of grumbling, but it was varied; no one single issue stood out. After the game, it was much more clear.
A series of plays saw the second string Michigan quarterback, Shane Morris, get hit hard on his head. Morris is seen exhibiting signs of a concussion. Yet in an unfortunate sequence he goes back into the game after sitting out one play on the sidelines. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-28-a-blow-to-the-head-but-back-in-the-game/">&raquo;</a></p>

The process of writing for your own web site and then announcing that you have something new to say to the world is perhaps the least efficient way of getting news to the world. It is so much easier and more efficient to drop that news inside a walled garden of publishing and have it ricochet quickly inside the walls. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-28-the-late-age-of-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At some point in the life of a project it is inevitable that an obstacle comes up that makes you wonder whether your enthusiasm for the effort is well placed.
Do you redouble your efforts, or do you take a break, or do you simply refocus and find something else to zero in on for the moment?
Sometimes a bit of distance can help, at least temporarily. Rather than exit in flames with a tattered manifesto flapping on the door in your wake, just go quiet for a while. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-27-the-risk-of-misplaced-enthusiasm/">&raquo;</a></p>
