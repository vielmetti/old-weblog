        <p>Achieving Extraordinary Organizational Performance Through Diversity
Professor Scott Page, University of Michigan
Friday, November 21, 1-2:15 p.m.
Founders Room, Alumni Center

Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&#39;s predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&#39;re talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why diversity trumps ability. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-20-scott-page-on-diversity-and-organizational-performance-november-21-2008/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Hot on the heels of the Tea Fire comes word of another big fire in Los Angeles, the Sayre Fire. Here's the news sources I was able to round up quickly; no doubt this will be changing fast.
LAFD suggests these social media tags and channels:
 Twitter hashtag: #LAFIRE Flickr tags: "SayreFire" and "LAFD" and add to LAFD Photo Pool YouTube tags: "SayreFire" and "LAFD"   Los Angeles Fire Department: Fire update 6am Sat PST; Fire evacuation map; Los Angeles DWP: Major power lines taken out of service Blog: LAist - power shut off by DWP;&nbsp; freeway closure map; Newspaper: LA Times - overview with map and videos  Television: KABC 7 live video Radio: KNX 1070 CBS news radio Hospital: Olive View Hospital in path of fire (LA Times) Metrolink: Antelope Valley Saturday service cancelled Twitter: following LAist, Metrolink, LAFD  I'm particularly looking for news about Reseda (family in the area). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-15-sayre-fire-los-angeles/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>on time tracking, in general, an observation from last year:

It&#39;s hard to have great weird ideas when you&#39;re tracking every minute to determine who it gets billed to. The cognitive overhead of deciding which part of your brain gets dinged for each good thought gets in the way of flow.
My days have a lot more specific time points where something needs to happen at a certain time, no compromises. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-13-on-tracking-the-minimum-aliquot-of-attention/">&raquo;</a></p>

Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-12-describing-wiki-to-the-expert-user-of-microsoft-word/">&raquo;</a></p>

Tinotopia was blocked for a while, which got the author riled up enough to document some of the failures.&#0160; No entries since April 2005:
