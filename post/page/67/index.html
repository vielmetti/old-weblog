        <p>Part of a Wiki Wednesday series; this post is NOT FINISHED but I needed to post it anyway. Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-12-describing-wiki-to-the-expert-user-of-microsoft-word/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Holiday traffic is seasonal, and we are in the post-Halloween, post-election, pre-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas season now.&#0160; Just look at the typical retail display which is already showing holiday stuff. Based on a study of the last three year&#39;s worth of traffic to this blog, here&#39;s some things you can anticipate me writing between now and the end of November, in part because I&#39;ll write it down because I need to know it, and in part because it&#39;s just that time of the year.&#0160; A wildcard that I don&#39;t have is any long experience with a political transition, so I&#39;ll throw in something in that slot. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-11-november-outlook---key-words-themes-trends/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Quite a few cafe networks have filters set up to block various kinds of use.&#0160; My usual failure modes with these are that they mark perfectly reasonable internet services as inappropriate. Here&#39;s a litany of Panera complaints, to give you a feel for it. Tinotopia was blocked for a while, which got the author riled up enough to document some of the failures.&#0160; No entries since April 2005: In this case, Tino of all people is the loser: for he has once again been suckered into coming into Panera only to find that the network is kaput. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-10-great-wall-of-panera-what-do-corporate-cafe-wifi-networks-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Along with all of the other t-shirts (Michigan Beer Pong, Michigan Undecided) for sale on State Street before football games, a new one has appeared this year:&nbsp; &ldquo;2008 Worst Season Ever&rdquo;. Not being one to quarrel with a t-shirt, I thought I&rsquo;d go back through history and see just how bad this year&rsquo;s team is compared to teams of the past. 1.&nbsp; Rich Rodriguez has the worst lifetime record (2-7) of any Michigan football coach.&nbsp; The nearest benchmark is the 1891 team, coached by Mike Murphy and Frank Crawford, who coached for one season with a 4-5 mark.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The last years in modern times to have a two win season are 1962 (Bump Elliot) and 1958 (Bennie Oosterbann&rsquo;s last year).&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; In 1934 and 1936, Harry Kipke coached to a 1-7 record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry Kipke has a street named after him, notes the Hoover Street Rag, and the late Gerald Ford was MVP of the 1934 team.&nbsp; Ford wrote a chapter in What It Means To Be A Wolverine which is worth a read about just how difficult a year that was. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-07-worst-season-ever---michigan-2008-football/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Coffee House Coders is a programmer&#39;s group that meets Wednesday nights at ERC State St in Ann Arbor.&#0160; A large long table in the back hosts a dozen or so laptops, and the assembled crowd works on whatever code they are working on. Organized by Zach Steindler and Matt Pizzimenti, this group when I visited last week was mostly current and recent UM engineering students, with a few people from out of town visiting old friends.&#0160;&#0160; I saw a demo of a new product under development by Occiptal, which looked kind of like Doom set in cities, designed to run on a mobile phone.&#0160; At Coffee House Coders I learned about CouchDB, an object database which has an interesting data model - throw JSON objects into a big flat store, and retrieve them with Javascript map/reduce functions.&#0160; My favorite Django person, Brian Kerr, pointed me at a tutorial on how to implement a hierarchical database in this system. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-05-coffee-house-coders-wednesdays-9pm-11pm-eastern-espresso-royale-cafe-state-st/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly part of the same easy to define train of thought. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;note to self&rdquo;, or &ldquo;note to future self&rdquo;, for the sorts of things that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again. It&rsquo;s notes about places I&rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&rsquo;d like to go to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get interested enough in something to write down what I find out about it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that find it (and more) so I can learn more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-05-note-to-self-on-organizing-communicating-and-noting-for-the-future/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the delicious tag polenta, from the blog Hungry Cravings - the so called Cheater Method Polenta. The critics were skeptical: Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck! but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-01-baked-polenta-no-stir-polenta-sounds-like-no-water-soup---possible-but-unlikely/">&raquo;</a></p>
