        <p>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week's a2b3 meeting.&nbsp; Here are some things people shared. Many people were using Google Calendar for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-how-do-you-keep/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need. The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-coping-with-com/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you'd be surprised how many people apply who haven't any connection at all). The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there's no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile.&nbsp; That makes the workflow very clumsy and slow. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-20-fixing-linkedin/">&raquo;</a></p>

View Larger Map It needs better icons so you don't have to decode the color chart.&nbsp; Typically prices can vary $5 from week to week depending on the game, and if all goes well it will rain on a Thursday so that the golf course is closed and thus neighborhood parking is at a premium. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-19-michigan-footba/">&raquo;</a></p>

The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I'll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.&nbsp; So the Y stop becomes an 11 stop, since the bus is supposed to get there at 11 26 41 56. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-18-link-bus-2008-m/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As seen in the Duke University news: Little Teeth Suggest Big Jump in Primate Timeline DURHAM, NC -- Tiny fossilized teeth excavated from an Indian open-pit coal mine could be the oldest Asian remains ever found of anthropoids, the primate lineage of today's monkeys, apes and humans, say researchers from Duke University and the Indian Institute of Technology. Just 9-thousandths of a square inch in size, the teeth are about 54.5 million years old and suggest these early primates were no larger than modern dwarf lemurs weighing about 2 to 3 ounces. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-anthrasimias-gu/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I've told you once, I've told you 146 times: repetition is the very soul of the net. SuperMemo is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.&nbsp; His 1992 masters thesis, Optimization of Learning, covered the early work on Supermemo and a discussion of spaced repetition in learning. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-supermemo-repet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota. From a profile of Jim Johnson by writer Cheryl Reitan in the mnartists.org site: JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-03-jim-johnson-poe/">&raquo;</a></p>
