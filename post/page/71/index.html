    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Party like it's what year?
The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-24-financial-panic/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans Fabricius) on September 7, 2008.&nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System's Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.
The best news article on this is from the Greenville, MI Daily News, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-22-very-rare-south/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn't find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&nbsp; &nbsp;
The &quot;bunny cutter&quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-12-bunny-biscuit-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.
This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This recipe is much too easy this time of year when tomatoes are in abundance and taste great; don't even think of doing it with winter styrofoam tomatoes.
Sauce:
A little olive oil
Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller
Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh
Heat the olive oil in a pan.&nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don't bother to skin or peel or seed them. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-07-anelletti-alla/">&raquo;</a></p>

Write for yourself. Really, you are best off with an audience of one to start, and use your time and effort to write down things that you will want to read in a week or a month or a year. If you are interesting to your audience of one, you have some hope of being interesting to some other person somewhere else on the planet who is interested in you. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-06-bloggers-secret/">&raquo;</a></p>

If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.
Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging.
The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic.
By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">&raquo;</a></p>
