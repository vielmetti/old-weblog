One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.
This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.
Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging.
The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic.
By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a video of the Warren Easton HS marching band in New Orleans, LA:
  This is a band that was basically wiped out by Hurricane Katrina, and Bart notes their restart in 2006 after Katrina.
Like a lot of people we are watching from afar for the projected path through the Gulf of Gustav to hope it isn't a repeat.&nbsp; Unlike Katrina, this time around there's twitter; see the twitter stream of people talking about Gustav. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-28-warren-easton-h/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This blog loads very, very slowly.&nbsp; (Sorry.)&nbsp; It's big, it's full of weird crap that I like to post because it's interesting, and sometimes things break because the weird crap is no longer supported.
If you want it to go faster look at this:

        <p>Google's AdSense program is designed to provide relevant targeted advertising content to web pages.&nbsp; It works, sometimes intermittently, on weblogs - but there's often enough other non-relevant things on the design of those pages to work only indifferently.&nbsp; What you do find however is that the appropriately targeted wiki design - especially one where the subject matter expertise of a professional association is involved, and where the words in use a specific to a field of specialty - yields extremely targeted results. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-26-google-adsense/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week's a2b3 meeting.&nbsp; Here are some things people shared.
Many people were using Google Calendar for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-how-do-you-keep/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you'd be surprised how many people apply who haven't any connection at all).
 The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there's no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-20-fixing-linkedin/">&raquo;</a></p>
