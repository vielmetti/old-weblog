    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Whenever the power goes out, there's a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on. Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what's going on - there's a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.&nbsp; With hurricanes on their way, and dozens of different electric companies dealing with possible problems, it looked like a mess.&nbsp; So I made a map. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-03-power-outage-ma/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>While it's still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net's response to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; I'm not putting a lot of links in this post. -- Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter looked like an actual help here for the folks I knew, both to help let others know where they were going (or whether they were staying) and to help make the evacuation process somewhat less isolating.&nbsp; &nbsp; Evacuation path: Those who left relatively early had relatively easier driving; by the time evacuation was underway in earnest the traffic jams were huge, some gas stations were temporarily out of gas, and the contraflow caused a lot of congestion when it ended.&nbsp; Twitter again seemed to be useful to help people figure out which non-Interstate highways looked like reasonable exit paths, or at least if it wasn't useful at that moment it was something to file away for next time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">&raquo;</a></p>

Many people were using Google Calendar for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-how-do-you-keep/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&nbsp; I asked the question &quot;How do you keep your calendar&quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need. The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you're invited).&nbsp; &nbsp;So somehow there needs to be a growth strategy that absorbs new people in but that doesn't expect all 280 people on the email list to show up weekly because I know that they never would fit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-21-coping-with-com/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It's getting to be that time of year when the streets are crowded with eager fans looking for a place to park for Michigan football.&nbsp; Here's a list of blogs covering the 2008 season - not complete and not in any order - for reference. mgoblog starts preseason blogging in earnest next week.

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you'd be surprised how many people apply who haven't any connection at all). The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there's no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile.&nbsp; That makes the workflow very clumsy and slow. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-20-fixing-linkedin/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>These are projected, estimated, possible, or likely prices for Michigan football parking for 2008.&nbsp; It's based on the dataset I collected from the 2007 football season, which as you might recall had an unfortunate start (which definitely impacted prices). View Larger Map It needs better icons so you don't have to decode the color chart.&nbsp; Typically prices can vary $5 from week to week depending on the game, and if all goes well it will rain on a Thursday so that the golf course is closed and thus neighborhood parking is at a premium. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-19-michigan-footba/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Ann Arbor Link Bus starts service again next week.&nbsp; Every year I get tired of not being able to figure out when the bus is going to show up, and this year I tried to build a new map to help out.&nbsp; This is a work in progress. The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I'll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.&nbsp; So the Y stop becomes an 11 stop, since the bus is supposed to get there at 11 26 41 56. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-18-link-bus-2008-m/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As seen in the Duke University news: Little Teeth Suggest Big Jump in Primate Timeline DURHAM, NC -- Tiny fossilized teeth excavated from an Indian open-pit coal mine could be the oldest Asian remains ever found of anthropoids, the primate lineage of today's monkeys, apes and humans, say researchers from Duke University and the Indian Institute of Technology. Just 9-thousandths of a square inch in size, the teeth are about 54.5 million years old and suggest these early primates were no larger than modern dwarf lemurs weighing about 2 to 3 ounces. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-anthrasimias-gu/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I've told you once, I've told you 146 times: repetition is the very soul of the net. SuperMemo is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.&nbsp; His 1992 masters thesis, Optimization of Learning, covered the early work on Supermemo and a discussion of spaced repetition in learning. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-supermemo-repet/">&raquo;</a></p>
