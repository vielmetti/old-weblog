UPDATE: Penn State football coach Joe Paterno died January 22, 2012, of complications from lung cancer treatment. He was 85. Hours before, his death was prematurely announced by multiple news services, prompting retractions and apologies from those organizations.
CBSSports.com extends apology to Paterno family:

 Earlier Saturday night, CBSSports.com published an unsubstantiated report that former Penn State coach Joe Paterno had died. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-22-retraction-watch-joe-paterno/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable.
Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don't always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it's possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-09-personal-public-and-team-wikis/">&raquo;</a></p>

This view shows 4 of the 5 trucks that were out on Monday evening, January 2, 2012.
Plow routes are color coded, and plow trucks are numbered. One tip: if you are using Chrome, turn on and off the &quot;label&quot; field to get the trucks to show.

            <p>Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt - marvelous error! -
that I had a beehive
here inside my heart.
And the golden bees
were making white combs
and sweet honey
from all my old failures.

Last night I had a dream—
a blessed illusion it was—
I dreamt of a hive at work

            <p>BJ Fogg is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce three tiny habits that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-21-grand-resolutions-vs-tiny-habits/">&raquo;</a></p>

 I agree! There is a serious lack of sandwich reporting on this website. I, for one, love sandwiches. What if all the pet stories were sandwich stories instead?
