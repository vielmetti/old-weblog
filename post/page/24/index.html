The a2trees app provides some kind of on-the-go listing of street trees in Ann Arbor that are interesting.

        <p>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.GOV, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for "Obamacare" plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?

Reuters took a look at the issue, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace's systems design.
 Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-06-slow-obamacare-registration-denial-of-service-attack-or-self-inflicted-injury/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Tor Project runs Tor ("The Onion Router"), a network designed to provide its users with anonymity when using the Internet. Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.
Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-04-spy-vs-spy-tor-us-naval-intelligence-designed-anonymous-network-attacked-by-nsa/">&raquo;</a></p>

The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-27-writers-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've started using Meetup.com to organize several groups. Here's some notes.
For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the a2b3 group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the a2b3 meetup which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-24-notes-on-meetup/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back.
The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.
Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:
 AllRecipes adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing Epicurious replaces the mayo with heavy cream and adds some chopped parsley and mustard Boston Organics follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint The Floating Kitchen adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt Martha Stewart dresses the slaw with olive oil and lemon juice and skips the mayo Edible Twin Cities adds some fennel to the salad  I could continue but this is enough meta-information to head to the kitchen. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-21-kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw-a-study-in-comparative-literature/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here's my varied experience with these requests. I'm not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn't necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.
The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I've been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-19-retrieving-foia-logs-a-study-in-contrasts/">&raquo;</a></p>
