        <p>We had purple beans for dinner, from farmer&#39;s market.&#0160; I heated some olive oil in a pan and cooked them through until they had turned all green, and then salted them a little at the end. The recipe called for adding chopped almonds but it didn&#39;t happen; instead I served the boys tofu that I had cut into cubes and boiled (boiling it improves the texture quite a bit, firming it up more to my liking). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-08-04-purple-beans-for-dinner-or-anthocyanin-pigmentation-in-phaseolus-vulgaris/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>notes on the AnnArbor.com launch; first Sunday edition on the streets. We were at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market a week ago, and market manager Molly Notarianni had a sample left of an item that a vendor was gearing up to sell for next year: a tub with a praying mantis ootheca which, when left inside, would hatch little bitty mantids for your garden. Well, today was the day that they hatched - this video is someone else&rsquo;s kids enjoying their mantid hatch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-26-still-a-few-bugs-to-work-out/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some notes, before I quit for the night, from the launch of AnnArbor.com . We went live at 8pm Thursday.&#0160; I took a nap after coming home from work, got up at about 830pm, and went online looking at the comments; most of that evening was spent answering comments, dealing with details, being helpful and present and attentive.&#0160; As much as possible, I tried to be like Caterina and George were like at the launch of Flickr.&#0160; (I wish I had a better quote for this; here&#39;s the one I could find from Pinhead&#39;s Progress in 2006) They wanted to make Flickr so that users were facing each other, instead of facing the website. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-25-whoosh-site-launch-for-annarborcom/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Notes from day 16 of the new job at AnnArbor.com Here is the &quot;soft launch&quot; definition from Wikipedia; of course you don&#39;t completely trust Wikipedia, but it&#39;s a first start, especially when you credit it. Soft launching&#0160;is the method of launching a missile (such as an&#0160;anti-tank guided missile) in such a way that the&#0160;rocket motor&#0160;ignites outside of the launch tube; the missile is ejected non-explosively. The point is to minimize the risk of damage to the launcher by maintaining a safe distance. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-20-soft-launch-day-16/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been collecting data on parking prices for Michigan football games in yards near the stadium for a couple of years now; the better the team is doing, the better the chance that the $20 parking turns into $25 parking, or $15 turns into $20.&#0160; The one data point I have for Art Fair parking pricing for 2009 is that a lot near the new office is offering $15 parking, in a location that in previous years had fetched $20. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-18-parking-lot-indicators-art-fair-2009-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Another copy of the Ann Arbor Gerbil showed up on my sidewalk this morning. &#0160;It&#39;s nice to have a morning paper, much nicer than the mid-afternoon Ann Arbor Snooze that used to never arrive quite early enough to read over lunch, and by the time it got to be after dinner to read it it was most of a day old. Some of last week&#39;s Gerbils that were left on lawns unread decayed enough to leave crumbs of newspaper on the lawns of apartment buildings on Packard, no worse so far than the occasional decaying NY Times or Wall St Journals that sometimes pile up in front of student rentals unread. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-17-a-blogger-reads-the-newspaper-day-13/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every Thursday I organize lunch, come hell, high water, or Art Fair. &#0160;This time it was Art Fair. Eastern Accents takes a vacation in the summer time so I was on my own to organize something somewhere else; and all of Ann Arbor is full of Art Fair food vendors, serving a wide range of cuisine ranging from elephant ears and funnel cakes to key lime limeade and coffee. &#0160;(Water, $1 almost everywhere.) &#0160;There was even a Taste of Transylvania cart serving the traditional Romanian &quot;mici&quot; sausage. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-16-a2b3-nonsummary-for-thursday-july-16-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A quick post on my way from the Ann Arbor Farmers Market to work at AnnArbor.com. &#0160;It&#39;s art fair today, so there will be a zillion people on Liberty Street; the food coop is pretty quiet. The notable new item at farmer&#39;s market today was peaches. &#0160;Two vendors, Erie Orchards and Kapnick Orchards, both had peaches for sale - Kapnick had the Flaming Fury variety, and Erie had Garnet Beauty. &#0160; Here&#39;s what the net has to say about both of these: &quot;Flamin&#39; Fury&quot; is a line of patented fruit varieties (23 different sorts of peaches) which includes cultivars ranging from PF 1&#0160;which matures very early to PF Big George which matures very late. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-15-2009-ann-arbor-farmers-market-peaches-are-in-apricots-too/">&raquo;</a></p>
