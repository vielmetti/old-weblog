        <p>Each year is a new hurricane season, and each year the internet is a little different. Here&#39;s some things that are new that I&#39;ve noticed.
Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come. The word of the year is &quot;spaghetti model&quot;, illustrated below, showing a whole series of separate tracks from different atmospheric models to predict a set of possible futures for the storm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-23-hurricane-season-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For the most part, I don&#39;t comment on newspaper web sites any more; it&#39;s generally more effective to engage by writing the same message directly to the reporter or to the editor.
In some cases, good results can also be had by sending messages directly to the parties involved in the story, and cc&#39;ing (or bcc&#39;ing) the reporter in question.

        <p>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect.
The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this video from &quot;battlebauble&quot; on YouTube looks convincing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-23-when-the-boys-bring-home-trout-from-the-trout-farm-theres-no-question-that-its-trout-for-dinner/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &quot;I&#39;m eating a sandwich&quot;.) Here&#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.
From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &quot;Interpreting some of Twitter&#39;s API changes&quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-17-twitter-api-changes-cause-obvious-problems-for-developers/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>How many people do you need to know before it&#39;s likely that two have the same full name?
The answer is going to depend critically on the pool of people you are sampling from, and whether you count people in multiple generations as Sr., Jr. as &quot;same name&quot;. Similarly, middle initials or middle names will be distinguishing marks. What I&#39;m after is less about collisions within a family and more about two John Jones in your addressbook, otherwise completely unrelated. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-10-how-many-people-do-you-need-to-know-before-its-likely-that-two-have-the-same-name/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Thanks to Eli Neiburger for the heads up for this event -&#0160;
The Ann Arbor District Library is launching a new circulating collection of&#0160;electronic music tools, and they are brining &quot;Dr. Bob&#39;s Sound School&quot;, a&#0160;program of the Robert Moog Foundation, to AADL this Wednesday August 1, 2012.&#0160;It&#39;s an introduction to the principles of electronic sound synthesis,&#0160;a little history of Moog, and a chance to get your hands on some&#0160;seriously cool and unusual music tools. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-30-ann-arbor-district-library-to-circulate-electronic-music-tools-moog-foundation-event-august-1-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>According to Facebook, none of my friends have a birthday today. How many friends do I have to have so that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that there will be a birthday every day of the year?
An answer comes from the blog Math Goes Pop!, referencing the well known &quot;coupon collector&#39;s problem&quot;.
What’s known about this problem? Well, as I said above, even if you buy hundreds of thousands of cards, or stuff millions of people in a room, there’s no guarantee that you’ll collect every card or every date. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-25-happy-birthday-to-no-one-not-today-a-birthday-problem/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This is a corollary to Steve Fuller&#39;s observation
 Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.
 It&#39;s worse than that, of course - the system that has the goods is something you used to understand, but don&#39;t anymore, and thus you are ignorant about the very expertise that you once had.

A spill on this pipeline near Milwaukee led to it being shut down for a time this week, and even though the pipeline is back in operation, the effects linger in the form of a fuel shortage in the UP. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-24-july-2012-west-shore-pipeline-spill-leads-to-upper-peninsula-energy-emergency/">&raquo;</a></p>

The 2012 Michigan hay crop is not looking good, due to widespread drought conditions. From Michigan State Extension:
 The dry weather of 2012 has left most livestock producers in the Midwest scrambling for more hay. First cutting hay yields were down 20 – 40 percent in much of Michigan and with the dry weather intensifying, total hay yields for the year could be off by 50 percent or more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-24-2012-michigan-hay-crop/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for Kedgeree - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.
 2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee 1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt, pepper fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch hard boiled eggs for garnish  The method runs roughly as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-20-kedgeree-or-something-quite-similar-to-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&#39;s going on in real time. This is helped by the live simulcast of Ann Arbor City Council meetings on CTN, the city&#39;s cable access television feed, as well as online.
There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-17-tracking-the-ann-arbor-city-council-with-the-a2council-hash-tag-on-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.
The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-08-new-to-me-at-least-for-80s-music-on-the-radio-play-30-year-old-casey-kasem-top-40-countdown-shows-exactly-as-originally-b/">&raquo;</a></p>
