        <p>Imagine that it&#39;s the year 2020; it&#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?
Something new
One possibility is that people&#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-20-beating-facebook-imagining-what-comes-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The early reports from strawberry growers that send out periodic newsletters to their perennial customers is that Michigan strawberries will be early this year. If you normally plan to pick on Father&#39;s Day, you may be too late for the crop.
None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&#39;ll share those when I have them; it&#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-15-michigan-strawberries-are-early-in-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.
There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;smart grid&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-10-power-outage-mapping/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I used the Automark machine to vote today, as I did in 2010 (AnnArbor.com story) and in 2008 (Vacuum post).

This year&#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.
For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-09-i-voted-this-years-automark-trial-and-error/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Tonight&#39;s Ann Arbor City Council meeting discussed at great length the expenditure of some sizable sum of money for art that would be installed in the secured lobby of the Justice Center part of City Hall, where would you have to go through a security check to visit it.
What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-08-on-public-art-in-public-places-in-ann-arbors-city-hall/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-01-im-not-producing-content-im-writing/">&raquo;</a></p>

 In 2011, the number of workers belonging to a union in Michigan was 671,000, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported [on&#0160;Monday, April 9, 2012]. Regional Commissioner Charlene Peiffer noted that union members accounted for 17.5 percent of wage and salary workers in Michigan in 2011 compared to 16.5 percent a year earlier. At its peak in 1989, the first year state data were available, Michigan’s union membership rate was 26. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-04-30-union-membership-rates-by-state-2011-data-from-bureau-of-labor-statistics/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Michigan Daily story of April 15, 2012 has an excellent set of photos of MLK&#39;s visit to Ann Arbor on&#0160;November 5, 1962, and the story of how they were discovered.
 David Erdody, a digital curator at the Bentley Historical Library, discovered a series of 20 photo negatives in early January that feature King giving a speech and hosting a discussion at the University. These photographs, which have never been printed or published, depict King speaking and greeting a crowd at Hill Auditorium, attending a small discussion in the Michigan Union and having dinner at the University on Nov. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-04-29-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-at-the-university-of-michigan-1962/">&raquo;</a></p>

DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.
Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.
Busch&#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-03-18-a-visit-to-dexter-after-the-dexter-tornado/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government.
