        <p>Previously: OpenVPN in a container Also previously: Split tunnels considered harmful I have this running in a staging environment and a test environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing rather well.

        <p>Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich. That&rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies, even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative of what people are eating for lunch or a snack. Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need only point you at the Usenet Cookbook, developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year. It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing &ldquo;happy birthday&rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them. Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!) Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile. The topic of the conversation was roughly &ldquo;places to take a walk outside in the winter&rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include &ldquo;with a dog&rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get onto Arborwiki. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&rsquo;ve had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes. As it happens, there&rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-08-open-meetings-act-minutes-request/">&raquo;</a></p>

It&rsquo;s possible that you might have a tunnel configuration with multiple splits if e.g. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that I&rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them. The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&rsquo;re likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were trying to do in the first place. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-the-productity-oscillator/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container. I&rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &ldquo;stable&rdquo; branch. Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task, with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&rsquo;s docker-openvpn is what I&rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from jpetazzo/dockvpn which solves the same problem slightly differently. There&rsquo;s a tutorial on Digital Ocean that describes the setup including client-side support. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It seems that my pattern of going to public meetings includes writing FOIA requests during the meeting, to try to unearth some details of a matter observed at that meeting. Here&rsquo;s a brief update on some FOIA requests in progress. Washtenaw County Health Department. I&rsquo;m temporarily stymied in my quest to determine how often restaurants ask the county to change their inspection reports before they are published. An initial request came back with an estimate of $6000 to comb through every file in the department; an amended request looking for only 30 days of records only limited the cost to $1000. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-foia-update/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&rsquo;t have a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable response is &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;. There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&rsquo;s attainable for less than $6100. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/">&raquo;</a></p>
