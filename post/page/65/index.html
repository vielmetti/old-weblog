        <p>Matt Hampel has released a study of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Television Network.&#0160; He writes about an organization that was innovative and forward-looking in the 1970s that is now running with little public oversight and with only the most tentative ways of engaging with the public through networks other than cable television.
Most notable in the whole discussion is a comparison of CTN&#39;s video archiving and online access system with a similar setup at the Ann Arbor District Library. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-31-ann-arbors-community-television-network-a-study-by-matt-hampel/">&raquo;</a></p>

A toy cleanup vacuum attachment which can be used easily by attaching to household vacuum hose for the quick and efficient clean up of a plurality of different size and shape plastic building block toys. The toy cleanup vacuum attachment compromises: a curved suction channel for sucking up plastic toy building blocks; a convex plate guide with vent holes which guides the plastic building block toys within a suction channel into a drop channel while allowing the passage of vacuum current and dust; a rectangular drop channel through which plastic building block toys pass from the force of vacuum momentum and gravity; a transparent collection container for housing the plastic building block toys during cleanup and an air-tight bottom, hinged lid for conducting quick and simple dropping of plastic building block toys back into a toy box; a spring loaded push/twist thumb button agitator for dislodging clogged or stuck plastic building block toys; a grip handle for ease of use and. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-30-legolego-vacuum-patent-6048249-plastic-building-block-toy-cleanup-vacuum-attachment-/">&raquo;</a></p>

The best DTE site for updates seems to be mobile.dteenergy.com, as much as there is a "best".

        <p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;Twitter zero&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, Dunbar number and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-23-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &quot;free&quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&#39;s advertising there sponsoring it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-21-retrenching-on-web-20-controlling-your-presence-by-turning-off-abandoned-services/">&raquo;</a></p>

serendipity in book-finding: (via if:book)
the pinpoint accuracy of computer-searches, leaves those of us lucky enough to have spent time in library stacks, nostalgic for the unexpected discovery of something we didn&#39;t know we were looking for but which just happened, serendipitously, to be on a nearby shelf.

A new book on its way on the post-automotive era; quoting their release page in its entirety.
After the Car By: John Urry (Lancaster University) and Kingsley DENNIS.    Description It is difficult to imagine a world without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next few decades. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-15-after-the-car-john-urry-and-kingsley-dennis/">&raquo;</a></p>

 &quot;Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes&quot;
 Pocket ore docks are monumental structures used to transfer iron ore from railway cars traveling from nearby mines to ships that carry the ore to steelmaking centers or transfer points on the Lower Great Lakes. These structures were constructed from wood, steel, or reinforced concrete. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-14-pocket-docks-of-the-great-lakes-patrick-cooleybeck-paper-at-the-society-for-industrial-archaeology-d/">&raquo;</a></p>

 During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music community even this crumbling shard of Verde&#39;s never-performed Il Internetto. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-08-il-internetto-a-fragment-of-an-unfinished-work-by-giuseppe-verde/">&raquo;</a></p>
