        <p>Writing this up to support a bug report, please excuse the technical intrusion.
When I use the blockquote function in the Typepad editor, there&#39;s a sequence of steps that causes me to lose text out of the editor.
A series of screen captures follows. The general pattern runs like this:
 create three paragraphs select the second paragraph, and blockquote it; the third paragraph blockquotes as well switch to HTML view to confirm that the blockquote includes two paragraphs switch back to rich text reselect the second paragraph, and unblockquote it; nothing seems to happen switch to HTML view; the second and third paragraphs are not there reswitch to rich text, the second and third paragraphs disappear  I&#39;m using Chrome 21 on MacOS 10. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-07-typepad-editor-blockquote-bug/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I think I voted today.
I used the Automark machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&#39;ve used this machine before many times, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-06-i-think-i-voted-automark-machine-failure-for-2012-presidential-election/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name.
 Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.
 The Twitter hashtag is #snoreastercane and is in use already, with comments like this from @LoriG: &quot;Unexpected consequence of global warming: having to learn the names of a bunch of new types of storms&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-25-hurricane-sandy-is-being-called-a-snoreastercane/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &quot;regional outage&quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&#39;s the cause?
I did some searching and came across the very useful &quot;outages&quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-24-windstream-outage-takes-out-phone-service-to-customers-across-the-midwest/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Stashed everywhere in the 948-square-foot tear-down were maps. Tens of thousands of maps. Fold-out street maps were stuffed in file cabinets, crammed into cardboard boxes, lined up on closet shelves and jammed into old dairy crates.
 The find included all sorts of rare materials - here&#39;s only a partial list: <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-19-the-la-times-has-a-great-story-about-a-map-collection-that-is-going-to-the-los-angeles-public-library-after-the-collector-d/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>CBC&#39;s Radio 2 has 5 channels of online music going at any time, reflecting the need to provide programming from the Atlantic Time Zone to the Pacific Time Zone. Newfoundland, a half hour east of the Atlantic Time Zone, gets a shout out from time to time but not its own time slot.
It&#39;s nice to have a choice of five channels, because sometimes you want to have mid-day classical music, and some days you want to have afternoon popular music, and in this way you can just time-shift your listening all from the same page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-02-listening-to-five-channels-of-cbc-radio-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

Localwiki is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California.
