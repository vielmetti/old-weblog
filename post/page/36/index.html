        <p>The City of Ann Arbor&#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards. I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-15-how-many-signs-did-the-city-of-ann-arbor-remove-from-the-right-of-way-in-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ann Arbor&#39;s Stadium Bridges are reopening on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 after about a year of being closed for reconstruction, according to messages from the city. The latest information that I have is that the bridge will open at 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but that there will be intermittent lane closures for the rest of the week to finish up the job. City engineer Mike Nearing emailed me to say that &quot;at least one sidewalk will be open while our contractor works to clean and finish the work on the roadway and bridges.&quot; Photo credit: AnnArbor.com Our neighborhood had a block party to celebrate the end of construction last weekend, and AnnArbor.com was on it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-13-stadium-bridges-to-reopen/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective? One suggestion, from long-time blogger Prentiss Riddle, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-12-how-to-write-for-multiple-social-media-channels-at-once/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Writing this up to support a bug report, please excuse the technical intrusion. When I use the blockquote function in the Typepad editor, there&#39;s a sequence of steps that causes me to lose text out of the editor. A series of screen captures follows. The general pattern runs like this: create three paragraphs select the second paragraph, and blockquote it; the third paragraph blockquotes as well switch to HTML view to confirm that the blockquote includes two paragraphs switch back to rich text reselect the second paragraph, and unblockquote it; nothing seems to happen switch to HTML view; the second and third paragraphs are not there reswitch to rich text, the second and third paragraphs disappear I&#39;m using Chrome 21 on MacOS 10.5.8; the same problem happens on Safari on the same machine. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-07-typepad-editor-blockquote-bug/">&raquo;</a></p>
