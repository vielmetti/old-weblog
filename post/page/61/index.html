        <p>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&#39;re better than me.
The Westside Farmers Market, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&#0160; Ann Arbor&#39;s Westside Farmers&#39; Market is currently &quot;on hold&quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor.

        <p>The &quot;crisis informatics&quot; (Google search) term is new to me, but the research I&#39;ve been able to find under that term is familiar.&#0160; Faced with an unexpected crisis situation that is bigger than what the mainstream media and existing government organizations can easily manage the news flow from, how do communities response in emergency situations with social media and with ad hoc emergency response systems?
Without going into lots of detail I do want to share one recent paper that caught my eye, via Leysia Palen: Backchannels on the Front Lines: Emergent Uses of Social Media in the 2007 Southern California Wildfires. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-crisis-informatics-or-the-study-of-community-emergency-response/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On May 18, 1927, disgruntled school board member Andrew Kehoe bombed the Bath, Michigan school, killing 38 children and six adults.
There is a new book out on the disaster, entitled Bath Massacre: America's First School Bombing, from the University of Michigan Press, written by Arnie Bernstein.&nbsp; The press kindly sent me a copy.&nbsp; Bernstein has a historian's eye for small and significant period details of fascinating interest to anyone who thinks about what the 1920s were like in Michigan, which makes it easy to pick up anywhere and read some small detail that gives you a sense for the times. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-18-in-memory-of-the-victims-of-the-bath-massacre-may-18-1927/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow.
1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy.
2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-15-blog-more-twitter-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I put up a little project on github last night, twitter mutual friends.&#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.
I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &quot;follow or don&#39;t follow&quot; decision when someone follows you.&#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-12-twitter-mutual-friends-exploring-mutual-and-reciprocal-relationships/">&raquo;</a></p>

I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-07-i-am-not-an-information-activist-or-a-civic-minded-data-freak-thank-you-very-much/">&raquo;</a></p>
