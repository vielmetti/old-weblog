        <p>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council's amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.

        <p>Inbox zero just means that I have filled up the todo list. In this particular instance, my Gmail inbox is completely empty, and my todo list (kept in Github) has about 60 items on it, some of which have been on there for a year. At some point you get to the state where there's one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-01-inbox-zero-just-means-that-i-have-filled-up-the-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months, even though the Dread Pirate Roberts was taken offline. A recent graph shows the currency trading above $800. What has changed that would drive the price from $140 to $800? The only simple answer (right or wrong) is China. The South China Morning Post reports - A US Senate hearing put bitcoin firmly in the mainstream and triggered fresh support from countries that tend to fall in line with America's financial regulatory regime. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-24-bitcoin-at-new-record-highs-trading-in-china/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>"An Open Letter to President Coleman and Provost Pollack", published on um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/ - from the lead paragraph: We, the undersigned faculty of the University of Michigan, support your intent to realign administrative expenses relative to revenues. However we collectively reject the proposed Administrative Services Transformation (AST) project. We respectfully offer an alternative approach to AST, which we call Unit- Centric Services (UCS). We believe that the AST approach is inherently flawed because its focus is on reducing administrative costs without taking into account the concurrent reduction in faculty and staff productivity, collaborative academic culture, and the unique needs of heterogeneous academic units. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-23-500-university-of-michigan-faculty-protest-administrative-services-transformation-project-in-open-le/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I used to organize lunch every Thursday at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. Then the restaurant closed, and my A2B3 lunch group was set adrift. Here's what we've been up to. First and foremost, the email list that goes with the group has been steady even with the disruption in the lunch routine. There's a steady stream of questions with answers, job postings, news about events and the like. List membership is in the 450 range, and a relatively typical month has about 90 messages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-22-i-still-organize-lunch-every-thursday-a2b3-in-the-post-eastern-accents-era/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">&raquo;</a></p>
