        <p>Talking to Vula is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa.

        <p>Mack Collier has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (Here, go read it.) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does. Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!" These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-to-write-amazing-posts-every-time-and-why-you-shouldnt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-many-publishable-words-can-you-write-in-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council's amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change. More details Tuesday as stories come in from local media outlets. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-03-hieftje-veto-preserves-crosswalk-law/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Inbox zero just means that I have filled up the todo list. In this particular instance, my Gmail inbox is completely empty, and my todo list (kept in Github) has about 60 items on it, some of which have been on there for a year. At some point you get to the state where there's one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-01-inbox-zero-just-means-that-i-have-filled-up-the-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

(who did I miss) After everyone introduced themselves we did a few rounds of discussion of the projects that people were working on with public data as well as some talk about data that wasn't available in easy formats. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-26-the-3d-ann-arbor-civic-tech-meetup-a-writeup/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From the CHIRP web site - CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats. The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio's programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like Radio Reference and RepeaterBook to find the channels you want to have easy access to. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-24-programming-your-new-radio-with-chirp/">&raquo;</a></p>
