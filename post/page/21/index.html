            <p>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite".
The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-the-first-draft-of-this-essay-was-140-characters-or-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious).
The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-spicy-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-salad/">&raquo;</a></p>

UNOCHA South Sudan describes the displaced persons in South Sudan:
 On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-23-maps-of-south-sudan-and-its-capital-city-of-juba/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.
Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-23-blogging-is-easy/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.
For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-18-facebook-and-obituaries-part-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Blimpy Burger is running an Indiegogo campaign to help them reopen. Their location on Division Street in Ann Arbor was demolished to build student housing. Find out more at http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/krazy-jim-s-blimpyburger - as of this writing they have raised $1,245 of a $60,000 goal.
While you are thinking of that triple with blue cheese, brush up on your Blimpy ordering skills at Arborwiki's Blimpy Burger page.

Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like " <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-to-write-amazing-posts-every-time-and-why-you-shouldnt/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-many-publishable-words-can-you-write-in-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Information leaks are also a problem with email.
