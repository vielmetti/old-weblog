            <p>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.
The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.

            <p>this in from Crain&#39;s Detroit:
Grady Burnett, who led Google Inc.’s advertising operation in Ann Arbor, has taken a position with Palo Alto, Calif.-based social media giant Facebook.com as it launches a revenue growth push.
Burnett now runs Facebook’s global online and inside sales.
Ann Arbor is the headquarters of Mountain View, Calif.-based Google’s AdWords division, the pay-per-click, search term-based advertising that’s the company’s primary source of revenue.
I would think this would be worthy of mention on TechMeme but no other stories up yet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-04-grady-burnett-leaves-google-ann-arbor-to-head-up-facebook-global-sales/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>telegraphic codes and message practice Buell&#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-04-links-for-2009-06-04/">&raquo;</a></p>

 The race is July 11-12, 2009, with free on-site camping for racers and a bonfire the night before.

            <p>This seems to be a plausible strategy - people send you interesting things that you want to remember, so you post them to your blog so that when you search for them you find them.
If the blog seems overful of cut and paste of events sometimes, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m necessarily going to be going to all of them - who can do that with two kids at home! - but that it seemed like the best way to deal with an influx of details. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-on-emptying-your-inbox-into-your-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>We haven&#39;t scheduled our visit yet to Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, MI, but as a public service you should know that they are open.&#0160; From the mailing they sent out:
STRAWBERRY SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!! 
The first day of the 2009 strawberry season will be Wednesday June 3rd. As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&#0160; ready to pick. If you are looking to pick massive amounts to freeze or make jam it would be better to wait until they are more plentiful. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-michigan-upick-strawberry-season-opens-june-3-2009-in-rawsonville-mi/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09). That gave me a chance to enter &ldquo;airplane mode&rdquo;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-pretending-to-be-on-an-airplane/">&raquo;</a></p>
