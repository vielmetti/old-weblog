        <p>Follow the level of the Huron River as it goes through Ann Arbor&#0160;with the USGS National Water Information System. On March 23, the river is rising, but it&#39;s also fluctuating in levels, enough that it&#39;s difficult to determine whether current trends would lead you to believe that there is any risk of flooding. If you were to watch this closely, what would you watch? The USGS will give you an alert if the level of the river is above or below a certain level. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-03-23-huron-river-waterwatch/">&raquo;</a></p>
