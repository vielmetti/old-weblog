The tool of choice for going offline is a little Mac application called Freedom, which disables your Internet access for a specified period of time so that you can get things done.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>It is characteristic of an expert to have a systematic approach to problem solving. A very good example of this is George Polya's How To Solve It, subtitled "A new aspect of the mathematical method". In it he prepares the math student for a problem solving approach, not so much by the memorization of zillions of dry facts, but an approach and a set of heuristics (read "methods", "rules", or even "hacks") for dealing with a broad range of mathematical questions, discovery and invention. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-09-expert-heuristi/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>How do you become an expert in a field? By writing about that field, repeatedly, until you have mastered it to the level which people find you easily and draw on your expertise.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>You can be an expert with the blogger's secret: 1. Pick a topic. 2. Write about it twice a day. 3. At the end of six months, you will be an expert. Note well: choose carefully what you want to be an expert about! It's mighty hard to be an expert about more than one thing this way, just because it consumes so much time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-07-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Photo credit flickr user vegaluthier; licensed via creative commons. One of the regular top hits on my blog is the post I did about how to report a noise complaint in Ann Arbor. Recently, the local college has been doing a little bit of construction around their playing field, and some of the neighbors have complained about the sound. If you were going to spend too much money to monitor noise, you'd put together some kind of infrastructure with data loggers at various points around the area, all of which sent their readings (and perhaps audio capture) back to a central system for analysis and reporting and alerting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-07-how-to-monitor/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'll link to election results when they go online here. The Washtenaw County site has the official results. The Ann Arbor News has coverage on the blog, but, true to form, they don't link to the official results site in their coverage. Early returns (63% counted at 9:30pm) have both Ann Arbor millage proposals passing 3-1, and incumbent school board member Helen Gates-Bryant leading 2-1.
