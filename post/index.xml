      <title>Is blogging a bad idea?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every so often I wonder whether the weblog as a format has run its course, and
whether it might be a good idea to take some old materials offline.
It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to hit the publish button that some writings are of
lesser quality, and there generally isn&amp;rsquo;t someone else suggesting
the topic or vetting the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the chance that a random comment I made and published in 2000 or 2005 or 2010 is
still something that I want to represent with my name to the world in 2016?
Indeed, what&amp;rsquo;s the chance that in retrospect it would have been been better
to have had that observation quietly and privately for an unpublished
diary, rather than sharing an incomplete image with the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This editor&amp;rsquo;s conclusion is that much too much of the format gets
published without adequate editing, and that the collection as a whole
is improved by judicious removal of mediocrity after the fact. I&amp;rsquo;ve
unpublished about 50% of my 2016 output, and the page is somewhat
improved for the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github private repositories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Github has changed their pricing strategy to allow individual
accounts to have more private repositories. This is a welcome
change for accounts like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of their change, enterprise pricing has increased.
I&amp;rsquo;m told that this will multiply the bills that some companies
will see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post tests a new private repo, and links to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pricing&#34;&gt;Github pricing&lt;/a&gt; for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor quiet writing escapes</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-ann-arbor-writing-escapes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where to go in Ann Arbor to do some quiet writing, without distractions.
There are plenty of cafes where there are lots of people around; this
list looks for the empty places where you won&amp;rsquo;t have your attention broken
quite so easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a much easier task in the summer time than it is during the school
year, as the students thin out and University buildings are much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Campus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rackham.umich.edu/rackham-building/study-halls&#34;&gt;Rackham Building reading rooms&lt;/a&gt;, second floor. Very lovely, very quiet, recommended by many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/hatcher-graduate-library/carrels-hatcher-graduate-library&#34;&gt;Hatcher Graduate Library study carrels&lt;/a&gt;, especially on the higher floors. You&amp;rsquo;ll have a little room of your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law Library reading room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan League, upper floors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Museum of Art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palmer Commons, where the upper floors have writing desks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Work Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan Union first floor reading rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downtown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ann Arbor City Hall, council chambers (not during a meeting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweetwaters, Liberty or Washington St&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ann Arbor District Library, third floor (periodicals) or fourth floor (administration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Next Door, upstairs in one of the smaller rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mighty Good Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthaei Botanical Gardens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duderstadt Center library, second floor (periodicals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South side:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ann Arbor Municipal Airport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roos Roast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ypsilanti&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate in Depot Town&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, external distractions are only one part of the complex question of
&amp;ldquo;why are no words appearing on the page&amp;rdquo;. There are some a few tricks that I
use to minimize distractions coming from the computer itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write in a big &amp;lsquo;vim&amp;rsquo; window. Open up Terminal, maximize a window,
and then fire up &amp;lsquo;vim&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m managing to get 62 lines on the screen without
having to squint, and the browser is not on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go offline. If your writing environment allows, do your writing without
a connection to the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must stay online, mute notifications. On my Mac that&amp;rsquo;s a
&amp;ldquo;Do not disturb&amp;rdquo; setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a big screen up another functional way to avoid a distraction
is to keep sitting until the screen is full. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to
actually want to keep all of the words that you write - it&amp;rsquo;s OK to
discard some of them in a subsequent editing session - but the self
imposed constraint to fill the page all the way to the bottom on a 62
line screen produces a substantial quantity of work in a single sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful quality to cultivate is &amp;ldquo;sitzfleisch&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Germans have aptly called Sitzfleisch the ability to spend endless hours at a desk doing grueling work. Sitzfleisch is considered by mathematicians to be a better guage of success than any of the attractive definitions of talent with which psychologists regale us from time to time.  Gian-Carlo Rota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull up a seat, open up the screen, start typing. Don&amp;rsquo;t look up until the page is full.
Set yourself a time limit and a word count and aim for that. The time limit can
be enforced by parking in a space where your time is limited, which reminds
me that I must be going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A commonplace reader</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-a-commonplace-reader/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 01:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-a-commonplace-reader/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier and faster to fill a page by quoting from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonplace book is the annotated scrapbook, carefully collecting
bits from other writers with just enough commentary and selection to
make them your own. If these were written in this era you&amp;rsquo;d call it
&amp;ldquo;curation&amp;rdquo;, though I can only think of that word in the context of
&amp;ldquo;curated meats&amp;rdquo;, somewhat salty and dry and meant to be preserved for
some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the commonplace book. Why write your own words, when there are
so many other good ones already written to quote from? As it is said,
though &lt;a href=&#34;http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/&#34;&gt;no attribution is reliable&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immature artists copy, great artists steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artist steal from tonight is Brian Eno, in particular his &lt;a href=&#34;http://oblicard.com/&#34;&gt;Oblique Strategies&lt;/a&gt;,
which I now have as three lines of shell script plus 128 lines of text. A sample, intended
to be drawn at random:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not building a wall but making a brick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to brick-machines, this from Popular Science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bricks are fairly easy to make, but in the developing world, traditional fired bricks are sometimes weak and crumble-prone, while cement ones are often unaffordable. The Vermeer BP714 is the first compressed-earth-block machine that makes strong air-dried bricks out of dirt. Its bricks don&amp;rsquo;t just exceed U.S. cement-code strength requirementsâ€”they&amp;rsquo;re 20 to 30 percent stronger, and cheaper than other machines&amp;rsquo; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that&amp;rsquo;s the story you want to tell when someone else
has a lot of mud and you have a lot of machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonplace style of writing allows you to fill a page
with text faster, since you&amp;rsquo;re cutting and pasting it in
rather than sweating to find the exact words yourself. The
downside is that you might sometimes have to hunt for the
correct word, and it will be obvious that it&amp;rsquo;s someone
else&amp;rsquo;s correct word. There is no question of plagiarism,
just of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serious crimes in terms of writing are that of plagiarism and copyright violation. (Reality Studio)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long as we are going down this route, it&amp;rsquo;s worth rejecting
plagiarism as a thought-crime. From Kenneth Goldsmith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing: With an unprecedented amount of available text, our problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through this thicket of informationâ€”how I manage it, parse it, organize and distribute itâ€”is what distinguishes my writing from yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make patchworks. Most two word phrases can be easily found on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most two-word phrases are not produced under unpleasant stress, but in interest or excitement. (Penelope Leach, &amp;ldquo;Babyhood&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to provide the reader with enough information so that the article can be easily found on the References page. (Communication Research Methods in Postmodern Culture)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lists of real-world materials and their refractive indexes are easily found on the Internet.  (Lanier, &amp;ldquo;Maya Studio Projects Texturing and Writing&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retroactively we can construct some level of patchwork that we can crib from, in interest or excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bots are hot - again</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-18-bots-are-hot/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 May 2016 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-18-bots-are-hot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title of the post is taken from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/1996/04/netbots/&#34;&gt;1996 Wired article&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/koxinga21&#34;&gt;Andrew Leonard&lt;/a&gt;
describing the state of automated systems in the dot-com
era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web robots â€“ spiders, wanderers, and worms. Cancelbots, Lazarus, and Automoose. Chatterbots, softbots, userbots, taskbots, knowbots, and mailbots. MrBot and MrsBot. Warbots, clonebots, floodbots, annoybots, hackbots, and Vladbots. Gaybots, gossipbots, and gamebots. Skeleton bots, spybots, and sloth bots. Xbots and meta-bots. Eggdrop bots. Motorcycle bull dyke bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bots are hot today in part because natural langauge processing
has improved to the point where &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html&#34;&gt;Google can build hardware&lt;/a&gt;
to speed up their software algorithms and run their immense
training corpuses through it quickly to fine tune their approach.
The output of this effort is ASICs that speed up their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/&#34;&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/a&gt;
algorithm for machine learning. Thus Google can safely give away
their software, knowing that anyone else running it will use
a multiple of the energy that it takes Google to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s instructive to look at the changes throughout the years and
how bots have co-evolved with the networks and computer systems
that they inhabit. Early AIs like ELIZA and PARRY lived on
mainframes connected to very slow wide-area networks, and it
was years before the two of them talked to each other online.
The 1980s and 1990s brought Usenet and the automation that could
live on store-and-forward networks. AOL Instant Messenger&amp;rsquo;s
ubiquitous chat met popular culture and the emergence of
advertising bots like GooglyMinotaur, which promoted the music
of Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing what I think is some kind of manuscript about
bots and their personalities, a biographical dictionary of
emerging intelligences. I&amp;rsquo;m at about 10,000 words. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge
to try to corral that much quasi-intelligence onto the page, including
trying as best I can to characterize some systems that are
known only by people&amp;rsquo;s memories of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanical slaves and the Californian ideology</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-24-mechanical-slaves/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 23:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-24-mechanical-slaves/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noted elsewhere, saved here for reference, from&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/&#34;&gt;THE CALIFORNIAN IDEOLOGY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones
will have to be invented. The search for the holy grail of Artificial
Intelligence reveals this desire for the Golem a strong and loyal
slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are
made of sand. As in Asimovâ€™s Robot novels, the techno-utopians
imagine that it is possible to obtain slave like labour from inanimate
machines. Yet, although technology can store or amplify labour, it
can never remove the necessity for humans to invent, build and
maintain these machines in the first place. Slave labour cannot be
obtained without somebody being enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this and then think about Siri, Cortana, &amp;ldquo;Amy Ingram&amp;rdquo; and other
long-suffering inanimate machines that we imbue so much personality
into that some of us unknowingly
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-ingram-personal-assistant-2015-7&#34;&gt;flirt with a robot&lt;/a&gt; because we are so charmed by their devotion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-washtenaw-restaraunt-inspections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who: Wayne Eaker and the a2civictech Slack team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What: Restaurant inspections from Washtenaw County&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where: &lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&#34;&gt;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When: As they are updated, up to twice a momth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why: When you eat out, you care about food safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example searches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/?f[0]=field_count_total%3A%5B30%20TO%201000%5D&#34;&gt;Three restaurants with 30 or more violations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/?f[0]=field_inspection_violation_codes%3A6-501.111%3A%20Controlling%20Pests&amp;amp;f[1]=field_inspection_date%3A2016&#34;&gt;Reports from 2016 of pest problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of this project is that it&amp;rsquo;s dependent
on an undocumented interface from the contractor who
does the work for the county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very nice aspect of the system that Wayne put together is that
you can get alerts from every time a new inspection comes out that
matches your saved settings, so you can track a particular restaurant
or problem over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prince</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-prince/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist
passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response
any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music
responded by playing his hits - &amp;ldquo;Little Red Corvette&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raspberry Beret&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;Purple Rain&amp;rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control
also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find.
Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio that I remember is from the 80s when Prince&amp;rsquo;s music was
in regular play on the Electrifyin&amp;rsquo; Mojo&amp;rsquo;s show on Detroit&amp;rsquo;s WJLB.
Prince did a very rare live radio interview with Mojo, and you can
hear it in two parts - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJZCoxZ5COY&#34;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftKtWgXzMS8&#34;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; - on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I haven&amp;rsquo;t found yet is the computer font with a perfect Prince
symbol in it. You can get close by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://parkerhiggins.net/2013/01/writing-the-prince-symbol-in-unicode/&#34;&gt;writing the prince symbol in unicode&lt;/a&gt;,
or this ASCII representation may suffice: O(+&amp;gt; . But the
real deal came on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/following/2016/04/princes-legendary-floppy-disk-symbol-font.html&#34;&gt;3.5&amp;rdquo; floppy disc&lt;/a&gt; from Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earthquake in Ecuador, April 16, 2016</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-17-ecuador-terremoto/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2016 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-17-ecuador-terremoto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor, MI, 17 April 2016: An earthquake hit near the coast of
Ecuador on the evening of 16 April 2016. As of 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time the current estimate is 235 killed and 1,557 wounded from the
incident. Reports are still coming in from the hardest hit areas
which lost telecommunications lines in the disaster, so expect these
numbers to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports from Ecuador came in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abenavidesgol/status/721506479866572800&#34;&gt;primarily via social media&lt;/a&gt;, as it took
a while for the nation&amp;rsquo;s news organization to cut over to flash reporting
of the news from their regularly scheduled programs. The country&amp;rsquo;s
vice president, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JorgeGlas&#34;&gt;Jorge Glas&lt;/a&gt;, provided
regular and authoritative reports on damage and emergency response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the damage was almost entirely in Spanish,
as there is no substantial English language media presence in the
county. I found the automated translation service provided by Bing
in the Twitter feed to be indispensible. Some words that you will
see over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personas heridas = people injured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personas fallecidas = people killed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sin luz = without electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sismo, terremoto, temblor = earthquake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For music and (sometimes) news from Ecuador, I turned to Tunein, which
relays thousands of radio stations worldwide. At various times the following
channels were interesting or informative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Am%C3%A9rica-Estereo-%40Guayaquil%41-933-s68608/&#34;&gt;Radio America Estereo, Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Quito-760-s59649/&#34;&gt;Radio Quito, 760 AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Ecuador-Inmediato-Radio-s59648/&#34;&gt;Ecuador Inmediato Radio, Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for the shortwave broadcast of &lt;a href=&#34;http://radiohcjb.org/&#34;&gt;HCJB&lt;/a&gt; but
it would appear that its English language broadcasts are no more. There is
news in Spanish on the site under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://radiohcjb.org/author/noticias/&#34;&gt;Noticias&lt;/a&gt; banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some individual news feeds to follow from the time of the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/lewisshepherd&#34;&gt;Lewis Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;, Washington DC based analyst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/elcomerciocom&#34;&gt;El Comercio&lt;/a&gt;, Quito newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/_MayraPacheco&#34;&gt;Mayra Pacheco&lt;/a&gt;, reporter for El Comercio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ECU911Quito&#34;&gt;ECU 911 Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/IGEcuador&#34;&gt;IG Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, Instituto GeofÃ­sico with quake maps and scientific reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts go out to everyone affected by the quake.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrade to El Capitan</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-03-30-upgrade-to-el-capitan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working through the details of an upgrade from Mavericks to
El Capitan. Some running notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood
in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster
than my home UVerse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is &lt;code&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt;. You
would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed,
and that brew is working hard to update everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason that I upgraded was to get &lt;code&gt;xhyve&lt;/code&gt; and thus
Docker for Mac. I&amp;rsquo;m using the beta now (beta 5) and have gotten
a few trivial things to work, but am still sorting out a few
questions which might or might not be issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stadium Boulevard project bids high, portions of project to be delayed</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-stadium-boulevard-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 23:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-stadium-boulevard-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bids for the work came in higher than expected, so the
City of Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s Ann Arbor Stadium Boulevard road
reconstruction project will likely omit the section between Main Street and Seventh.
That&amp;rsquo;s the word from the city&amp;rsquo;s engineer on the project, Michael Nearing, P.E.
He writes in an email sent from his iPhone on Saturday, Feb 13, 2016 at 1:26 PM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it appears that the only realistic option to perform the project with the funds that are available is to revise the project limits.  We are currently reviewing the plans, the planned work, our material choices, proposed construction methods, and the bid prices received to determine the most prudent course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we better understand all the factors that will affect the work, we&amp;rsquo;ll share the information with Council and the public of our revised course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hopeful the we can re-bid the project later this year and start construction after the U of M Home Football season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the city&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/departments/engineering/Pages/Stadium-Blvd-Road-Reconstruction-Project.aspx&#34;&gt;Stadium Boulevard Road Reconstruction Project&lt;/a&gt; page do not yet reflect this new reality, and the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=448974&amp;amp;GUID=C566FAA5-1AED-4525-AA34-8F5A4E2FBF6D&amp;amp;Options=info&amp;amp;Search=&#34;&gt;agenda for the February 16, 2016 Ann Arbor City Council&lt;/a&gt;
meeting also does not include an agenda item on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chicken and onion curry</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-chicken-and-onion-curry/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-chicken-and-onion-curry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry&#34;&gt;chicken and onion curry&lt;/a&gt;
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431&#34;&gt;daikon raita&lt;/a&gt; from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor Public Schools respond to social media threat</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-25-ann-arbor-public-schools-social-media-threat/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 25 2016: The Ann Arbor Public Schools
issued this news release and letter to parents, signed by Superintendent
Jeanice Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, January 25, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear AAPS Parents,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you may have already heard, there have been threats made on social media to multiple school districts across the metro area, extending to Florida, and rumored to have occurred as far as California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be assured that in the Ann Arbor Public Schools, we take any and all threats very seriously and consistently follow established emergency procedures in cooperation with Ann Arbor Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received information in the early morning hours that Ann Arbor was included in this social media situation.  Police were notified immediately and we have been actively working with the AAPD since first learning of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our principals were advised early this morning of this situation, and we continue to work with law enforcement officials as part of our safety protocol. We will continue to monitor this situation very closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the use of social media for posting threats against schools seems to be increasing, I would like to ask all parents to talk to their children about using social media and instruct them that if they see anything on social media that is a concern, to immediately report it to an adult, such as a parent, principal or teacher.  If they re-post or pass on the threat, they can also be held responsible for issuing a threat and can receive disciplinary action as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be assured that we take every threat seriously as safety for our students and staff is our first priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeanice K. Swift, Ph.D.
Superintendent of Schools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###
&lt;/hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
