      <title>OpenVPN in a container</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task,
with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn&#34;&gt;docker-openvpn&lt;/a&gt;
is what I&amp;rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockvpn&#34;&gt;jpetazzo/dockvpn&lt;/a&gt; which
solves the same problem slightly differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-openvpn-in-a-docker-container-on-ubuntu-14-04&#34;&gt;tutorial on Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;
that describes the setup including client-side support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at the stage right now where I downloaded and installed
everything and created an &amp;ldquo;opvn&amp;rdquo; config file that successfully
loads into Tunnelblick, but where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite yet have
all of the routing set up. The slight complication in the
configuration is that I want to give access to Amazon
VPCs, so I have a few layers of software-defined networking
to knit together (or to unravel depending on your perspective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;network ho!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much much more, but this is a start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enjoy the attic while you can</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-19-enjoy-the-attic-while-you-can/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our attic is a three season room at best. In the depths
of winter it&amp;rsquo;s really cold, and in the summer time it can
be very hot. There&amp;rsquo;s a nod towards climate control but
it&amp;rsquo;s a long way from the furnace and the space is just
not really practical to equip as full fledged living space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a work table up there (where I am now) with some
tools, a few working shortwave radios, a couple of mostly
working computers, and a fair measure of junk. It&amp;rsquo;s been
the place where toys go when the boys have no interest in playing
with them again, which is to say that everything that&amp;rsquo;s
not Lego is up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the weather stays mild, I have ambition to put
the space to better use. At the bare minimum I&amp;rsquo;d like to
get to the point where every day I get upstairs to do
something, and where every time I come back down I have
something in my hands to put to better use somewhere else
or to throw away or recycle. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do marathon
sorting and cleaning sessions and it&amp;rsquo;s just not me, but
the every day approach at least gives you a chance for a
series of small wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, bit by bit, work at it. At some point it will get too
cold, and let yourself quit then. Try not to do everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write one paragraph, floss one tooth</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-19-write-one-paragraph/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The a2b3 lunch today was at Madras Masala, we had a crowd of 10.
I had a question about productivity - &amp;ldquo;what do you do every day&amp;rdquo; -
and the answers were a good mix of attempts to be diligent and
questions about whether narrowly focused productivity was even
a good goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small productivity approach that has stuck with me is BJ Fogg&amp;rsquo;s
&amp;ldquo;Tiny Habits&amp;rdquo; approach, which he writes about on &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyhabits.com/&#34;&gt;http://tinyhabits.com/&lt;/a&gt; .
The focus is not on New Years Resolution style &amp;ldquo;be a better person&amp;rdquo; goals,
but on very small and attainable accompishments which you can use
to build upon. &amp;ldquo;Floss one tooth&amp;rdquo; is the smallest example goal I can give,
with the understanding that if you can build up a solid habit to do
that every day then there&amp;rsquo;s lots more you can do for better dental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing equivalent of that is &amp;ldquo;write one paragraph&amp;rdquo;. I know that
trying to blog every single day is a task I&amp;rsquo;ve tried and failed before,
but I also know that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take forever to write a paragraph, and
you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have more than one idea to express to make that paragraph
worthwhile. Faced with an impossibly big deadline for an impossibly big
project, the thought goes, you might break down your resistance to working
on the effort by declaring victory at the paragraph level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week&amp;rsquo;s lunch (the day after Thanksgiving 2015) is at Morgan and York,
hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alpine, old school email</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-19-alpine-old-school-email/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 01:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-19-alpine-old-school-email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;alpine is an old school Unix mail user agent. It first arrived
on the scene as pine in 1992, and when it appeared I remember
how happy I was that there was finally a mailer that I could
hand to people who had never seen Unix before and that they
would get it and be productive on their 14.4 kb/sec dialup
modems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alpine appeared in 2007 as a rewrite of pine with Unicode
support and a new Apache license. The version of it I&amp;rsquo;m running
advertises itself as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alpine 2.20 (OSX 67 2015-01-07) built Fri Oct 2 21:36:59 EDT 2015 on Edwards-MacBook-Air.local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and seems to work just fine. I&amp;rsquo;ve got it pointed at the
old-school shared multiuser mail system that I&amp;rsquo;ve had
for a long time at monkey.org and all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rubenerd weblog has a nice
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/p3302/&#34;&gt;guide to installing alpine on OS X&lt;/a&gt;
using your favorite package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage of alpine over all web-based
mail systems is just how fast you can delete mail.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to select by pattern, sort, refile and
especially delete. In comparison, Google&amp;rsquo;s GMail
feels clumsy and slow and impossibly mouse-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I moved all my email over to alpine? No. There&amp;rsquo;s
a very small number of people who I prefer to send
mail to that way, and it&amp;rsquo;s always good to have a
fully functional backup email system that works
perfectly well on a low-bandwidth setup. My workflow
inside GMail is pretty fine tuned at this point and
very different from how I used to use pine, and I&amp;rsquo;m
not willing to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does remind me of the days before spam, and of the
days when you were actually happy to get messages!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer 2016 construction plans for M-14 near Ann Arbor</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-18-m-14-summer-2016-construction-plans/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 11:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-18-m-14-summer-2016-construction-plans/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MDOT plans to do major road construction work on M-14 in Ann Arbor
between Main Street and Miller Road during the spring and summer of 2016.
A construction start date has not been set yet as of November 2015.
In addition, bridge work will reduce M-14 to one lane between I-94
and Miller Road, and betwen Main Street and US-23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed set of plans is available &lt;a href=&#34;http://michigan.gov/mdot/0,4616,7-151-9621_11008_74324---,00.html&#34;&gt;on the MDOT web site&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://michigan.gov/documents/mdot/MDOT_M14AnnArborBrochure_504933_7.pdf&#34;&gt;in a helpful brochure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posted detour for M-14 will follow US-23 and I-94 around the freeway
loop around Ann Arbor. The following bridges will also have work done on
that that will close them for some amount of time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M-14 over the Huron River, the railroad tracks and Bandemer Park,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M-14 over Beechwood Drive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newport Road over M-14,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M-14 over Maple Road, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miller Road over M-14.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was talk of a part of Bandemer Park to be used as a staging area
for MDOT construction equipment. A review of the city&amp;rsquo;s Legistar system
did not unearth anything that would have been a necessary city review or
approval of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Chuck Warpehoski for the heads up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can I give up on LinkedIn yet?</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-18-can-i-give-up-on-linkedin-yet/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 10:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-18-can-i-give-up-on-linkedin-yet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about deleting my LinkedIn account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an early adopter of LinkedIn back when it first got started.
It was interesting, fun, cool to collect all your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my sense is that my LinkedIn profile is useless at best and
actively unhelpful at worst. Why would I want to publish a standardized
autobiography of work experience in a medium that doesn&amp;rsquo;t reward
complicated life histories? It&amp;rsquo;s not helpful - what&amp;rsquo;s more, it&amp;rsquo;s
not clear that it&amp;rsquo;s ever been helpful for the narrowly defined task
of getting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in hearing from you if you have deleted your LinkedIn
(or have stayed away from it).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Localwiki for Jackson, Michigan</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-17-a-localwiki-for-jackson-michigan/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 23:59:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-17-a-localwiki-for-jackson-michigan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is now a Localwiki instance up and running for Jackson, Michigan. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/jackson/&#34;&gt;https://localwiki.org/jackson/&lt;/a&gt; for the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any Localwiki just starting out, it is woefully incomplete. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome
to contribute to it, especially if you have some local knowledge of the area.
The site was seeded with a handful of articles that had been created from the
adjacent Arborwiki, and while it&amp;rsquo;s starting up we&amp;rsquo;re using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/&#34;&gt;Arborwiki Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; to help
push things along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to discover a new place is through the restaurants that have
some local notability but that aren&amp;rsquo;t at the usual highway exits. The first
discovery from the Jackson Localwiki is the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/jackson/West_Texas_BBQ&#34;&gt;West Texas BBQ&lt;/a&gt; on Brooklyn Rd
south of the city. &amp;ldquo;Authentic Texas pit style barbeque&amp;rdquo; is the attraction. Haven&amp;rsquo;t
been there myself, but now that I know it&amp;rsquo;s there it will be worth a detour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor&#39;s The Melting Pot is closing</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-melting-pot-closing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 15:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-melting-pot-closing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Melting Pot in downtown Ann Arbor is closing as of today, November 16, 2015,
according to a post on the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s web site and a story in MLive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last regular inspection of The Melting Pot by the Washtenaw County Health
Department was on May 26, 2015. It turned up 11 violations, and some of them
would be the sort of problems that would make you not want to go back.
A &lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/2015-05-26-melting-pot&#34;&gt;copy of the inspection report&lt;/a&gt; makes for tough reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observed the following: 1. Blackberries with mold like growth. 2. Mascapone: 2 - &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;. 12 &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;. - Past date. 3. 3 butter milks &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;. - Past date. 4. Prosciutto 10/13/2014.- Past date. 5. Two half &amp;amp; half &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;.- Past date. 6. Two whole milks &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;.- Past date. 7. Bush mills whiskey had fly&amp;rsquo;s floating around in bottle. 8. Dewars white label scotch had fly&amp;rsquo;s floating around in bottle. 9. Cutty Sark Whisky had fly&amp;rsquo;s floating around in bottle. FOOD shall be safe, unADULTERATED, and, as specified under # 3-601.12, honestly presented. (P) To correct discard all noted items into the garbage. Corrected: Person in charge discarded all noted items into the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant should be inspected every 6 months, which means that their
routine inspection should be in November 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve sent a query to the
county health deparment to determine if the restaurant was inspected yet
this month, and if so what the results were.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FOIA update for tonight&#39;s City Council meeting</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-foia-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2015 13:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-16-foia-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that my pattern of going to public meetings includes writing FOIA
requests during the meeting, to try to unearth some details of a matter observed
at that meeting. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief update on some FOIA requests in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washtenaw County Health Department. I&amp;rsquo;m temporarily stymied in my quest to
determine how often restaurants ask the county to change their inspection reports
before they are published. An initial request came back with an estimate of $6000
to comb through every file in the department; an amended request looking for only
30 days of records only limited the cost to $1000. The issue at hand is that the
county routinely delays publication of inspections by a month (or more), making it
likely that restaurants with really bad inspections can put the public at risk
for days before anyone is notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority. I asked for details on a FOIA fee appeal
that was on the agenda for the November 4, 2015 meeting. This came back on November 12.
Dave Askins requested a set of documents from the DDA and was presented with an
estimate for the cost of those records; he chose not to pay that amount, preferring
instead to appeal the decision on fees to the board. The draft minutes of the
November 4, 2015 meeting are not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City of Ann Arbor, Executive Committee of the City Planning Commission. I requested
meeting minutes and agendas for this board and the names of the members of this board.
My request of November 2, 2015 was responded to with a delay to November 24, 2015.
The Open Meetings Act requires that draft minutes be available within 8 days of
a meeting, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be appealing this delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City of Ann Arbor, Advisory Development Committee. This committee has meetings that
are open to the public regarding development matters, but the meetings themselves
are not advertised through the usual channels of publication for meetings. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked
for records of this group and was given a similar 15 business day delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIA is the world&amp;rsquo;s worst search engine - results come back very slowly, and they
are not always the same as the question you asked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I admire people who can tackle an ambitious task every single day. Heck,
I even admire them for doing some kind of nuisance task that still needs
to be done every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My every day challenge is to write. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get off that habit if you
make too much of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s way too easy to endlessly read the endless
Internet, mutter under your breath about how foolish it all is, and not
write down your bit of foolishness in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: write something, publish it, call it a success for today. The next
day, reset the counters all to zero, and do the same. You don&amp;rsquo;t hope to
have any dramatic results on day one, but maybe over time the results add up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When the FOIA request costs too much, ask for less</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that
it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of
the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate
files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have
a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable
response is &amp;ldquo;no thanks&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s attainable
for less than $6100. How frequently does a restaurant owner appeal or
protest the results of an inspection, and what sorts of things do they
complain about? To get some idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on I don&amp;rsquo;t need two years
of inspection disputes; 30 days would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how frequent these appeals are, whether there&amp;rsquo;s a form that
gets filled out of if it&amp;rsquo;s done by phone or email, and what the results
are. I do know that Washtenaw County routinely delays publication of routine
inspections by 30 days or more to allow time for appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the bother? Well, when a restaurant gets an awful inspection, it&amp;rsquo;s in
the public interest to publicize that promptly rather than wait weeks for
resolution. We saw this in Philadelphia, in this
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mobile.philly.com/beta?wss=/philly/health/special_reports/clean-plates&amp;amp;id=339602512&#34;&gt;philly.com story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city Health Department, which has had a long-standing policy of keeping restaurant inspection reports secret for 30 days, announced Monday that it will move to publicly post the reports &amp;ldquo;as quickly as possible.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-day delay meant that diners could unknowingly patronize restaurants cited for serious hygiene problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that 30 days worth of county records will be enough to discern
a pattern. Do restaurant owners routinely challenge the results of inspections?
Does the county modify their reports based on these challenges? Without
knowing anything about how the process goes, the inclination I have is to
want to have the same changes that were recently put in place in Philadelphia:
prompt publication of serious hygeine problems is a benefit to public health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Minutes and agendas</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-06-minutes-and-agendas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The City of Ann Arbor planned 49 public meetings last month; 5 of them
were cancelled. Of the remaining 44, 25 have meeting details posted to
the city&amp;rsquo;s Legistar calendar, and 19 have no record of the meeting
beyond its date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City boards and commissions and committees that routinely meet without publishing
minutes or agendas to Legistar include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Communications Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commission on Disability Issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Council Administration Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Council Rules Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downtown Development Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Dean Fund Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human Rights Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park Advisory Commission Dog Park Subcommittee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, the Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council and the Downtown Development
Authority post minutes to the DDA&amp;rsquo;s web site. The remainder have no obvious
record or trail of their activities, decision making, or agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The omission of minutes from two of these boards is particularly
distressing. The Human Rights Commission labors in obscurity, not
reporting out any of its meetings to the public, even as it is a
focal point for the response to the shooting of Aura Rosser last year.
And the Commission on Disability Issues doesn&amp;rsquo;t manage to produce
a record that is accessible by people whose preferred medium is written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the long, slow, drawn out ritual of asking the city
for minutes of meetings before. In 2010, I sent in a series of FOIA
requests that prompted the city&amp;rsquo;s Historic District Commission to produce
meeting minutes from that year, after being originally told that those
minutes did not exist. The city rectified that problem eventually, and
now those minutes routinely show up on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agendas of city meetings are key to understanding when you might
want to lift yourself up from your easy chair and get downtown to
weigh in on decision making at the city level. Minutes are important
as a record of what actually happened. Groups like the Human Rights
Commission, which is actively looking to advance its agenda, should
be working harder to make sure that the people can see what they are
up to. Otherwise you hold a meeting and spend time away from your
kids and there&amp;rsquo;s no record of it - why did you bother?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Github issues and open source projects</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-04-open-github-issues/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a first approximation, the number of open issues on an open source
project that uses Github to track its issues is a metric of software
complexity and project maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always worrisome to look at a project that has very few issues,
because that&amp;rsquo;s usually a signal that no one else is using the code.
Every bit of software has incomplete features that prompt a request,
and bugs looking for a fix. No open issues at all suggest a dead
project, or at least one that&amp;rsquo;s not actively attracting development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many issues, on the other hand, suggest a system that&amp;rsquo;s so
complex that no one person has a complete understanding of how
the project works. The number of issues can grow beyond the point
where a person could read and understand all the incoming bug
reports and feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every successful open source project deals with the struggle between
adding new features to fill out the original vision of the designers
and fixing enough bugs to make the system stable enough that it
can be used in production without undue fears. This tug-of-war between
features and bug fixes plays itself out over time, and sometimes
difficult and complex bugs that only affect a few users get
deprioritized over shiny new features that will attract a lot of
new people to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many open issues can one person track? I&amp;rsquo;ll estimate that the
number is about 100, plus or minus. So when a two person project
has 50 open issues, it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s under control. A project
that has over 1000 open issues (e.g. docker) can only raise some
warning flags - how did it get to be so big? What sorts of issues
can stick around for years and not get resolved? How on earth does
one profess to have any overall understanding of a system that
complex, short of devoting themselves to it?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open City Hall and government by survey</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-open-city-hall/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 21:15:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Open City Hall&amp;rdquo; is a survey instrument used to gather answers to
multiple choice questions. Municipal officials - it&amp;rsquo;s not clear who - put
together questions, and citizens are encouraged to tell the city what they
think by providing answers. It&amp;rsquo;s run by Peak Democracy, which provides this
same service to a number of municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current question under review is development on the Library Lot in downtown
Ann Arbor. The city has narrowed down the question to proposals from two
developers, and then posts questions like these gems to try to gauge public
sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CA Ventures&#39; proposal has an attractive, aesthetically-pleasing
design and/or conveys an iconic image suitable for a site that is
in the core of downtown.

Core Ventures&#39; proposal articulates a commitment to developing,
maintaining and managing an attractive public open-space.

Core Spaces&#39; proposed development will provide a return on the
City’s investment in the Library Lot parking garage and contribute
to the tax base in Ann Arbor.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far a grand total of 19 people have filled out this form, ticking
one of the boxes (ranging from &amp;ldquo;strongly disagree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;strongly agree&amp;rdquo;)
giving their opinion. There&amp;rsquo;s no spot in the survey form for any kind of
open-ended response about the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense for a citizen to spend the time filling out these
(poorly constructed) survey forms, or would it be better to spend
your civic engagement time elsewhere? Checking check-boxes is about
as weak a signal of engagement as I can imagine, and the low turnout
means that the survey itself is not likely to be listened to very closely.
You&amp;rsquo;d be better off writing a thoughtful letter and addressing it to
someone - anyone, really - to share your opinion. Or show up at a public
meeting (there are many of them) and say your 3 minutes when public
comment time is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking check-boxes on survey forms is a far cry from citizen engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
