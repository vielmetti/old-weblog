      <title>expertise encapsulated into out of date memory banks</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the case of experts &amp;ldquo;writing down what they know&amp;rdquo;, and
incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down
everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&amp;rsquo;s
no internal inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world usually works in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s changing fast enough
that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is
always holding as &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; in that memory bank something that is
demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under
them. Even if you have an iron-clad commitment to keeping the
memory bank narrowly scoped and revisiting every element of it to
refresh it periodically, the nature of written memory is to grow more and more
out of date or to consume more and more resources to keep fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map is not the territory - and even if by some miracle the map
at one time was perfectly matched with the world - the world changes
fast enough that we can&amp;rsquo;t know any more than a small part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the impossible task of keeping a Localwiki fresh in
the face of reflecting changes in a city, by Brian Eno&amp;rsquo;s quote
&amp;ldquo;Forgetting is as important as remembering&amp;rdquo;, and by
Jerry Michalski&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Brain&amp;rdquo; magnum opus. Of course I forget where I
read the Eno quote, and a search for it turns up William James saying
the same thing in 1892, but Eno is easier to remember as a source.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Michigan Emergency Incidents and overnight storm report</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-michigan-emergency-incidents/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michigan Emergency Incidents is a news service that covers emergency
dispatch around the state of Michigan. Members of a closed Facebook
group post call-outs of emergency services operations, and there&amp;rsquo;s
generally follow up from other members to note incidents in progress
or news stories written from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All information contained in MEI posts is to come from received
radio transmissions heard directly from radios / scanners or via
an online broadcast, verified reliable sources, or first hand
knowledge (ie you are on scene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow along on Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/meidispatch&#34;&gt;@MEIDispatch&lt;/a&gt;;
the twitter feed has the current link to the private Facebook group,
which regularly accepts qualified new members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm last night. We got a downpour, some wind and lightning, but nothing
too bad. A nearby &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.a2gov.org/RainGauges/&#34;&gt;City of Ann Arbor rain gauge&lt;/a&gt;
on S Industrial reported 1.12&amp;rdquo; of rain, and at the peak of the storm rain
was coming down at 0.41&amp;rdquo; in 15 minutes. The scanner was full of power
lines sparking and trees down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst hit was the Sleeping Bear Dunes area, where some of the
adjacent communities had complete power blackouts. There was also a
tornado in the Thumb. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weather.gov/apx/2015Aug2recap&#34;&gt;National Weather Service recap&lt;/a&gt; for the August 2, 2015 storms gives much more detail.
Softball sized hail was seen near West Branch, MI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current 8:45 a.m. report is 60,318 DTE Energy customers without power, and
91,802 Consumers Energy customers without power. DTE does not generally
report outages by county, just by zip code, but I have all of the zip
codes so I should be able to estimate county level totals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogrolls</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-02-blogroll/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2015 12:15:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-02-blogroll/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to,
in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&amp;rsquo;s one
way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely
gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have
obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages.
Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of
content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many
advertisements as we will stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, blogrolls are useful as a quaint reminder of times past,
and how we once organized our reading in the days before efficient
newsfeeds became the rule of the day.  Look at the bottom of the
far left of this blog for mine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knolling</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-01-knolling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2015 14:15:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-01-knolling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Knolling&lt;/span&gt; is the practice of organizing things neatly, especially to
arrange things in parallel lines or at right angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Jason Kottke&lt;/span&gt; for the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kottke.org/14/03/always-be-knolling&#34;&gt;always be knolling&lt;/a&gt; idea and
background info, which he attributes to
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Andrew Kromelow&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some inspriation see
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thingsorganizedneatly.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Things Organized Neatly&lt;/a&gt;, a Tumblr from
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Austin Radcliffe&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Hannah Sitzer&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.printmag.com/design-inspiration/always-be-knolling-my-new-favorite-word-inspired-by-tom-sachs/&#34;&gt;Always Be &amp;ldquo;Knolling&amp;rdquo;â€”My New Favorite Word, Inspired by Tom Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Tom Sachs movie, &amp;ldquo;Always be knolling&amp;rdquo;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://tenbullets.com/&#34;&gt;Ten Bullets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-CTkbHnpNQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously spotted in a similar way, the &amp;ldquo;5S&amp;rdquo; process of getting
rid of clutter, especially &amp;ldquo;seiton&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;neatness&amp;rdquo;. Everything goes
into its own place. Knolling is a bit more freeform and does away
with explicit labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does get me to thinking thought that I&amp;rsquo;m very tired of some of the
presentation of screens that I look at all the time. My Gmail inbox is
always a simple list; would it not be that hard some time to make it a
grid of squares with people&amp;rsquo;s photos in them, so that I could see at
a glance who was in my inbox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start to sort one thing, you want to sort everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-mitmproxy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 02:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-mitmproxy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href=&#34;http://cyber.jotwell.com/an-internet-x-ray-machine-for-the-masses/&#34;&gt;An internet x-ray machine for the masses&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/span&gt;,
a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to
get between your browser and the Internet and poke at
(and change) the traffic going between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mitmproxy.org&#34;&gt;http://mitmproxy.org&lt;/a&gt; is the home of mitmproxy. It&amp;rsquo;s
the work of &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Aldo Cortesi&lt;/span&gt; and a cast of
hundreds of contributors on github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy&lt;/a&gt; .
I used the OS X binary distribution from the download page.
There&amp;rsquo;s also a nifty Dockerized version on
Dockerhub as &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/&#34;&gt;docker pull mitmproxy/mitmproxy&lt;/a&gt;
to get you started quickly too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man-in-the-middle (or monkey-in-the-middle) systems are not
new, of course, and Dug Song&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/&#34;&gt;dsniff&lt;/a&gt;
package dates to 1999. What we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in a decade and a half
is that security through obscurity vanishes in the face of better
tools for looking at network traffic as it&amp;rsquo;s going by with high
level tools for making sense of what&amp;rsquo;s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, all of these tools have both benign and malicious uses.
If you can trick someone into using your proxy server for their
traffic, all kinds of foolishness can result. Better is the use
that you proxy your own traffic and behold all of the cookies,
beacons, and ads that sneak into your everyday browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Soundcloud, now and in the future</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-soundcloud/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 02:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-soundcloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have exactly one copy of something and it&amp;rsquo;s only on Soundcloud,
this would be an opportune time to make a backup. That&amp;rsquo;s always a good
idea anyway not to rely on single web servers for anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s
especially notable in the light of these articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the upbeat &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-10/can-soundcloud-be-the-facebook-of-music-&#34;&gt;Bloomberg Business&lt;/a&gt; article of July 10, 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; SoundCloudâ€™s potential is fascinating, and perhaps unique.
The founders have ambitious goals that respond to changes in the
way music and sound are created and consumed. Itâ€™s a beautiful
dream. So long as all the crucial participantsâ€”labels, publishers,
artists, SoundCloud itselfâ€”can agree on how to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the downbeat &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techtimes.com/articles/72325/20150729/soundcloud-losing-money-fast-as-record-labels-apply-licensing-pressure.htm&#34;&gt;Tech Times&lt;/a&gt; on July 29, 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently reported on rumors that popular music streaming service
SoundCloud is planning on adding a subscription-based tier to its
currently all-free streaming service, and that rumor was just
confirmed by company co-founder Eric Wahlforss in a conversation
with the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears that the impetus
behind the development of the subscription tier is clear: the company
is in dire need of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dire need of cash&amp;rdquo; because record labels are not thrilled with
the beautiful dream of listening to the world&amp;rsquo;s music for free.
Remember how Napster turned out? It was a beautiful dream, too,
but labels and publishers just saw it as piracy. This from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edmtunes.com/2015/06/editorial-believe-it-or-not-soundcloud-is-fighting-the-good-fight/&#34;&gt;EDM Tunes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 SoundCloud controversy is Napster all over again. We
arenâ€™t sharing files anymore, weâ€™re sharing sound. 15 years ago
record labels objected to us downloading their music, now they
object to us streaming it&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Napster, SoundCloud is a goldfish thatâ€™s been unwillingly
thrust into battle with three super-wale companies. Just for a
matter of reference, consider that SoundCloud has about 200 employees,
while the Sony, Universal, and Warner corporate networks employ
more than 200,000. At this point, SoundCloud is fighting to survive,
and unfortunately has received a lot of critical media attention.
Since its 2007 inception, SoundCloud has served as a haven for
electronic music producers and fans; allowing sound to be seamlessly
shared from artist to listener. This luxury is being threatened,
and weâ€™re all pissed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy Soundcloud while you can, and when you are producing things
for it make sure you keep a backup on your own machines!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Favorite times to twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late evenings (basically, now) when the West Coast early evening
crew comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early mornings, when Europe is awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Least favorite is mid-day Eastern time, when there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of noise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a2b3 lunch non-summary for 30 July 2015</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 12:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two
people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away.
I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about
quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch
a postcard from the command line of my Mac. It&amp;rsquo;s got to be easier (so I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to look up command line options) but the basic structure works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postcards are archaic, perhaps, and also perhaps more expensive per each than
reaching someone through Facebook advertising. I do have to say though that I
love sending them, and love receiving them in return. I&amp;rsquo;d love to do the experiment
of $20 spent on Facebook vs $20 spent on postcards, and wonder what the return
would be; or better yet, $20 spent on each and identify particular synergies between
super-high-tech and old-fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The card I got in the mail today was from Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain,
two of my faithful correspondents. They sent a photo of the Pickle Barrel House Museum
in Grand Marais, Michigan. The historic marker there reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pioneer Cooperage Company of Chicago designed this small
vacation cottage, which stood on the shores of nearby Sable Lake
from 1926 until about 1937. It was built for William Donahey, creator
of the Chicago Tribune cartoon story The Teenie Weenies. The house
was constructed as a typical barrel would have been, only on a much
larger scale. The main barrel contained a living area on the first
floor and a bedroom on the second. A pantry connected this barrel
to a smaller single-story one, which housed a kitchen. Donahey spent
ten summers at the cottage with his wife, Mary, herself a noted
author of children&amp;rsquo;s books. The structure was then moved to its
current site and used as a tourist information center. The Pickle
Barrel House is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a destination for next time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First round of postcards</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-first-round-of-postcards/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-first-round-of-postcards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A first round of postcards sent via Lob.com have arrived or are
nearly arrived at their destinations. The initial experience of
sending them made it clear that I need to do some simple user
interface improvements. I think I can cope with the current situation
on producing the card back photo, but again there&amp;rsquo;s more work to be
done making the text on the page wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reasonable question is, why do you send them? Why not send
email or a Facebook message? The answer is fairly simple, no one
ever remarks on my email prowess but even an ordinary card
elicits a response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blog every day, whether you want to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a topic, learn it well, and write about it as you learn it.
Or pick a topic you know really well already and teach to it.
Sometimes you can do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time spent blogging can&amp;rsquo;t be any less worthwhile than time
spent on Facebook or Twitter. The exchange is, instead of clicking
the like button and the favorite button, you actually have to think
a little bit and write something down that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

pulls in data from the site that hosts the official county inspections,
and is storing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zengenuity/food-inspections-data&#34;&gt;inspection data&lt;/a&gt;
on Github to make it easier for the next person who wants to build
a nice interface to all the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne was good enough to find a spot to host an interface to this data
that lets you browse through it; you can find it at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&#34;&gt;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are permalinks to each inspection so that you can link to them.
See e.g. recent inspections for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for three examples of places where I want to see a clean inspection on a followup
visit before I go or go back to there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tomatillo</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-tomatillo/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2015 17:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-tomatillo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a little box of
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;tomatillos&lt;/span&gt;
from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestions so far include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/raw-tomatillo-salsa/&#34;&gt;raw tomatillo salsa&lt;/a&gt; a la Rick Bayless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fried with onions and then add to scrambled eggs for tortillas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in pastel de Montezuma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I ended up making was a very simplified version of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/tomatillo_breakfast_tacos.html&#34;&gt;Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos&lt;/a&gt;,
reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs.
Cook chopped onions and chopped tomatillos over medium
heat (6 of 10) until the tomatillos are soft and the
onions are browned, about 12 minutes. Crack some eggs over the top of the
mixture and cover. Cook without stirring until the eggs are
set to your desired doneness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More discussion and commentary on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/edward.vielmetti/posts/10105504923525943&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Note that Twitter did not
supply a good stream of answers, but it did unearth
the one recipe I actually used, so there&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-make-tidy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad.
The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&amp;rsquo;ve
been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes
and what-not. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to review old words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at
times system called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zemanta.com&#34;&gt;Zemanta&lt;/a&gt;. Zemanta would
figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions
for related links, both to things that you had written as well as
to things other people had written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided as part of the transformation of the old weblog into
the new one to unlink those &amp;ldquo;related links&amp;rdquo;, in the hope that
eventually Hugo&amp;rsquo;s own system will create some either algorithmically
derived relations or at least an easier way to do that by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;m looking closely at what Zemanta did so I can
undo it. The first set of artifacts is a &amp;ldquo;fieldset&amp;rdquo; with its links,
and that&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to search and destroy. Occasionally but not
always I find my links decorated with a &lt;code&gt;class=&amp;quot;zem_slink&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; marker
that&amp;rsquo;s a little harder to find. Most insidious so far was exactly
one time where Zemanta (or Typepad) rewrote or wrote an Amazon link
to include an affiliate link points to Zemanta, and not to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewriting 1500+ pages is going to take a while. The biggest question
is unpublishing some of them, since time has passed and I don&amp;rsquo;t need
to republish everything. There&amp;rsquo;s conversion from HTML to Markdown
to remove the uglies, spelling errors to catch, next
categories and taxonomies to fill, layout to work on, etc. At
some point I need to sort out image management. But first I&amp;rsquo;m going
to understand the consequences of previous convenience decisions
I made to use Zemanta and to undo that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily coffee and wifi at Argus Farm Stop</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-24-daily-coffee-wifi-argus-farm-stop/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 09:55:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daily coffee and wifi at Argus Farm Stop, outside in the sunshine
under a lovely red umbrella canopy. Espresso over ice and a day-old
olive twist. The view is of a Sky Trak lift at the construction
site across moving materials to the back of The Mark, a building
that&amp;rsquo;s going up where the car wash used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news of the day is a death on State Street. A young man was
climbing over the skylights at the Nickels Arcade and fell to his
death when the skylight glass gave way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 1915, the SS Eastland was packed with employees from
the Western Electric Hawthorne Works when it rolled over in
the Chicago River. 844 passengers and crew lost their lives, making
the Eastland disaster the worst shipwreck on the Great Lakes.
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eastlanddisaster.org/&#34;&gt;Eastland Disaster Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;
for extensive notes on and photos of the scene and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/a2civictech/&#34;&gt;a2civictech&lt;/a&gt;
is coming up on Monday, July 27, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.literatibookstore.com/&#34;&gt;Literati Bookstore&lt;/a&gt; is open
again after a water leak caused them to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I wrote a tiny R script that generates maps. The challenge
today is to find a portable environment so that I can deploy this script
on shared infrastructure. The project took 30 minutes of MacBook Air processor
time running full blast parallel, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t care about wall clock time
to complete the effort I do care about building something that I can hand
off to someone else to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rocker-org/ropensci&#34;&gt;ropensci&lt;/a&gt; Docker
package from the Rocker project is the answer, or most of the answer, for this.
Rocker has built R images where lots of useful packages have been installed,
including systems where the install directions are a little bit complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all complicated software environments the biggest challenge is dealing
with dependencies. If you want to use the latest and greatest fast algorithms,
you have to be prepared to spin up on what the cool kids are doing in the
rest of their environment. If somehow you can jump to the edge of the development
in the algorithm world without being tripped up by the hairy dependency graph
that got you there, it can be a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So; install Docker on the Mac with &amp;lsquo;boot2docker&amp;rsquo;; then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;docker pull rocker/ropensci
docker run -it rocker/ropensci R
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and poof, you have an environment current to this month&amp;rsquo;s desktop of leading
R developers.&lt;/p&gt;
