      <title>OpenVPN scaling</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-16-openvpn-scaling/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-16-openvpn-scaling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/&#34;&gt;OpenVPN in a container&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/&#34;&gt;Split tunnels considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this running in a staging environment and a test
environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying
operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing
rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that
it runs on a single host &amp;amp; thus provides neither
high availability in the case of Amazon &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-20-aws-dynamodb-downtime-sunday-am/&#34;&gt;funkiness&lt;/a&gt;
nor scalability to handle lots of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting this to be more reliable was a matter of tracking
down the right systemd configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ll save systemd
commentary for a separate post, saying only that it&amp;rsquo;s new,
it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily better for managing single machines,
but I can see the advantages for consolidated management of
big collections of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some OpenVPN config alternatives to pursue that look like they might do
the right thing are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudcoreo.com&#34;&gt;CloudCoreo&lt;/a&gt; has a setup based on the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.
They say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an OpenVPN config up and running in AWS is difficult. We&amp;rsquo;ve already done it for you in an HA, durable, self-healing way. This blog post details how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog post is in two sections.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn/&#34;&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; details how they
configured autoscaling, elastic load balancing, name service, S3
storage and policies, and security and IAM policies to set things
up the way that you would want them within Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn-part-2-of-2/&#34;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt; goes on to describe the particular OpenVPN policy
and routing setup, and there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of policy there particularly
with the use of split tunnels that you want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their claim that they have
&amp;ldquo;done it all for you&amp;rdquo; reflects a &lt;a href=&#34;http://hub.cloudcoreo.com/stack/servers-vpn_c6a65&#34;&gt;complete configuration&lt;/a&gt; available
through their CloudCoreo system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach is detailed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.zalando.com&#34;&gt;Zalando&lt;/a&gt;, a Berlin based retail fashion platform.
Their article &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.zalando.com/blog/building-an-openvpn-cluster-zalando-style/&#34;&gt;Building an OpenVPN Cluster, Zalando-Style&lt;/a&gt;
uses dynamic routing to distribute routes, and the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/&#34;&gt;Quagga&lt;/a&gt; system as their software based router. This setup
does not particularly depend on AWS features, and they
claim that
&amp;ldquo;With this set up, we have about 800 users (150 in parallel) and havenâ€™t faced any performance issues at anytime, from anywhere!&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more complex to set up, though the writeup
makes it clear that because of the flexibility that dynamic
routing gives you there&amp;rsquo;s the opportunity to construct
firewall policies that follow the user quite independent
of how they are connecting to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. (John Gall, Systemantics)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I am eating a sandwich, with a recipe in Github</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich.
That&amp;rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies,
even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative
of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need
only point you at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/main.html&#34;&gt;Usenet Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;,
developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.
&amp;ldquo;I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I would have feared.&amp;rdquo; But that collection is
weak on sandwiches, lending itself more to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/us/SP-menu.html&#34;&gt;soups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this need I have started a small and pitiful but
hopefully growable sandwich recipe collection, using Github
as the hosting place of choice. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich&#34;&gt;the vielmetti/sandwich repository&lt;/a&gt;
for the first start. As it happens, I am clearly not the only person
to think this way; herewith some collection of sandwich collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrie Turner (@bazbt3) came up with roughly the same idea at the same
time, and you might see his &lt;a href=&#34;http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2015/12/10/git-sandwiches/&#34;&gt;git sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; blog for the proper inspiration for collection
development. Thanks to @ellemef for connecting us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single sandwiches in git include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magnus919/grilledcheese&#34;&gt;grilled cheese&lt;/a&gt;, from Magnus Hedemark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcon/recipes/tree/master/meals/fried_chicken_sandwich&#34;&gt;gluten free fried chicken sandwich&lt;/a&gt; from Patrick Connelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and certainly many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ill-equipped in your kitchen
to make your own sandwiches, this command line tool will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js&#34;&gt;order you a sandwich from Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with a makefile so that you invoke it as
&lt;code&gt;sudo make me a sandwich&lt;/code&gt; and it will do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes, 2015 edition</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2015 14:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings
is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing
&amp;ldquo;happy birthday&amp;rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and
paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile.
The topic of the conversation was roughly &amp;ldquo;places to take a walk
outside in the winter&amp;rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include
&amp;ldquo;with a dog&amp;rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get
onto Arborwiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always the Arborwiki &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals&#34;&gt;birthday deals&lt;/a&gt;
page came through, and I scored freebies or discounts at
Northside Grill (breakfast sandwich), Roos Roast (mocha),
Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Bakery (bread) and Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Coffee (coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical commentary of the year is that Twitter has an
opportunity to step up its birthday game, and it would seem
that that&amp;rsquo;s a chance to do things right (or do things differently
from Facebook, at least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the next time around the sun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Requesting meeting minutes under the Open Meetings Act</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-08-open-meetings-act-minutes-request/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-08-open-meetings-act-minutes-request/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes
through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor
routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve
had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the
Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recent request
that gave me same-day results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello, this is a request under the Michigan Open Meetings Act.

Please make available for inspection the draft minutes of the (named)
Committee meeting of today, December 8, 2015.

Under the terms of the Act, draft minutes are to be made available
for inspection within 8 business days of the date of the meeting,
or by my calendar December 18, 2015.

(Name) is listed as the staff contact for this board.

Thank you for your cooperation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request was routed to the staff member, and the minutes were prepared
and ready and shared with me the same day that the meeting was held.
Same day service!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kodi, formerly XMBC</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-07-kodi-formerly-xmbc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kodi.tv&#34;&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt; as a possible software
core for home media player for the living room. We have a whole
rack of CDs and a shelf of LPs from our music-buying days, and I
miss being able to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi is the software formerly known as XMBC, and XMBC is still
the name of the foundation that supports the work. It runs on
most systems, and there are several distributions of it specifically
for systems like the Raspberry Pi. in particular the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php/OpenELEC_FAQ&#34;&gt;OpenELEC&lt;/a&gt;
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a review or a how to, just some notes so that when
I come back to the task I will have a better running start at it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Split tunnels considered harmful</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 15:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://meyerweb.com/eric/comment/chech.html&#34;&gt;Considered harmful essays considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;, Eric Meyer, 2002; also Go To Statement Considered Harmful, CACM, 1968; also &lt;a href=&#34;http://harmful.cat-v.org/&#34;&gt;Encyclopedia of things considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;, from cat-v.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split tunnels are a VPN construction where instead of
sending all of your traffic for the network in a single
encrypted tunnel that collects everything, you instead
route some traffic down the encrypted link and other traffic
goes in the clear through your default connection. It&amp;rsquo;s
possible that you might have a tunnel configuration with
multiple splits if e.g. you needed to get to private
address space at two or more organizations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a choice, don&amp;rsquo;t use a split tunnel. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost are security considerations. The user of
the split tunnel introduces a possible forwarding path between
the outside Internet world (full of nefarious intent) and
the inside Internet world that you have a secure path to and
its chewy center. If an attacker knows that you are using a
split tunnel, they can put something on the public Internet
that causes you to send their traffic directly through to your private
network while you have all your trust relationships intact.
This could be bad, and if your security instincts trend towards
professional paranoia, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand that there&amp;rsquo;s a real risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second security consideration is unplanned leakage of private
information into the Internet. The split tunnel in its ordinary
configuration expects that you can distinguish protected traffic
from unprotected traffic by its IP address. The nature of
the modern Internet is that a browser can and will connect to
dozens or hundreds of hosts on its way to filling out a web page,
and any one of those connections might expose or leak some
information about what you were doing on the &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; link
that could be of use to an adversary or snoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, split tunnels are difficult to verify as correctly
configured. The managed endpoint of the tunnel can only see
traffic destined for it, and can only verify that what&amp;rsquo;s
there is going to the endpoint. With a split, the managed
endpoint doesn&amp;rsquo;t have visibility into all traffic destinations
and thus is completely unaware of any exfiltration attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there may be reasons that a split tunnel is unavoidable.
Here are some considerations to balance against the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A split tunnel is more versatile than a full tunnel. If your
users need to connect to more than one administrative domain
simultaenously, they may need to configure their local host
setup to have two or more split tunnels running at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the tunnel endpoint is at the long end of a slow connection,
or if the trusted managed endpoint is bandwidth or CPU constrained,
performance through a full tunnel may be unacceptably bad.
Splitting the tunnel means that only necessary traffic goes through
it, allowing better use of network resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s the cost. If the user is going to be a typical
Internet use and do simultaneous Spotify or Netflix or other
streaming media, it seems insane to pay VPN charges or engineer
your own VPN endpoint to handle that full stream of data when it
could very easily go over a lowest-cost unencrypted link.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The productivity oscillator</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-the-productity-oscillator/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 07:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-02-the-productity-oscillator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list
tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that
I&amp;rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues
is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have
things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&amp;rsquo;re
likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were
trying to do in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of the challenge is having some illusion of
control over what is going on. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work the queue
this way. Some times my goal will be to create more open issues,
putting things on the list to increase it up to a target goal.
Other times the goal will be to reduce the size of the list by
finishing tasks, clearing duplicates, or deciding not to get things
done. By framing it as a deliberate game of &amp;ldquo;add tasks up to a
target&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;clear tasks down to a target&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to trick
myself into taking on the easy things that I wrote down a month
ago that will take a minute to do but are off my immediate radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The productivity oscillator suggests both a pattern of work and
the illusion that whatever you are doing is the right thing to do.
If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck trying to get stubborn things accomplished, write
done some new easy goals and get those taken care of. It&amp;rsquo;s
a quantified form of &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/04/marginally_usef.html&#34;&gt;structured procrastination&lt;/a&gt; - which it turns out
I&amp;rsquo;ve been talknig about for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s anything still on my todo list from 2005!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Ed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Michael and I work at Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently it has come to our attention that there isnâ€™t a Nextdoor
for your neighborhood, and that you have registered in a nearby
Nextdoor neighborhood. Thank you for your interest in joining
Nextdoor and becoming part of your community on our website. However
we do need people to register at their real addresses, as it helps
us add a sense of accountability, security and transparency to the
website. Due to privacy concerns, I am forced to place a hold on
your account. However, this need not be a long hold! If you give
me your address, you and I can work on building a neighborhood for
you together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I am excited to
get you started on your new Nextdoor neighborhood soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your day,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Michael [Last name redacted for privacy]

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every month or so the Washtenaw County Health Department releases the previous month&amp;rsquo;s
health inspection reports. These are published to the county&amp;rsquo;s contracted web service,

&lt;p&gt;There are 272 inspections for October 2015 and 50 more for November 2015 available. Here

      <title>First snow of the 2015 season</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-21-first-snow-of-the-season/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-21-first-snow-of-the-season/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first snow of the 2015 season for Ann Arbor happened
today, November 21. The forecast is 6 to 10 inches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roads are slippery, and there are reports of a number
of crashes and cars in the ditch on area freeways. I&amp;rsquo;m
listening to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/3913/web/?rl=rr&#34;&gt;Washtenaw scanner&lt;/a&gt;
on Broadcastify and it&amp;rsquo;s a steady stream of road run-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers Market was busy but snowy. Holiday greenery
was well in evidence. We picked up smoked lake trout,
cabbage, garlic, rapini, and a cookie and a donut for
my market companions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite source of snow forecasting and snow reporting
is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/&#34;&gt;NOHRSC&lt;/a&gt;, the
National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center,
a slightly contrived acronym for the National Weather
Service&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive snow information service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of the snow season means that I dust off
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/heikkilunta&#34;&gt;Heikki Lunta twitter account&lt;/a&gt;,
@heikkilunta . Heikki is the Finnish-American god of snow,
and his Twitter account mostly retweets people who are
doing snow dances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November has been unusually mild and sunny, so this
snow brings us a little closer to normal. Time to check
to be sure that every has hats and gloves and suitably
durable boots and shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenVPN in a container</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task,
with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn&#34;&gt;docker-openvpn&lt;/a&gt;
is what I&amp;rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockvpn&#34;&gt;jpetazzo/dockvpn&lt;/a&gt; which
solves the same problem slightly differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-openvpn-in-a-docker-container-on-ubuntu-14-04&#34;&gt;tutorial on Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;
that describes the setup including client-side support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second &lt;a href=&#34;https://stefanscherer.github.io/run-your-own-dockerized-openvpn-server-at-scaleway/&#34;&gt;tutorial by Stefan Scherer&lt;/a&gt;
gives instructions for use in the Scaleway ARM-based server cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at the stage right now where I downloaded and installed
everything and created an &amp;ldquo;opvn&amp;rdquo; config file that successfully
loads into Tunnelblick, but where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite yet have
all of the routing set up. The slight complication in the
configuration is that I want to give access to Amazon
VPCs, so I have a few layers of software-defined networking
to knit together (or to unravel depending on your perspective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;network ho!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-stage-lighting-protocols/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes on stage lighting protocols and networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helpful reference pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dmx512-online.com/&#34;&gt;Ujjal&amp;rsquo;s DMX512 Website&lt;/a&gt; - protocol information,
tutorials, how to etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dmx512.com/&#34;&gt;DMX512.com, the Entertainment Technology Website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openlighting.org/&#34;&gt;Open Lighting Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards bodies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usitt.org/lighting/&#34;&gt;USITT Lighting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some protocols&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://art-net.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Art-Net&lt;/a&gt; is DMX512 over UDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openlighting.org/libartnet-main/&#34;&gt;libartnet&lt;/a&gt; is an implementation of Art-Net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much much more, but this is a start.&lt;/p&gt;
