      <description>&lt;p&gt;I admire people who can tackle an ambitious task every single day. Heck,
I even admire them for doing some kind of nuisance task that still needs
to be done every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My every day challenge is to write. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get off that habit if you
make too much of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s way too easy to endlessly read the endless
Internet, mutter under your breath about how foolish it all is, and not
write down your bit of foolishness in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So: write something, publish it, call it a success for today. The next
day, reset the counters all to zero, and do the same. You don&amp;rsquo;t hope to
have any dramatic results on day one, but maybe over time the results add up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When the FOIA request costs too much, ask for less</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-09-foia-ask-for-less/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that
it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of
the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate
files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have
a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable
response is &amp;ldquo;no thanks&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s attainable
for less than $6100. How frequently does a restaurant owner appeal or
protest the results of an inspection, and what sorts of things do they
complain about? To get some idea of what&amp;rsquo;s going on I don&amp;rsquo;t need two years
of inspection disputes; 30 days would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how frequent these appeals are, whether there&amp;rsquo;s a form that
gets filled out of if it&amp;rsquo;s done by phone or email, and what the results
are. I do know that Washtenaw County routinely delays publication of routine
inspections by 30 days or more to allow time for appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the bother? Well, when a restaurant gets an awful inspection, it&amp;rsquo;s in
the public interest to publicize that promptly rather than wait weeks for
resolution. We saw this in Philadelphia, in this
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mobile.philly.com/beta?wss=/philly/health/special_reports/clean-plates&amp;amp;id=339602512&#34;&gt;philly.com story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city Health Department, which has had a long-standing policy of keeping restaurant inspection reports secret for 30 days, announced Monday that it will move to publicly post the reports &amp;ldquo;as quickly as possible.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30-day delay meant that diners could unknowingly patronize restaurants cited for serious hygiene problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that 30 days worth of county records will be enough to discern
a pattern. Do restaurant owners routinely challenge the results of inspections?
Does the county modify their reports based on these challenges? Without
knowing anything about how the process goes, the inclination I have is to
want to have the same changes that were recently put in place in Philadelphia:
prompt publication of serious hygeine problems is a benefit to public health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Minutes and agendas</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-06-minutes-and-agendas/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 11:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-06-minutes-and-agendas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The City of Ann Arbor planned 49 public meetings last month; 5 of them
were cancelled. Of the remaining 44, 25 have meeting details posted to
the city&amp;rsquo;s Legistar calendar, and 19 have no record of the meeting
beyond its date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City boards and commissions and committees that routinely meet without publishing
minutes or agendas to Legistar include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cable Communications Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commission on Disability Issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Council Administration Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Council Rules Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downtown Development Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Dean Fund Committee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human Rights Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park Advisory Commission Dog Park Subcommittee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, the Downtown Area Citizens Advisory Council and the Downtown Development
Authority post minutes to the DDA&amp;rsquo;s web site. The remainder have no obvious
record or trail of their activities, decision making, or agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The omission of minutes from two of these boards is particularly
distressing. The Human Rights Commission labors in obscurity, not
reporting out any of its meetings to the public, even as it is a
focal point for the response to the shooting of Aura Rosser last year.
And the Commission on Disability Issues doesn&amp;rsquo;t manage to produce
a record that is accessible by people whose preferred medium is written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the long, slow, drawn out ritual of asking the city
for minutes of meetings before. In 2010, I sent in a series of FOIA
requests that prompted the city&amp;rsquo;s Historic District Commission to produce
meeting minutes from that year, after being originally told that those
minutes did not exist. The city rectified that problem eventually, and
now those minutes routinely show up on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agendas of city meetings are key to understanding when you might
want to lift yourself up from your easy chair and get downtown to
weigh in on decision making at the city level. Minutes are important
as a record of what actually happened. Groups like the Human Rights
Commission, which is actively looking to advance its agenda, should
be working harder to make sure that the people can see what they are
up to. Otherwise you hold a meeting and spend time away from your
kids and there&amp;rsquo;s no record of it - why did you bother?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Github issues and open source projects</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-04-open-github-issues/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-04-open-github-issues/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a first approximation, the number of open issues on an open source
project that uses Github to track its issues is a metric of software
complexity and project maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always worrisome to look at a project that has very few issues,
because that&amp;rsquo;s usually a signal that no one else is using the code.
Every bit of software has incomplete features that prompt a request,
and bugs looking for a fix. No open issues at all suggest a dead
project, or at least one that&amp;rsquo;s not actively attracting development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many issues, on the other hand, suggest a system that&amp;rsquo;s so
complex that no one person has a complete understanding of how
the project works. The number of issues can grow beyond the point
where a person could read and understand all the incoming bug
reports and feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every successful open source project deals with the struggle between
adding new features to fill out the original vision of the designers
and fixing enough bugs to make the system stable enough that it
can be used in production without undue fears. This tug-of-war between
features and bug fixes plays itself out over time, and sometimes
difficult and complex bugs that only affect a few users get
deprioritized over shiny new features that will attract a lot of
new people to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many open issues can one person track? I&amp;rsquo;ll estimate that the
number is about 100, plus or minus. So when a two person project
has 50 open issues, it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s under control. A project
that has over 1000 open issues (e.g. docker) can only raise some
warning flags - how did it get to be so big? What sorts of issues
can stick around for years and not get resolved? How on earth does
one profess to have any overall understanding of a system that
complex, short of devoting themselves to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open City Hall and government by survey</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-open-city-hall/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 21:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-open-city-hall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Open City Hall&amp;rdquo; is a survey instrument used to gather answers to
multiple choice questions. Municipal officials - it&amp;rsquo;s not clear who - put
together questions, and citizens are encouraged to tell the city what they
think by providing answers. It&amp;rsquo;s run by Peak Democracy, which provides this
same service to a number of municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current question under review is development on the Library Lot in downtown
Ann Arbor. The city has narrowed down the question to proposals from two
developers, and then posts questions like these gems to try to gauge public
sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CA Ventures&#39; proposal has an attractive, aesthetically-pleasing
design and/or conveys an iconic image suitable for a site that is
in the core of downtown.

Core Ventures&#39; proposal articulates a commitment to developing,
maintaining and managing an attractive public open-space.

Core Spaces&#39; proposed development will provide a return on the
City’s investment in the Library Lot parking garage and contribute
to the tax base in Ann Arbor.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far a grand total of 19 people have filled out this form, ticking
one of the boxes (ranging from &amp;ldquo;strongly disagree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;strongly agree&amp;rdquo;)
giving their opinion. There&amp;rsquo;s no spot in the survey form for any kind of
open-ended response about the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense for a citizen to spend the time filling out these
(poorly constructed) survey forms, or would it be better to spend
your civic engagement time elsewhere? Checking check-boxes is about
as weak a signal of engagement as I can imagine, and the low turnout
means that the survey itself is not likely to be listened to very closely.
You&amp;rsquo;d be better off writing a thoughtful letter and addressing it to
someone - anyone, really - to share your opinion. Or show up at a public
meeting (there are many of them) and say your 3 minutes when public
comment time is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking check-boxes on survey forms is a far cry from citizen engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Halloween Twitter vs Facebook</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-halloween-twitter-vs-facebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 16:30:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-halloween-twitter-vs-facebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The two online social networks that consume idle cycles for me are Twitter and
Facebook. They really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be all that different, but of course they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween Twitter for me was full of football, ranging from idle banter about
the score to full-on intense #goblue insanity as the game went down to its
final moments. (The Team won, 29-26, after The Other Team made a crucial mistake
at the end). You didn&amp;rsquo;t have to have a radio or television to know the score
and all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween Facebook was full of faces of cute kids and sharp-looking costumes
and accounts of how many trick-or-treaters showed up at the most popular spots.
(1,036 pieces of candy given out, one per kid, at the hotspot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter works best when there are a lot of people all synchronized on the same
event - it&amp;rsquo;s a remarkably good companion to television or broadcast radio in that
way. Unlike the dreams of &amp;ldquo;Interactive Television&amp;rdquo; of the 1990s, the broadcast
channel and the return channel are completely different, but the effect is the
same: the audience is connected to what it&amp;rsquo;s listening to and to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that same everyone-is-watching feel, but it makes up for
it by biasing the feed that you get towards pictures of faces of friends and family.
Even though there&amp;rsquo;s generally plenty of real-time content to go around, Facebook
makes sure you&amp;rsquo;re not lonely by encouraging you to post more pictures from years gone
by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to disconnect more from both networks - they absorb time without suitable
compensation - and write more elsewhere. We spend too much of our time looking
for favorites, thumbs up, and likes on both networks, calibrating the success of
our writing by how many random people in the random world clicked a certain button
in response. Still they both provide a measure of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Medium, pretty but disappointing</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-medium-pretty-but-disappointing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 15:50:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-medium-pretty-but-disappointing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Medium is a hosted blogging and discussion board at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medium.com&#34;&gt;http://www.medium.com&lt;/a&gt; .
It&amp;rsquo;s run by Evan Williams, who built Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is very pretty and functional, both for writers and for readers.
Authors get a lovely HTML based editor to write their text in, and readers
can do highlights and annotations. From a purely technical point of view it&amp;rsquo;s
one of the better systems for typing into on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, the promise of a pretty system does not extend the promise
that everything that&amp;rsquo;s written there will be smart and interesting.
One recent essay posted to the site complains that it&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;ldquo;hijacked
by life-hack gurus, designers and San Francisco people&amp;rdquo;. The page that
Medium provides as a home page for me bears this out - there&amp;rsquo;s an
extended discussion of &amp;ldquo;MCT Oil&amp;rdquo; (whatever that is, some diet fad),
advice about venture capital, &amp;ldquo;8 steps for &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;23 great places for &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;,
and &amp;ldquo;How You Train Your Brain To Get What You Really Want&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the pretty in the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help if you&amp;rsquo;re surrounded
by life-hack, growth-hack, *-hack content, which all smell like
thinly veiled self-promotion or advertising pitches. A steady diet
of this kind of writing is soul-killing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, disappointing. Shiny on the outside, nice fonts, good
use of whitespace, but uninspired content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slack vs IRC</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-slack-vs-irc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 15:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-01-slack-vs-irc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IRC is an old-school multi-system, multi-channel, multi-network chat infrastructure.
It dates from the 1980s, and was inspired in part by the BITNET RELAY systems that
effectively sent messages from mainframe to message over virtual punch cards.
RFC 1459 described the protocol in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is a shiny new system also providing multi-channel, multi-network chat.
It&amp;rsquo;s very much a product of the 2010s, emerging in 2013 after being used for
an internal communications channel at a games company. It&amp;rsquo;s currently valued
at a bazillion dollars in the frothy VC environment of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRC is open, reasonably well documented, and available to all through a plethora
of servers, clients, and web gateways. If you want to set up an IRC network
no one will get in your way, except perhaps your own ability to determine
which version of which server will work best with which version of which other
server. Once you build an IRC network out you have no one standing in your way
of doing whatever you want to do except your own technical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack, by contrast, is completely and thoroughly a 2010s private company. There
are private Slack networks that cost real money ($x/user/mo), and public Slack
networks which are free but only free because Slack-the-company has decided that
they want to provide some free usage tier to help kickstart their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest different between the two systems is ease of use. You can get up and
running with Slack by just providing a credit card, and all of the details are
taken care of for you complete with tech and developer support. For IRC you are
totally on your own, and the DIY denizens of that network are mostly friendly
but not always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most old-school of old-school Unix people I know still use
private IRC running on a local server, accessable only via SSH
with all members of the network personally vetted by the cadre
of sysadmins who run it. I like it that I have access to that
brain trust, but the more typical use of Slack for me this year
is the relatively large mostly public networks that have been
set up to support an event or keep a community together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been made of how incorrect it is for open source projects
to use a closed-source system for discussion. A few projects using
Slack have discovered that they are too big for the free services
that Slack is willing to provide, and they are looking for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the late-1980s public systems (eg. Usenet or Gopher)
IRC is still alive and mostly vigorous. But IRC will never be
pretty or cuddly or ironic in the way that a venture-funded Slack
seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor City Planning Commission Executive Committee meetings</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-31-ann-arbor-city-planning-commission/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 12:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-31-ann-arbor-city-planning-commission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission has an &amp;ldquo;executive committee&amp;rdquo;. The
names of committee members are not published on the city&amp;rsquo;s web site, nor
are they noted in an obvious place on the city&amp;rsquo;s Legistar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time, the Executive Committee holds a meeting to discuss
matters of public import. These meetings are public meetings, and the
announcements of their times and locations are duly noted on the public
posting boards inside City Hall. A small handful of people get copies
of the PDFs that get posted there so that we don&amp;rsquo;t miss a meeting (or, if
we do miss a meeting, we don&amp;rsquo;t miss knowing that it happened).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Executive Committee does post its meeting notices on the tack board,
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t list those meetings in the city Legistar calendar, and thus
the meetings don&amp;rsquo;t make it onto the web-based city calendar. Minutes from
those meetings are not routinely published to Legistar either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always disappointing to find a public body hosting meetings that
are inadequately publicized, poorly noticed, and where a record of the
proceedings is not readily available. I&amp;rsquo;m making inquiries into this
particular instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Eppie Potts for bringing this to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CubicSDR, a cross-platform software defined radio</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 17:10:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-cubicsdr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CubicSDR is a software defined radio system for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
It&amp;rsquo;s at version 0.1.4-beta as of August 28, 2015, and you can download
the binaries from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4&lt;/a&gt; or
the source code from Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point of comparison for software defined radio is GQRX. When you put
CubicSDR on the screen it has a very pretty waterfall display and relatively
easy to sort out mouse commands, but it&amp;rsquo;s lacking some of the fancier
controls that a more mature program like GQRX has accumulated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting direction that CubicSDR is heading in is the product
roadmap that is on its home page - in particular, importing and using
digital modes that the liquid-dsp package supports, and additional
visualization tools that would make a pretty display even prettier.
The roadmap easily has a couple of years of development work, so there&amp;rsquo;s
lots to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CubicSDR supports the RTL-SDR dongles like my NooElec NESDR Mini 2,
and it&amp;rsquo;s free-as-in-GPL, so it&amp;rsquo;s very much worthwhile to give it a
download and see what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The AAATA MicroAPI</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-30-the-aaata-microapi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a good conversation with Prabal Dutta today about the sort of infrastructure
you need to build a very simple bus tracker application for the current iteration
of the AAATA&amp;rsquo;s online system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desired goal is actually fairly simple: for a single place, identify the approximate
location of a bus on a single bus line that serves that place, and alert the rider in time
so that they can walk (or run) to catch the bus. Allow some time for getting there early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JSON endpoint that shows all the buses on Route 5 you can fetch as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -s http://microapi.theride.org/Location/5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the data itself has records that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {
    &amp;quot;Id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;48674187&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;routeAbbr&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;5&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;adherence&amp;quot;: -5,
    &amp;quot;timestamp&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;00:01:11.1189770&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;: 422301779,
    &amp;quot;longitude&amp;quot;: -837077535,
    &amp;quot;busNum&amp;quot;: 401,
    &amp;quot;routeDirection&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;to Ann Arbor&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;timePointName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Ellsworth &amp;amp; Braeburn&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;timePointAltName&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;N- Ellsworth Rd. west of Braeburn&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;crossingTime&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;4:46 PM&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;timePointStopID&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1327&amp;quot;
  },
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which reads as follows: &amp;ldquo;At 4:46 PM, bus 401 was 5 minutes late and located at
the Ellsworth &amp;amp; Braeburn timepoint. That was 1 minute 11.1 seconds ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s then a short exercise left to the reader to suss out what this means for them.
The simplest thing to do is to filter through the bus listings, pick out the ones
where &amp;ldquo;routeDirection&amp;rdquo; is heading the right way, and where the &amp;ldquo;timePointName&amp;rdquo; is
close enough that you can run for the bus but not so close that the bus has already
zoomed past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite general purpose tool for dealing with JSON data is &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt;, from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stedolan.github.io/jq/&#34;&gt;https://stedolan.github.io/jq/&lt;/a&gt; . It has a syntax for filtering through and querying
JSON objects with about as much expressive power as &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;. The slightly more
useful command runs like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -s http://microapi.theride.org/Location/5 | jq -c &#39;.[]|[.routeDirection, .timePointName]&#39; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which picks out &lt;code&gt;routeDirection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;timePointName&lt;/code&gt; and lands them on a single line &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;
suitable for any of your favorite Unix tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac
under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading
binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software
that&amp;rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully
noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means
that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the
stack until the software you had been using stops working. The easiest
solution is to pull the freshest of the fresh versions, with all
dependencies suitably upgraded as well, so that you can at least
get to par with the latest. Only then can you sort through debug
information and know that if you report a bug it can be repeated
by people who are running current code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Macports this is two commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warning of course is that the second of these two commands
can take a very, very long time, as new software is downloaded
and compiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is done! About 12 hours later, I again have a copy of
&lt;code&gt;gqrx&lt;/code&gt; that works, in particular the one that says that it is
&lt;code&gt;Gqrx software defined radio receiver 20151017&lt;/code&gt;. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have waited months to do the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of little boxes to type into on the Internet. Twitter and Facebook
will gladly accept your text and send it out into the world. Medium is there
if you want to be high minded, and Slack will let you narrow your message to
a choice few. And there&amp;rsquo;s always Github issues, any of thousands of projects
will accept a comment on an issue, real or imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden of diligence of blogging is to stick to a single system over a long
time, to drag around your past with you and keep it online, and to feed the
system frequently enough that it (and you) are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diligent blogger would not only have something to say every day but they&amp;rsquo;d
say it in the same place and connect it somehow with all other things they
had said on the same topic. Can you blame people at all for picking up other
new systems and trying them out? The blank canvas can be a lot more appealing
than the infinite scroll when you want to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Over the top networks</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-21-over-the-top-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-21-over-the-top-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk on Over The Top Networks at the Radical/Networks
conference in Brooklyn this weekend, October 24-25 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say in what order yet, but&amp;hellip;
the best way to predict that is to write down some notes. So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise, briefly stated, is that most successful networks run
&amp;ldquo;over the top&amp;rdquo; of existing working networks, and that you can learn
a lot from what goes wrong along the way when the underlying network
fights back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of examples, here&amp;rsquo;s just some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APRS is a worldwide location sharing system that runs over amateur packet
radio. It runs &amp;ldquo;over the top&amp;rdquo; of VHF radios, and sends out location
information for participating nodes to digital repeaters (&amp;ldquo;digipeaters&amp;rdquo;) that
relay the signal to others in the participating mesh. It&amp;rsquo;s designed
initially to be completely free of external infrastructure dependencies,
except for some good source of location information provided by GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This network worked fine at first, but as it got more popular, the network
got more congested. A single transmission from a moving vehicle would trigger
two or three rounds of repeaters resending the message, and in places
where the network was dense with stations there would be collisions on
the single radio channel. To compensate, some stations would set their
initial broadcast to repeat four or five times, increasing their own
chance of getting heard at the expense of more congestion network-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution ended up being fairly simple, once the Internet got to be
reliable enough. An internet gateway (&amp;ldquo;I-Gate&amp;rdquo;) was set up to capture
location information shared by radios, so that instead of transmitting this
data via collision-prone VHF radios, it went over the Internet. A much
small number of internet-enabled gateways were able to handle the load,
and it allowed stations that only had Internet connections to participate
in the network by sending their location reports directly to the I-Gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of radio lessons to be learned from the saga of APRS.
Stations sharing a single low-speed narrow band radio channel have to
work extra hard not to collide with each other, and the &amp;ldquo;hidden terminal&amp;rdquo;
problem (where a station interferes with another station that it can&amp;rsquo;t hear,
but that can hear it) ensures that network density leads to more problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usenet News started in 1979 in North Carolina, connecting computers in
the Research Triangle between Duke and the University of North Carolina.
It grew rapidly in the 1980s, taking advantage of whatever networks
were available to it. The relatively simple Unix-to-Unix Copy approach
to networking meant that virtually any data network that could be coaxed
into sending a data stream unmodified over a circuit could be put to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usenet ran over the top of dialup phone lines in its early times,
and this posed a problem: long distance calls cost money. Several
methods were used to great effect to get away from this financial
limitation on network growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very simple way to bypass telephone bills is to have the telephone
company call you. Researchers at Bell Labs, the home of Unix, had a great
interest in seeing the network succeed, and thus they routinely set up
their systems to make large numbers of outbound telephone calls to poll
remote stations for mail and news. The costs of toll long distance
telephone service were hidden inside the phone company&amp;rsquo;s own phone bills,
as well as the phone bills of several other large computer companies
where agile systems staff were able to avoid the attention of bean
counters (who would probably not have approved of spending corporate
dollars to retransmit rec.pets.cats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parallel approach was to reuse dialup networks originally designed
for terminals to connect to mainframe computers and repurpose them for
machine-to-machine use. In Michigan, the statewide MERIT computer network
was designed to connect research and education computing across the state.
Clever systems programmers (including yours truly) realized that it could
be also used to support slow but functional UUCP connections, and that
those links would not incur any per-hour or per-kilobyte charges. Thus
a bulletin board system in Michigan&amp;rsquo;s remote Upper Peninsula could get
free worldwide email and Usenet news feeds by befriending the right people
in Ann Arbor and adapting the particular arcane configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Usenet grew, the demand for bandwidth started to outstrip the
capacity of dialup telephone circuits. This led to efforts to use and
reuse the new source of &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; long-distance data services, namely the
evolving Internet of its day. By the time the National Science Foundation
had christened its super-fast, 1.5 megabit per second network, Usenet
News admins were ready with the NNTP protocol which could take best
advantage of the new network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s estimated that over the 10 year lifespan of the NSFnet that public
sources contributed over $2 billion to the network - $200 million direct
from the NSF, and the rest from a variety of state sources. By 1995,
Usenet News was consuming about 8% of the bandwidth provided by the network.
If that&amp;rsquo;s a plausible overall measure of the relative cost of that traffic,
that means that Usenet News could have had as much as a $160 million subsidy
over 10 years to grow and expand on the public dime. A good system to
build on top of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of building a successful network is that at
some point you look like a system that can be exploited for other
people&amp;rsquo;s use, just in the same way that your system exploited some
aspect of the surrounding environment to get its toehold into the
world. Two moments in the early 1990s development of Usenet show
signs of what would be its demise as a discussion forum dominiated
by researchers and graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until September 1993, the ebb and flow of Usenet as a discussion
medium was pretty predictable. A network dominated by graduate students,
Usenet typically got a lot of new users in September, who floundered
around until they either dropped off the net or sorted out how to use
it effectively. A year later another September would roll around, and
last year&amp;rsquo;s new users were now this year&amp;rsquo;s seasoned veterans, showing
the newbies around or harrassing them or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 1993 changed all of that because America Online, the biggest
online service at the time, decided to add Usenet access to its millions
of commercial customers. Not surprisingly, these new users were different
from the ones that came before them - they were more often that not
far removed from the academic and research and hobbyist networks that
had come before them on Usenet. A culture clash ensued, and in some
ways Usenet never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL&amp;rsquo;s embrace of Usenet is a classic &amp;ldquo;over the top&amp;rdquo; maneuver. AOL did
not have to hire any new moderation staff, run transcontinental networks, or
invent any new protocols to join in this existing network. Instead, they
could gather all of the benefits of providing their user base with access
to new services at a very small marginal cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of Usenet is also the theme of advertising networks
that took heed of Usenet&amp;rsquo;s worldwide low cost distribution system to
plant their own unsolicited commercial messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usenet had always been somewhat commercialized, ever since the first
person posted an ad for a dinette set for sale in New Jersey. Employment
advertising was tolerated or even welcomed, and regional &amp;ldquo;forsale&amp;rdquo;
groups prefigured Craigslist in many ways. But there was a social contract
that kept cooperating systems away from wholesale advertising. Sending
articles around the world costs money, and if the powers that be
knew that you were sending ads around on their dime they&amp;rsquo;d kick you
(or us) off the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1994, though, the social contract had weakened a bit. Commericial
internet service providers were selling dialup Usenet accounts, and
AOL was offering rec.pets.cats to the masses. How natural would it be
for someone to observe that they could get huge numbers of ad impressions
for little or no money to a receptive audience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the &amp;ldquo;Green Card Lawyers&amp;rdquo;, Canter and Siegel.
With the help of a programmer they designed an ad campaign that would
promote their immigrant legal aid to over 5500 separate newsgroups at
once. This burst of traffic - a separate ad for each and every Usenet
newsgroup they could find - was so substantial that they managed to
take some parts of the network offline (New Zealand, in particular,
which had some of the highest costs of importing Usenet anywhere, disconnected
temporarily rather than transmit the onslaught).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Usenet community response to the Green Card Lawyers and
their ilk was a sign that the community infrastructure of Usenet
was going to have to adapt to a world where some members of the network
were hostile and were going to try to subvert the cooperative enterprise
with advertising. Unsolicited ads all sorts of things followed -
sketchy pharmaceutical advertisements promoting male enhancement drugs
were perhaps the most typical. The Usenet architecture started to crumble,
as people looking to escape the noise fled to private email lists,
and as institutions supporting the net looked twice at their costs and
decided it might not be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep coming back to Usenet because it&amp;rsquo;s so fascinating, and I spent
so much time there, and surprisingly enough it&amp;rsquo;s still going. What can
over the top networks learn from its surprising longevity, even though
several generations of technologists have given up on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usenet is the prototypical mesh network. Individual nodes in the network
connect to each other, without needing any central authority to bless them.
They connect using whatever technology they agree to, without needing
to adhere to any central standard except for the format of news articles.
The network works with a &amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;rdquo; protocol that distributes texts to
all parts of the network that are connected that want to receive them,
and aspects of the flooding algorithm ensure efficiency and that no
one gets an article sent to them twice. For a 1979 design, it&amp;rsquo;s held up well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed irrevocably from the original is the content on the network.
Once upon a time, in the days before widespread use of the Internet, it
served as an amalgam of what emerged as all sorts of independent commercial
services. Modern day Github is an echo of the old comp.sources.* hierarchy,
delivering source code and patches and enhancements to your door. Quora
and Stack Overlow try to replicated the comp.* newsgroups, and
Reddit handles most of rec.*. Many if not most of the original newsgroups
are dead, overrun by spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What lives on is the alt.* newsgroups, in particular alt.binaries.*. These
were never welcomed by the old guard who remembered how expensive it
was to transmit anything over a modem, but now over 30 years later
the cost of the network is so low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern Usenet ends up being a vast expanse of digitized video,
and a host of specialized newsreaders designed to quickly scoop
down the movie or TV show that you want to watch. The distribution
and flooding algorithms are perfect for this task, and copyright
owners have to work extra hard because even taking down one copyrighted
work from one part of the network doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent you from pulling it
from some other area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to fast forward a bit from the 1990s to the modern day, to
illustrate that all sorts of contemporary networks have bootstrapped
their way to success on top of other, older infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first common pattern I&amp;rsquo;ll call &amp;ldquo;identity proxy&amp;rdquo;. The idea here is
that you can take advantage of an existing organization&amp;rsquo;s identification
process, without ever having to know someone&amp;rsquo;s login and password.
By extending privileges to anyone who can prove that they are a
member of some other organization, you can scoop up valuable early
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is one excellent example of this, especialy in its early days.
How do you restrict access to your brand new social network so that only
the social elites can participate? Simple, the onboarding process for
your new network runs over the top of the email system of the network
you want to attract from. Anyone who wants an account has to prove
that they can get an email from a harvard.edu address. Voila, you have
just run your login system over the top of a very expensive and valuable
college admissions process, at minimal cost to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack runs the same strategy when trying to recruit companies to use its
product. You can configure a Slack instance so that anyone who has an
email address in a particular domain is automatically approved. This gives
Slack leverage to gather employees for its &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; service and insight
to get those people into its paid service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Identity proxy&amp;rdquo; is a powerful pattern. If you find the right trove
of people who have a desirable email address, you can scoop them up
into your system and exclude others who don&amp;rsquo;t have the right qualifying
talisman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The state of the city, Ann Arbor, fall 2015</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-10-14-the-state-of-the-city/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 10:30:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A perspective on Ann Arbor area local government, as seen from fall 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top level view is that local units of government are struggling
with their technology investments, having a difficult time keeping
them working, and are unwilling or unable to commit to any sort of
&amp;ldquo;open data&amp;rdquo; initiatives as a result of their difficulties with basic
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples will illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City of Ann Arbor keeps track of a wide range of planning and
permit documents through a vendor system called eTrakit. This system
was down for more than a week in September, and still occasionally
crashes in response to a query. There is no general purpose &amp;ldquo;open data&amp;rdquo;
query to get access to the system, though the city does publish a
&amp;ldquo;permits under review&amp;rdquo; feed on its open data catalog that has a small
subset of the available data. Attachments in the system were recently
taken offline after unredacted credit card numbers were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City of Ann Arbor meeting agendas and minutes and documents are locked up
in a vendor-provided Legistar system, which is so difficult to use that
many boards and commissions don&amp;rsquo;t even bother to publish their minutes
through that system. Meeting agendas are often delayed in publication,
and there is no method available to search across the whole system for
documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor City Clerk keeps track of FOIA requests across the city
and publishes a &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; of requests. As is all too typical for
municipal government, this &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; is published as a PDF file, not
as plain text in some format that can be easily parsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City Liquor License Review Committee routinely evaluates applications
for new permits to serve or manufacture alcohol. These applications
are not published as part of the agenda for that committee or for
Ann Arbor City Council&amp;rsquo;s online system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go on, but the City Council meeting is tonight, and I&amp;rsquo;m
preparing something for public commentary (probably to add to the
discussion only after the decisions have been made).&lt;/p&gt;
