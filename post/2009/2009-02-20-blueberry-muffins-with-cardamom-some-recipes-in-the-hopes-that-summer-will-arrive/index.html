      <p>I&#39;m just going to keep posting about blueberries until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be summer again; I think we have a few tubs still in the freezer.</p><p>The search is for a blueberry muffin recipe with cardamom, and here&#39;s some sample of same, to see what the variety is in the recipes so that perhaps some meta-recipe will emerge.&#0160; Do be sure to read the first one through; it&#39;s a moving memorial and a story of how we celebrate the end of someone&#39;s life.</p><p>from <a href="http://cardamomaddict.blogspot.com/2006/10/ednas-favourite-blueberry-muffins.html">Confessions of a Cardamom Addict: 
     Edna&#39;s favourite blueberry muffins</a></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After the speeches and video clips we
spilled into the reception, its tables laidened with sandwiches and
sweets. Bowls of punch were off to the side as were carafes of coffee
and tea. But everywhere--and I do mean everywhere- were wicker baskets
filled with blueberry muffins. The Laurier catering team was given
Edna&#39;s favourite muffin recipe (she was known for feeding muffins to
visitors) and they made hundreds of them. The recipe was also given to
each of us, along with a copy of her favourite poem.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: arial;"><br />In her own words &quot;I&#39;ve eaten a lot of blueberry muffins in my day, but none as good as my sister Norma&#39;s.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Edna&#39;s Favourite Blueberry Muffins</strong><br /><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />50g soft butter (1/4 c)<br />125g sugar (3/4 c)<br />1 egg, well beaten<br />160g pastry flour (1-1/2c)<br />1/2 tsp salt<br />1 dspn baking powder (2 tsp)<br />150g blueberries (fresh or frozen) (1 c)<br /><br /><br /></span><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: arial;">Preheat oven to 375F/190C and line or butter 12 medium muffin cups/9 large muffin cups.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial;">Sift together flour, salt and baking powder.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial;">Cream together butter and sugar. Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with milk. Fold in blueberries.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: arial;">Fill the tins (at least 2/3 full). Bake for 15-20 minutes or until done.</span></li>
</ul>
</div><p><a href="http://foodaccordingtome.com/2008/unrivaled-blueberry-muffins/">food.&#0160; according to me.&#0160; [Unrivaled] Blueberry Muffins</a></p><p>(this one doesn&#39;t have cardamom in it, but I will quote the preface to the recipe; you can link to the actual recipe)</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://foodaccordingtome.com/picture_library/ATK_blues.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img alt="" class="alignleft " src="http://foodaccordingtome.com/picture_library/ATK_blues.jpg" title="ATK Best Blueberry Muffins." width="200" /></a>After posting <a href="http://foodaccordingtome.com/2008/champion-blueberry-muffins/#post-428">Champion Blueberry Muffins</a>,
more people have come to this site looking for from-scratch blueberry
muffins than, as far as I can tell by the search terms that lead people
here, anything else. I&#39;ve been feeling sort of guilty: that post was
such a tease. Unfortunately, blueberries are definitely out of season
during these dark days; but maybe you stashed some in your refrigerator
last August...</p><p><a href="http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=337987">a recipe from amyburns1999 on SparkPeople for Blueberry Cardamom Muffins</a>; it&#39;s vegan, should that be relevant to you.&#0160; (personally, skip the splenda, but that&#39;s me)</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">These are so delicious you should make a double batch so you can freeze
some for later or share with friends. I normally substitute the sugar
with splenda for less calories.<br /><span class="gray12"><em>45 Minutes to Prepare and Cook</em></span><br /><br /><br /></div>
        
        
    

     
     <h2 style="margin-left: 40px;">Ingredients</h2>
     
     <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div>
     
     
<div id="ingredients" style="margin-left: 40px;"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
1 cup almonds<br />2 cups frozend blueberries<br />2 cups flour<br />1 cup sugar/splenda<br />2 tsp cardamom<br />2 tsp baking powder<br />1/2 tsp salt<br />1 cup vanilla soy milk lite<br />1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

 <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><p>surprisingly - there were not a lot of these recipes that were easy to find on the first go-around; that might have been just because the general rule is &quot;optional: add some other spice to taste&quot;.&#0160; will report back after I experiment.</p>
