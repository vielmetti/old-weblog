      <p>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&#39;re concerned too.</p><p>The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.&#0160; Here&#39;s something like a narrative.</p><p>In the 1969, Jimmy Dean opened a sausage factory in Plainview, TX.&#0160; It closed in 1974, sat idle for 30 years, and then was reopened as a peanut processing plant in 2004.&#0160;&#0160; The best local source for news coverage is the <a href="http://www.myplainview.com/">Plainview Daily Herald</a>, and these clippings are from their online site.</p><p>From the Plainview Daily Herald, 4/15/2004:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jim Booher, who has been involved in food processing for 20 years, is working on opening his third plant and is highly complimentary of the cooperation he´s received here as manager of the Peanut Corporation of America plant. <br /><br />Renovation work is under way on the old Jimmy Dean Meat Co. plant on <br />the west service road of North I-27, adjacent to United Parcel Service. <br />The community landed PCA in December, offering an incentive package <br />which included $390,000 over 10 years with the Plainview-Hale County <br />Industrial Foundation, the City of Plainview and Hale County each <br />putting up $13,000 a year. In-kind work by each entity will be done as <br />well. The package does not include tax abatement. <br /><br />High Plains Millwright of Plainview is handling the demolition work, <br />tearing down some walls, taking out concrete tiers and doing other <br />work before renovation begins. A metal building will be erected on an <br />existing concrete slab and will be connected to the main building. <br />“We hope to be open sometime in August or September, depending on <br />when we get our equipment installed,” said Booher, who is moving here <br />from Grand Prairie.<br /></div><p><br />KCBD, Ch. 11, has a similar story from 4/21/04:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Plainview Peanut Plant to Open this Summer <br />Peanut production in West Texas is growing and <br />that&#39;s why local farmers are excited about the <br />new plant. The plant is undergoing a facelift to <br />make way for 80,000 square feet of peanut <br />processing machinery. &quot;We&#39;re looking at <br />probably within the next three months of <br />putting equipment in and painting and getting <br />ready for operation,&quot; says plant manager, Jim <br />Booher. <br /></div><p><br />The cached copy of the PCA site (since removed) has this to say about the Texas plant:</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">We&#39;re Ready NOW, not later! <br />Beginning with the first load of <br />peanuts ever processed at Peanut <br />Corporation&#39;s new Texas plant, our <br />most&#0160; important&#0160; task has been <br />quality.&#0160; We don&#39;t&#0160; request&#0160; your <br />patience while we figure out how to <br />do this. <br />Instead, we request that you hold us <br />to the high standards you&#39;ve always <br />expected from a Peanut Corporation <br />of America plant. We&#39;re ready.&#0160; <br />Pride in Our Newest Plant. Pride in Texas! <br />There couldn&#39;t be a more perfect location than Plainview, <br />Texas for the newest addition to Peanut Corporation&#39;s list of <br />plants! Just off North Interstate 27 in Plainview, we connect <br />the Western and Central&#0160; United States with the Texas <br />Peanut Industry. Texas really is the best state, y&#39;all! <br />&#0160;<br />Blanchers <br />Product Listing <br />Coming soon to this spot: a comprehensive <br />listing of products and services brought to <br />you by Peanut Corporation of America in <br />Plainview, Texas. <br />Until the list is posted, please feel free to <br />contact Jim Booher, our Texas plant&#39;s <br />operations manager for a complete discussion <br />of how we can serve you. <br /></div><p><br />How did Plainview get the plant?&#0160; More from the Daily Herald, Feb 25 2007:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">One day,&#0160;Peanut Corporation of America President Stewart Parnell
from Lynchburg, Va., flew&#0160;in for fuel and a visit and happened to
mention that&#0160;he was looking to locate a peanut processing plant in this
area, and Miller directed him to Hale County State Bank President Brian
Pohlmeier, who&#0160;was on the board of the Plainview-Hale County&#0160;Industrial
Board.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">“As it turned out,” said Miller, “Brian had
been&#0160;Parnell’s&#0160;loan officer&#0160;for several of the planes he had bought and
it wound up with the peanut plant locating in the old Jimmy Dean plant.”</p><p>The Sept 1, 2008 Daily Herald has a brief story about the rehab of the plant:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The IDC has issued millions of dollars in revenue bonds to help
businesses in the area, including three bonds in Hale County and four
in Castro County — mainly for dairies, IDC legal representative Malcolm
Tisdel said.</span></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span>The city and county work hand-in-hand with the IDC and Plainview/Hale County Industrial Foundation to bring in new industry.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Jesus
Garrocho, operations manager at Peanut Corporation of America, said the
IDC was instrumental in bringing the company to Plainview.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>“The
(Peanut Corp.) facility had been empty for 30 years,” Brian Pohlmeier,
president of the IDC, said. “Now it has a business that employees
30-some people.”</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Together, the Industrial Foundation and IDC
have contributed substantial economic impact to the area. The IDC helps
not only Hale County but surrounding counties as well.</span></div><p><br />There&#39;s more from the 10/29/2003 Daily Herald:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The inducement package being offered Peanut Corp. calls for the
city, county and Plainview-Hale County Industrial Foundation to
contribute $100,000 each in $10,000 increments over a 10-year span. It
also calls for paving the parking lot of the plant and installing a
special water line for firefighting purposes.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The county approved the proposal Monday and the industrial foundation board was expected to do so today.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">
In return for the incentives, the plant ­ which will process shelled
and cleaned peanuts into candy and food products ­ is expected to hire
an initial batch of 35 employees, process 256,000 pounds of nuts daily
and ultimately invest $1 million in the project.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> “If they pull
out, we don´t pay the ($10,000) installments,” industrial foundation
Executive Director Grady Elder said in outlining the proposal at
Monday´s Commissioners Court meeting.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The plant closed in 1974. The building is owned by Ronald Thompson of Lubbock. </p><p>I don&#39;t know what a sausage factory that has been idle for 30 years looks like, and how much it takes to rehab it to the point where it&#39;s ready to clean peanuts for use in candy.</p>
