      <pre>Ann Arbor Transportation Authority<br />Local Advisory Committee<br />Feb 10, 2009<br />unofficial notes<br />Edward Vielmetti<br /><br />This is my notes from the LAC meeting of 2/10/09,<br />edited slightly but not intended as a faithful<br />transcript of the meeting.<br /><br />I came in 10 minutes late; the meeting starts at<br />10:00am, and the AATA #6 from downtown gets there<br />at 10:01am. The meeting ends at 12:00 noon; the <br />inbound #6 arrives at 11:58am.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The board discussed Tom Partridge&#39;s comments and reporting on same<br />in the minutes to the previous meeting.<br />He was apparently somewhat disruptive in the meeting,<br />and the meeting minutes attempt to reflect that. Some<br />discussion among the (relatively unprepared) board <br />on how to prepare an accurate reporting of this.<br /><br />&quot;a lot of disorganization going on in the meeting&quot;.<br />apparently tom created a lot of interruptions. he<br />derailed the agenda. (was that his agenda).<br /><br />There is a recording device at the table; is that<br />going to be shared? I don&#39;t know.<br /><br />No one has name tags or table tents showing their names.<br /><br />--<br /><br />chris white<br /><br />AOS calculates schedule adherence for each service at each<br />bus stop. &quot;from our point of view we publish a time point<br />the driver can&#39;t leave before that time&quot;. 57 after the hour.<br />can&#39;t leave before 57. intermediate times keep track of it.<br />trying to publish that information, in a different way,<br />not guarantee . keyed to places where bus can sit. &quot;not<br />beyond the realm of possibility&quot;.<br /><br />real time information move to do it on cell phones. attraction<br />of cell phones is to call up anywhere you want and find<br />the schedule adherence of the next bus. do it in office,<br />on way to office, on bus stop. difficulty of maintaining<br />information at bus stops, struggling with. easier to put it<br />up than it is to maintain it. schedule cases difficult to<br />maintain. a few real time signs at stops, issue of getting<br />power to them. solar power next thing. from our point of view<br />the best option is cell phones. last survey: most riders did<br />have them. limited income, almost all cell.<br /><br />text &#39;AATABUS 6&#39; to 41411<br /><br />detail discussion of time adherence at all stops. leave a little<br />early if traffic is clear.<br /><br />services with cognitive impariments, difficult time riding the bus.<br />difficultiy accessing information.<br />do have support systems, talk to, <br />call taker on the phone, schedule in person, general training.<br />one on one travel training, general mobility education.<br />work with individuals with disabilities.<br />&quot;don&#39;t even use the book, it&#39;s too confusing.&quot;<br />too hard to train on a timetable.<br />best way tot do it is based on locatoin time to be there.<br />individual schedule, prepare it for them.<br /><br />alternate formats, audio cd for indivduals.<br />schedule is read in audio format.<br />on request.<br />large print format.<br /><br />important that need to be worked on.<br />meeting needs of those indivdiuals.<br />systemic basis, right down to the individual.<br /><br />I told the story of going from mary markley to burns park elementary,<br />and how my son in 3d grade was asked to help prepare<br />a route for someone visiting the school. It might be<br />hard if you try to mix University and AATA routes.<br /><br />--<br /><br />problem of getting buses to CIL in the middle of Ann Arbor<br />Research Park. Nothing from the city side. <br /><br />CIL, Social Security moved to research park drive just off<br />of ellsworth road. No sidewalks on S side of Ellsworth,<br />N side no curb and gutter. Very busy, difficult for bus <br />stops, hard to cross. Cross busy road, stand on shoulder.<br />city looking at a signal. S side in Pittsfield Twp no <br />sidewalks until development. A lot of time to cross<br />Ellsworth +5 at the corner. <br /><br />Stimulus package: $200k for bus stops. Added money for<br />urban transit systems, amount up in the air, somewhere<br />between $6 and $8 million, must be spent in 1.5 yrs.<br />Short term: lead walks, benches; sidewalk design work;<br /><br />--<br /><br />Design of park and ride lot at Plymouth Road and US-23,<br />in the interchange at SW quadrant. 300 spaces. P&amp;R<br />plan, 1st thing to do. Intercept traffic before it<br />gets into the more crowded part of Ann Arbor.<br /><br />Internet service is back up and running. Email lost when<br />provider had &quot;financial difficulties&quot;. Now working as<br />a part of the city&#39;s email and internet with the county<br />as well. So far 2 weeks, things working real well. Ridetrak<br />lost at the worst time possible, bad weather, snow and<br />the cold. Really a terrible time, couldn&#39;t have been<br />worse.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Public participation at board committee meetings, PMER,<br />Planning and Development, Governance.<br /><br />1. &quot;Should not be open to the public&quot;. Board did not<br />adopt that as the policy. Communicate those comments<br />to the board. Comment in writing? Committees new, trying<br />to reorganize how the work is done. <br /><br />--<br /><br />New business.<br /><br />Proposal for fare changes. Two phone calls in past three weeks,<br />both not in support of the fare change proposal; affects<br />the people who need the service the most. Make trips less<br />frequently, take less and save up money.<br /><br />Haven&#39;t had any other calls. <br /><br />--<br /><br />people&#39;s express is running now<br /><br />northfield<br />salem<br />superior<br />ypsilanti<br />pittsfield<br />augusta<br />york<br />lodi<br />bridgewater<br />scio (parts of; cdbg funds; $1/ride to go anywhere)<br /><br />anyone can get. all senior centers at least once a year.<br />information on aata web site? not getting the word out.<br />washtenaw county commissioners, some meetings are televised.<br /><br />other places to meet?<br /><br />can aata provide added access to the meeting?<br />podcast, recording, other access.<br />community television network across the street.<br /><br />what would be possible?<br /><br />would podcasting be viewed by more people?<br /><br />don&#39;t want to spend money, just access <br />for what people?<br /><br />can you take the recording? whose recording?<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />end of notes.<br /></pre>
