		<title>Amelanchier (Shadbush, Juneberry, Sugar Plum) inventory for Ann Arbor, 2009</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h3>3 July 2009</h3>
		<h1>Amelanchier (Shadbush, Juneberry, Sugar Plum) inventory for Ann Arbor, 2009</h1> 
		<p>Here&#39;s a complete list of where all of the Amelanchier (juneberry, shadbush, sugar plum depending on where you are from) trees are on the public streets in Ann Arbor.&#0160; The complete inventory shows 356 trees, each geocoded; rather than try to pin them on a map, this is by street name in alphabetical order, with quite a bit of duplicates eliminated.</p>
<p>The whole program to do this is</p>
<p>grep -i Amelanchier trees09.csv | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3, &quot;between&quot;, $4, &quot;and &quot; $5}&#39; | sort | uniq &gt; juneberry.txt</p>
<p>where the trees09.csv file is downloadable from the Ann Arbor Chronicle who originally sourced this data from the city of Ann Arbor; <a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/07/01/city-and-residents-to-make-tree-policy/">see their story about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Alas this post is a little bit too late for this season; by July 2, 2009, many of the juneberry trees are completely ripe, so get picking.</p>
