      <p>Today is a Twitter conference, so Twitter is full of good stuff people have been saving up.&#0160; Here&#39;s one: a &quot;conversation prism&quot; in bright happy colors showing a set of categories of tools, and how each one of them is occupied by some set of applications.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mapping of each of them onto the set of tools that I am using to keep a2b3 loosely connected.&#0160;
Sorry no links, didn&#39;t have time to hyperlink everything <a href="http://theconversationprism.com" title="The Conversation Prism by Brian Solis and Jesse Thomas"><img src="http://theconversationprism.com/convoprismembed.jpg" style="border: 0px solid #666666;" /></a></p><p>The Conversation Prism by <a href="http://briansolis.com">Brian Solis</a> and <a href="http://jess3.com">Jesse Thomas</a></p>
<br /><p><br />Forums: Yahoo Groups</p><p>This is the biggest single tool I use for group continuity; it perhaps reflects my elderly nature that email is the first system rather than web-based forums or modern social networks.&#0160; All I can say in my defense is that Usenet would have been better but it&#39;s really not available, and that I have 10 years of continuous use into Yahoo Groups and they haven&#39;t ruined it (yet).</p><p>Social networks: Facebook (intermittently)</p><p>Facebook will show up here frequently, if only because it&#39;s ubiquitous and because Ann Arbor is full of people who use it.&#0160; My sense is that its group tools are way weaker than its personal tools and so it&#39;s best used as an adjunct to the main Yahoo group just so you can attach names to faces and so you can promote events.</p><p>&quot;Interest and curated networks&quot; (?): LinkedIn</p><p>I&#39;m not sure about the category, but LinkedIn certainly qualifies as one ongoing conversation starting and continuing tool.&#0160; Like Facebook, groups are second class objects in LinkedIn, and thus it&#39;s weak at building cohesion.&#0160; On the plus side you don&#39;t have to pretend to be someone&#39;s pal to look up their resume.</p><p>Reviews and ratings: Yahoo Groups, Arborwiki</p><p>There are a bunch of national scale review sites, but nothing beats asking a good sized group of your peers for recommendations on everything from programming language libraries to pest control.&#0160; To whatever extent possible, Arborwiki becomes the public long term storage for what would otherwise be something ephemeral and hard to retrieve through the Yahoo Groups search interface.</p><p>Location: none; I gave up on Plaxo when it creeped me out</p><p>Location-based mobile services are supposed to be the future of the social mobile web, but I lived through having my location visible on Plaxo and decided against living that way when people who knew where I was without me telling them didn&#39;t have the social clues not to be obvious that they were watching me.&#0160;&#0160; If I want to tell you where I am I&#39;ll be explicit about it on Twitter, or you can just wonder.</p><p>Video: whatever people use</p><p>There are a couple of filmmakers in the group, and I respect their judgement what to use for video.&#0160; None of the video tools have strong group membership characteristics - or even particularly weak ones - so I treat them all pretty much interchangably as dumb hosting.&#0160; (And no, I don&#39;t particular care if any given short video clip goes viral.)</p><p>Customer Service: Get Satisfaction, but it&#39;s not quite right</p><p>If a2b3 was a business it might need customer support, but it&#39;s not, and Get Satisfaction is just extra baggage.&#0160; Tried it, it seemed to be functional, but not for the problem at hand.</p><p>Documents/Content: SlideShare seems to be a favorite</p><p>Those people who are giving presentations seem to have settled on SlideShare as a common denominator for hosting.&#0160; The weekly lunches don&#39;t feature presentations so there&#39;s no natural synchronization around it as a tool, but it works as advertised.</p><p>Events: upcoming, Facebook events, in-person lunch w/announcements</p><p>Events are perhaps the hardest nut to crack, the thing that would make you spend all week promoting other people&#39;s work and the like.&#0160; I have been telling people who don&#39;t have URLs for events to post them to upcoming; Facebook will tell you about more parties than you can manage to go to; and there&#39;s nothing like someone telling you about something around the table.&#0160; The only way to really lick the events question is to have someone full time collecting them.</p><p>Music: One each of everything; I&#39;m fond of how blip.fm twitters out songs</p><p>blip.fm is the closest thing to Napster that&#39;s out there; do a Twitter search for your favorite artist plus the word &quot;blip&quot; and you may be lucky enough to find a fellow fan and a track you can listen to.&#0160;&#0160; YouTube is also really good for songs - my 4 y/o calls it &quot;picture music&quot;.</p><p>Wiki: Arborwiki, plus my own private Socialtext space</p><p>Arborwiki is the designated spot for dropping in information that deserves to live in a wiki; the &quot;Birthday Deals&quot; page there is the one universal attraction point around which much of the rest lives.&#0160; I keep a Socialtext private wiki for my own personal memory augmentation tool, in part because it works awesomely on my Blackberry.</p><p>Livecasting video: haven&#39;t done it yet, not appropriate for lunch</p><p>If you want to join in to lunch, you don&#39;t want to watch it remotely; the space isn&#39;t set up for that.&#0160; If and when I get to a place where regular live video streaming makes sense I&#39;ll use whatever the cool kids are using then.</p><p>Pictures: Flickr, Facebook photos</p><p>Once upon a time Flickr was a dynamic photo community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly creative people who you really wanted to share pictures with.&#0160; Then everything grew up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and my camera died.&#0160; Now if I want to share a photo I&#39;m more likely to put it on Facebook.&#0160; I miss the old Flickr.</p><p>Social bookmarks: Delicious, plus whatever Les is working on</p><p>Once upon a time Delicious was a dynamic bookmark community, with dozens of awesome funny friendly smart people who you really wanted to share bookmarks with.&#0160; Then everything group up, people left for greener pastures, Yahoo acted stupid more than once, and Twitter came along.&#0160; Now if I want to share a link I think twice and either twitter it out or work it into a longer blog post.&#0160; I just hope my 10,000 bookmarks stick around for a long time.</p><p>Comment and reputation: plenty of that around the lunch table</p><p>There&#39;s enough people who I care to converse with that I know by face and name that the level of comment-tracking promoted by blog tools seems irrelevant, for the most part, or at least too much work.</p><p>Crowdsourced content: arborwiki, a2geeks</p><p>Both arborwiki and a2geeks have enough of a wiki platform running for general and for technical info that if you need to crowdsource something there&#39;s a place to point people toward to edit things.</p><p>Collaboration: Google Spreadsheets (for football parking info)</p><p>If I need to collect a bunch of numbers from a bunch of people, Google Spreadsheets seems to do pretty well.&#0160; I love wiki for private collaboration, but you have to be collaborating with people who love it too.&#0160; Otherwise, printing things out and letting someone else wrestle with tracking changes in Microsoft Word is about as good as I get.</p><p>Blog platforms: Typepad</p><p>Someone else worries about it and I just hit &quot;post&quot;.</p><p>Blogs/conversations: Google Blog Search is the best of a bad lot</p><p>It&#39;s hard to track conversations in blogs, in part because the blog vs comment distinction is weird.&#0160; It&#39;s just as easy to do regular Google searches and put in teh word &quot;blog&quot; as an added qualifier.</p><p>Blog communities: mybloglog</p><p>I&#39;m using this mostly for stats and to detect one-day spikes that mean that some seasonal post is current again or to notice when something is on fire.</p><p>Micromedia: Twitter</p><p>twitter, duh.&#0160; </p><p>Twitter ecosystems: trying out Cotweet</p><p>I have a beta account; it&#39;s working pretty well to do future scheduled postings and to better track responses.&#0160; Not sure yet if and how to open up the @a2b3 account to multiple posters but that&#39;s the next obvious thing.</p><p>SMS/Voice: Google Voice</p><p>It converts voice mail to text so that I don&#39;t have to listen to all of my voice mail.&#0160; Still in closed beta.</p><p>Lifestreams: get a life!&#0160; need some privacy sometime</p><p>Part of living a life is deciding what to broadcast to the Internet and what to keep quiet.&#0160; I&#39;m just as happy to be offline as online, and the idea that you should soulcast every last mood swing seems to be as unproductive as it gets</p><p>----</p><p>After working my way through this, I realize what it&#39;s missing - all of these apps I write about are apps that work on a big screen.&#0160; The real conversation prism also includes a parallel set of augmented reality supported by mobile devices, and that very well may include entirely new categories than above.</p>
