      <p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 25.0px; font: 18.0px Arial; background-color: #dcdcdc">Brian Marick on <a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2009/02/04/getting-invited-to-speak-part-1/">How to get invited to conferences:</a></p><blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; ">Someone asked me for advice on how to get invited to speak at conferences. &#0160;Key advice:</span></p></blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc"><li><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; ">become a valuable participant in a niche field,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; ">grow along with the niche,</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: normal; font-size: 18px; ">become a good speaker.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>&#0160;</span>&#0160;There&#39;s more, of course; there&#39;s always more; it&#39;s a good discussion of how he found a growing niche and helped popularize it in part by viewing things from a novel perspective.</p><ul style="list-style-type: disc"></p>

<p></ul>
<div>That discussion pointed to this essay by <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/leader.html">Phil Agre on How To Be A Leader In Your Field</a> (2005), aimed at grad students. &#0160;He has a six part recipe (more pointless numbered lists; but you understand that as a grounding principle) on how to do it. &#0160;Starkly abstracted:</div><div><ol>
<li><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Times">Pick an issue. You need an issue that the profession as a whole is not really thinking about, but which is going to be the center of attention in five years.&#0160;</p></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Having chosen your issue, start a project to study it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Find relevant people and talk to them. First do your library work so you know any conventional wisdom that&#39;s out there. Then talk to some working professionals who are facing the issue, especially if they have spoken publicly about an aspect of it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Pull together what you&#39;ve heard. Nobody is expecting you to solve the problems.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Circulate the result. Send copies to the people who helped you. Call it a draft or interim report if you want. Give credit to the people whose ideas you&#39;ve written down. Then follow up.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span style="font-family: Times; line-height: normal; ">Build on your work. Get invited to speak at meetings. Correspond with people who have contacted you after reading your work.</span>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</li>
</ol>
<span>Note that Agre&#39;s list has five steps before the &quot;speak at meetings&quot;, and that Marick&#39;s list only has&#0160;</span>&#0160;two; you can chalk up most of that to the need in grad school to engage in more ritual behavior vs. the practitioner who is just looking to talk about something novel to the people who want to hear something novel.<br /></div><br /><div>&ndash;</div><br /><div>I write about this stuff all the time, because in part I think about the tag line this blog has now (&quot;I am a leader by default, because nature abhors a vacuum&quot;) and how it reflects on the leadership role of seeing something not yet there and working at it until it is real enough for others to take as their own. &#0160;Hard to say that this is an easy path to do - if you are too scatterbrained you have dozens of projects that are not quite full formed and you never get to the expert level - but there is something to be said for the notion that this is something which you or anyone can do by simple application of diligence and leverage in some small gap in the structure of how the world currently is.</div></p>
