      <p>day 9 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>A new newspaper showed up on my sidewalk yesterday afternoon; I&#39;m not going to name it by name, but let&#39;s just call it the A2 Gerbil.&#0160; It was a happy little paper, full of happy little stories about quaint things happening in some leafy town somewhere near here.&#0160; It took me a couple of minutes to leaf through it and a few more minutes to hunt down the web site for it and appreciate some of its finer points.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I&#39;d pick on the newspaper itself, but you can&#39;t see it unless you live here.&#0160; Like its namesake, it leaves droppings on sidewalks, and if you walk through my neighborhood you&#39;ll notice in a few blocks half a dozen houses that didn&#39;t bother to pick it up, and if you walk down Packard you&#39;ll notice that most houses didn&#39;t manage to pick it up.&#0160; Unsolicited free drop media of all kinds generates litter - in student neighborhoods you perpetually step over rotting copies of the Wall Street Journal delivered but unread.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>There were the usual collection of small town newspaper typoes - spelling mistakes in the body copy, and one I noticed in a headline.&#0160; People make mistakes, but if you&#39;re going to the trouble of printing them, you&#39;d hope there were enough people in the production process and enough spell checking tools to catch them.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>The web site is a charming example of what newspaper web sites looked before RSS feeds made it possible to syndicate news and read it (minus the ads) in a feed reader.&#0160; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a deliberate, calculated design decision, or an omission.&#0160; The one indication that you have that a story is new is a blinking NEW! icon.&#0160; (really)</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>Some of the headlines on the web site could use some work.&#0160; &quot;Construction under way&quot;; that&#39;s not helpful.&#0160; &quot;Ann Arbor&#39;s many distinctions&quot;; that could run every week.&#0160; &quot;Neighbors get their way&quot;; a hint of controversy, I suppose, but again that looks like an every issue column and not really a headline.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>It&#39;s tough being a photo editor, but really, when you print pictures of people in a parade, it would be really nice to get their names, so that you could say who they were so that someone could clip and send the photo to them.&#0160; It just looks weird to see a caption like &quot;Someone is walking in a parade&quot; with no idea who it is.</p><p><a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Newani" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c " src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef011570fe639b970c-800wi" title="Newani" /></a> </p><p>I hate to poke at someone&#39;s new enterprise, in part because I&#39;m involved in a new enterprise, and it might have some aspects of it in the first issue that aren&#39;t 100% glorious.&#0160; I&#39;m sure that the Gerbil, and its owners at the esteemed Gerbil-Hamster Corporation, is the product of a lot of hard work.&#0160; Alas, it doesn&#39;t say anything about the town I live in - it&#39;s like a picture-perfect mirror to some sleepy parallel universe town where everything is kind of nice in a boring kind of way.&#0160; </p>
