      <p>Previously: <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/07/paper-plastic-o.html">Paper, plastic or burlap (2008)</a></p><p><a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/03/no_action_on_plasticbag_ban.html">The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags.</a> As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">There&#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member
Stephen Rapundalo, who&#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the
council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a
vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said.</p><p><a href="http://annarborchronicle.com/2009/03/06/city-council-and-the-values-of-ann-arbor/">The Ann Arbor Chronicle gives many more details in its account of the council meeting:</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rapundalo moved for a postponement to June 1 to allow city staff to
have a little more time to take in information and to have a discussion
with retailers. Rapundalo asked Bryan Weinert, the solid-waste
coordinator for the city of Ann Arbor, to give an update on staff
efforts. Weinert said that on March 22-23 staff would be meeting with
retailers to get feedback on the already-drafted ordinance. He said
there would be information on city’s website and a public information
survey, acknowledging that there was some controversy surrounding the
issue.&#0160; Weinert said that based on feedback from the public and
merchants, staff would bring forward a recommendation. Weinert did not
state what the range of possibilities for such a recommendation would
be.</p><p>Plastic bag manufacturers are not immune to the current economic stress; <a href="http://hilexpoly.com/news/single/article/hilex-poly-announces-agreement-to-restructure-debt-15//nbp/170.html">one leading manufacturer, Hilex Poly, just went through Ch. 11 bankruptcy (restructuring of debt) in 2008.</a></p><p class="bodytext" style="margin-left: 40px;">HARTSVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA – May 6, 2008 – Hilex
Poly Co., LLC, (&quot;Hilex&quot; or &quot;the Company&quot;), the world’s largest plastic
bag company, today announced that it has reached an agreement with its
lenders to restructure its senior secured debt. Hilex is taking this
action to significantly reduce its overall debt and strengthen its
balance sheet to better serve its customers and continue its market
leadership position in the plastic bag industry. In addition to a
substantial reduction in outstanding debt, the plan will reduce annual
interest expense and significantly improve cash flow. </p><p class="bodytext">Coincidentally, <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutplasticbags.com/">Hilex Poly also publishes a web site called &quot;The Truth About Plastic Bags&quot;, </a>which is unvarnished pro-plastic bag propaganda; I won&#39;t quote from it, but if you want the plastics side of the story, here it is.&#0160; </p><p class="bodytext"><a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=7572">Dart Container of Mason, MI opposed the Palo Alto plastics ban</a> by astroturfing letters to city council there in 2008.&#0160; The Palo Alto Online News picked up the story:</p><p class="bodytext">
</p>
<p class="story_text" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;We don&#39;t think there&#39;s a full understanding of
what we believe the facts to be,&quot; Dart spokesman Jim Lammers said
Thursday. He confirmed his company had sponsored the letter campaign, a
tactic it has used in other communities considering bans. </p>

<p><p class="story_text" style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;The issues surrounding the ban are much more
nuanced and complicated than I think people realize and the stated
goals to be achieved by these bans are not going to be realized by
selecting as the target of the ban foam products,&quot; Lammers said. </p><p>Whole Foods has gone to all paper bags, and is offering $0.10 per bag credit for reuse - the same as Michigan deposit cans.&#0160; Their bags are made by <a href="http://www.durobag.com">Duro</a>, based in northern Kentucky with manufacturing plants around the country.&#0160; <a href="http://www.durobag.com/news/permalink/2007/10/23/160302.html">Their PR behind the launch of the bag</a> claims</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 40px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; line-height: 115%;"><font size="2">&#0160;Duro’s
100% Recycled Paper Bag is exclusive to North America and is made from
60% Post Industrial and 40% Post Consumer fibers. The larger <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> size
bag helps with source reduction at the checkout counter, as it allows
for more items. By applying more adhesive surface the wider, stand up
handles provide additional carrying strength. <br /></font></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black; line-height: 115%;"><font size="2"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> size is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub> of a barrel; you can get <a href="http://www.instawares.com/duro-natural-1-6-barrel-paper-bags-57-12-x-7-x-17-sk1657.bagsk1657.0.7.htm?LID=GGLE&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=BAGSK1657">500 similar bags made by Duro from Instawares for $70 + shipping </a>which works out to about $0.14 per bag (making the $0.10 bag credit an easy sell).<br /></font></span></p><br /><br /><br /></p>
