		<h3>9 July 2009</h3>
		<h1>a2b3 lunch non-summary, day 8</h1> 
		<p>day 8 of notes on my new job at <a href="http://annarbor.com">annarbor.com</a></p><p>Almost every week for the last 4 years I&#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers.&#0160; Repetition makes it a bit easier.</p><p>Most weeks I try, or at least intend to try, to put together some notes about lunch.&#0160; Now that I&#39;m no longer just an experienced blogger but also a fledgling analog journalist, I took some notes; these are incomplete, but they are more complete than I normally do.&#0160; I&#39;m hoping to get better at note-taking as time goes on.&#0160; </p><p>People go around the table and introduce themselves; I asked people to say a few words about what&#39;s going on for them.&#0160; This list below links in most cases to people&#39;s or organizations Arborwiki pages, since that lets me edit and fill in some of the blanks later or to have some of the blanks already filled in.</p><p>In order of how I wrote them down, with a simple question: what did you notice this week?&#0160; Apologies if I got anything wrong or incomplete, and I know there are incomplete bits here.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Patricia_Anderson">Patricia Anderson</a> - U of Michigan emerging technologies librarian - talked about some meetings she was at with folks at the U looking at getting UM communications people engaged in social media; the good story was about introducing people for the first time to SlideShare.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/Linda_Diane_Feldt">Linda Diane Feldt</a> - holistic health practitioner - spoke about foraging, and teaching people about where to find black raspberries and wondering why more people weren&#39;t out picking them.</p><p><a href="http://arborwiki.org/city/David_C._Bloom">David C.
