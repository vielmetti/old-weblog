		<title>LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books</title> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books</h1> 
		<p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.</p>
<p>The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.</p>
<p>Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. The Canton District Library does have an installation of LibraryThing for Libraries, their OPAC integration product, which lets you check availability of a book straight from LibraryThing. The lack of a direct link means that to find a book in the AADL that I have on my screen in LibraryThing I have to click a few more times. I suppose that&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to tag and categorize books that you don&#39;t own yourself, but only have collected them from the library? There was a time when I tagged things everywhere I found them - photos on Flickr, web sites on Delicious - but these days that doesn&#39;t seem so important. I like seeing other people&#39;s tags, especially for works that are unfamiliar, but it hardly seems essential to do it for my own use unless there&#39;s some list I&#39;m trying to put together. When did tagging cease being fun?</p>
<p>I&#39;m spending some of my time on the site deleting books that I no longer even remember having read or that I no longer wish to remember. That should result in better recommendations, and maybe a chance to reread something that would have been worth remembering. My use of the site peaked in 2008 so there&#39;s not as much recent coverage as I&#39;d like.</p>
<p>The recommendations from LibraryThing are really quite good, and they are even better for reflecting which of the books you&#39;ve already read. The site generates ten recommendations based on other people&#39;s reading patterns, and it reminds you that you&#39;ve read some of the ones on that list with a checkmark.</p>
<p>I wish I read more books and fewer web pages.</p>

	Recreating more or less my original layout, but with 
	dynamically loaded content. I guess that could work!
