Maitri has a great write-up of Map Warper, a tool for taking old maps and stretching them (rectifying them) to match another base map.&amp;#0160; Tim Waters has developed an open source tool called Map Warper (Beta) into which you can upload a scanned map, georectify it and save it out as an image or a map layer.&amp;#0160; As a former resident of New Orleans, where a transparent recovery and historic preservation are daily uphill battles, this tool can be invaluable in saving and sharing ancient and new maps of the cityâ€™s original development and re-development since Hurricane Katrina and The Flood.</description>
