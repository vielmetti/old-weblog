      <description>Google&#39;s Street View has come to Ann Arbor. From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon. The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi&#39;s toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.

Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.</description>
