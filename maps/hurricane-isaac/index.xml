      <description>Hurricane Isaac brought with it high winds and a substantial amount of rain, and both of those combined has led to a lot of flooding. Here are some maps I&amp;#39;ve collected while the storm is still underway. You should know that for each of them I&amp;#39;ll also give a link to the underlying mapping source so that you can get current information.
If you are in the affected area and need details about flooded roads or the risk of dams or levees bursting or anything else, do not trust this weblog for current information; seek out official and up to date sources.</description>
