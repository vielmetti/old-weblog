      <description>At a previous employer&#39;s previous location, my office was on a street (Depot St) regularly used to speed through town. Every day people would zoom to and from the hospital, and every day the AAPD would stop some fraction of them to give them tickets. I was glad for it too - to cross Depot when cars are barreling along at 45 in a 30 zone was not fun.</description>
