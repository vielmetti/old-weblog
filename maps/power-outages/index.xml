      <description>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility company. I know it won&amp;rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies have at least one county that they only provide service to part of), but as a start it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good one.</description>

      <description>The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit by severe storms the evening of October 2, 2014. The Dallas Morning News live blog details the impact, with more than 250,000 people without power.
This outage map from about 7:00 p.m. that evening shows the extent of the damage.

My power outage tracker page is a good early warning of problems with the power grid. By looking at what web pages people are clicking through on, I can see where the troubles are.</description>

      <description>The ice storm of late December 2013 hit the Lansing area hard, and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting outages as well as citizens would have them do. The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL, the Lansing Board of Water and Light. Even though the surrounding area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing, LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively unusual in this day and age.</description>

      <description>Whenever the power goes out, there&#39;s a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on.
Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what&#39;s going on - there&#39;s a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.</description>
