      <description>The Detroit area SMART bus system now has routing and schedule information in Google Transit. It gives bus numbers and times for rides across the metro Detroit area, and plans the next available trips for you.  With all of this data it now looks almost possible to schedule and plan transportation from Ann Arbor to large parts of metro Detroit on public transportation. Mind you it&amp;rsquo;s a little roundabout, but you have two choices:  - take Amtrak Ann Arbor - Detroit - Royal Oak - Pontiac, 3 trips/day - take the Michigan Flyer bus to Metro Airport, switch to a SMART bus, and connect to routes from there - allow plenty of time for transfers and to find your stops.</description>

      <title>AATA proposed route changes for Fall 2008, preliminary analysis</title>

      <description>The AATA has announced proposed changes to the schedule for this fall. New maps and schedules are not out yet, but there are descriptions of the changes. Here&#39;s a breakdown of what wins and what loses with the change.  There&#39;s more information and discussion of this on: - Arbor Update - Get Downtown - Ann Arbor News - Ann Arbor Is Overrated links to follow when they all get around to writing about it  The short summary, I think, is that the bus system is shifting its service to improve route frequency to the west side of town, cutting service on routes that have low ridership, and shaving a trip here and there.</description>
