      <title>lob a postcard: printer sends cards via API</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lob.com has an API to send postcards-as-a-service ($0.70 per each,
full custom both sides). Details at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lob.com/services/postcards&#34;&gt;https://lob.com/services/postcards&lt;/a&gt; .
It works, but all of the user interface is up to you; if you know
a good service for delivering a single full-custom postcard with
postage that actually has a user interface and not an API for less
than $1.00 each, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll update here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>espresso over ice with a little half and half</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A simple recipe that you can order from your favorite barista:
an espresso shot over ice. Leave enough room to add a spot of
half and half. Cold, refreshing, and very strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try: a shot of espresso over shaved ice. I think this is
doable at Ann Arbor Farmers Market where you&amp;rsquo;d go to the stall
where a granny is selling shaved ice, and then walk a plain snow cone
over to the Roos Roast stand for your espresso shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a Facebook post from Allen Leibowitz in Texas ordering a snow cone
and the surrounding commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The weak ties of your social network are its greatest strength</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-weak-ties-of-your-social-network/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lior Zoref has a new book out called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1471756&#34;&gt;Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything&lt;/a&gt;
(Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have
a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the
new shelf at Mallett&amp;rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday
afternoon. Mallett&amp;rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot
to be on a warm day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://media.aadl.org/covers/1471756_200.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits
without repeating the author&amp;rsquo;s technique of using the word
&amp;ldquo;Mindsharing&amp;rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to
unpack the approach with a simpler version of the
strategy, which seems to boil down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make lots of connections online, even with people who you don&amp;rsquo;t
know very well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them really good questions when you are trying to make a decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of connections is the biggest suggestion here; rather than
get help from a small circle of trusted friends, the crowdsourcing
approach to human improvement relies on good ideas coming from
large or very large sets of people (at least 250), and relies on
pulling in unexpectedly good recommendations from people who don&amp;rsquo;t
know you very well.  Lior references Mark Granovetter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Strength
of Weak Ties&amp;rdquo; (1973) early on, but of course Granovetter didn&amp;rsquo;t
know about Quora, Facebook, LinkedIn, and the host of other online
properties and lists that allow for computer-mediated interaction
with people at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an art to asking good questions that could fill a book.
If you look on the biggest question-answering websites like Quora
or Stack Exchange and start to follow along, you will quickly find
that good questions get rewarded with positive feedback and bad
questions (or impossible to answer questions) get ignored or criticized.
Lior points out the there&amp;rsquo;s a very big difference between typing a query
into a search engine and asking a live audience the same thing -
the human element of the search allows a personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lior is known for a TED talk (he brought an ox onstage) and is out
promoting his book. The book itself feels like an ideal airplane
read for someone who is aspiring to self-improvement, is facing a
career change, and who hasn&amp;rsquo;t figured out what the point is quite
yet with Facebook as a career tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes on the Midland G-227 GMRS/FRS radio</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-midland-g-227/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2015 11:52:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-midland-g-227/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Midland G-227 GMRS radio, quantity two, a gift from the
Wells-Becker Motorcycle Emporium in Dexter, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced batteries in both of them, they take 4xAAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio 1 successfully hears static when the (M) monitor
button is depresssed; Radio 2 hears nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manual is at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html&#34;&gt;http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html&lt;/a&gt;
which describes the frequencies of the 22 channels it can transmit on.
A reasonable next step is to get my NooElec SDR tuner out and see if
I can monitor a transmission. If Radio 2 transmits, I suspect a loose
connection to the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Midland-G-227C2-7-Mile-22-Channel-Two-Way/dp/B00008JOMG&#34;&gt;Amazon reviews&lt;/a&gt;
complain mostly that the range of the radios is not &amp;ldquo;7 miles&amp;rdquo; as
marketed, but closer to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mile to 1 mile on land. That&amp;rsquo;s typical
for this band as I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same gift also a Uniden labelled &amp;ldquo;Scramble&amp;rdquo; that has a NOAA
weather logo on it, so it probably also monitors weather frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can never have too many radios!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>food coop notes for July 18, 2015</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2015 14:23:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some notes over a cup of coffee and some cold roast chicken. I need
to mix up my menu selections at the coop more so that I can remember
what I was writing by what I ate; I usually eat the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain were here at the coop, doing
the NY Times crossword. (Saturday crossword in 36:05, a mid-day triumph.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Market: cherries, parsley, kale, potatoes, dill, tomatoes.
The potatoes will be boiled and dressed with a dill vinaigrette.
(I had to look up the word vinaigrette.) The recipes I found add
green beans and boiled eggs to a salad with cold potatoes, using
a mustard vinaigrette with added chopped dill. The cherries will
probably just be eaten out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UP travel discussion included the obligatory discussion of insects,
including ticks (&amp;ldquo;like bedbugs, for the woods&amp;rdquo;) and horrible sand
flies that will swarm you and leave you screaming running from the
beach. There&amp;rsquo;s a good reason that the UP has miles of undeveloped beaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t mention bugs in the UP without remembering
&lt;a href=&#34;http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/&#34;&gt;The Backyard Arthropod Project&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;ldquo;A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI&amp;rdquo;,
by Tim Eisele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still hacking away at generating interesting reports from
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist&#34;&gt;stringdist&lt;/a&gt;
package from Mark van der Loo. Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post was
&lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31486913/r-producing-a-list-of-near-matches-with-stringdist-and-stringdistmatrix&#34;&gt;R: producing a list of near matches with stringdist and stringdistmatrix&lt;/a&gt; and the answers provided
helped unearth the melt() function from the reshape2 library,
and with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you take a matrix and turn it into an edge list.
A little bit of filtering, and you get a report of near matches
in a list, enough for me to catch variant spellings of
vinagrette to vinaigrette in a &amp;ldquo;make test&amp;rdquo; step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow was fun for this task, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try it again.
The process of describing your problem in enough detail that someone
who knows the issue can add the one or two lines of code to make
it work is a useful exercise. It&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of a search
engine in many ways - of course I could find melt() once I know
its name, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the name you can&amp;rsquo;t find anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit of interestingness has to do with turning the dist
data structure returned by stringdist into a variety of useful
images. There&amp;rsquo;s a package that dumps out a &amp;ldquo;dendogram&amp;rdquo;, and if I&amp;rsquo;m
careful in formatting the data I think I can coerce R into producing
data that can be imported directly into the tools that
Valdis Krebs
has written for network exploration and visualization. The
promise within R is a &amp;ldquo;distgraph&amp;rdquo; that does the visualization,
but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet finding the cadre of experts who use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art on the walls is Julie Marron-Parker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sunburst&amp;rdquo;. She writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the sun shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in Michigan (160 days of sun per year) I have come to
appreciate when the sun is out. This piece brings the energy of the
sun into the world, regardless of the weather outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Meloche writes about &lt;a href=&#34;http://tommeloche.com/the-doorway-effect/&#34;&gt;the doorway effect&lt;/a&gt;,
where going through a doorway wipes out your short term memory
to make way for new short term memories. It got me thinking
about the memory palace
, and how you might construct
in your mind a series of portals and doorways to walk through so
that you can remember a series of items in such a way that you
take advantage of the doorway effect to pull memories in and out
of your short term thinking. The technology is &amp;ldquo;mnemotechnics&amp;rdquo;,
that&amp;rsquo;s a good keyword to pull lots of interesting thinking
(which sometimes sounds like crazytalk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That reminds me - I need to move to another room, so that I can
remember what I need to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Levenshtein distance for approximate match</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-17-levenshtein-distance-for-approximate-match/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 16:11:41 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-17-levenshtein-distance-for-approximate-match/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem, simply stated, is that of typoes and inconsistent
spelling and pluraliziation. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a collection of
text that you want to annotate with some metadata, like categories
and tags. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to set aside ahead of time exactly which
tags you want to use, but you want to catch through some test or
lint step that you&amp;rsquo;ve done something wrong by typing &amp;ldquo;apples&amp;rdquo; into
a field that really has &amp;ldquo;apple&amp;rdquo; most of the time. A good algorithm
will catch minor deviations from the norm and advise you when you
should go back with a fresh pair of eyes and do an edit.
The bigger problem is
deduplication
.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first pass at a proposed solution was to look for a version of
the old Unix program &amp;ldquo;uniq&amp;rdquo; that would have an approximate match.
There is also an old Unix program &amp;ldquo;agrep&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;approximate grep&amp;rdquo;) from
Udi Manber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[WM92a]
Wu S. and U. Manber, &amp;ldquo;Agrep - A Fast Approximate Pattern-Matching
Tool,&amp;rdquo; Usenix Winter 1992 Technical Conference, San Francisco (January
1992), pp. 153-162.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these first lines of attack to see if someone had
completely solved the problem before did the trick, but some
searching around and a conversation with
John Hritz

hit the neuron that remembered the algorithm called the
Levenshtein distance
.
That led me to
Wikibook: Algorithm Implementation
,
and its set of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Levenshtein_distance&#34;&gt;Levenshtein distance code&lt;/a&gt;. It so happened that there
was a very slow implementation in the bash shell included
in that collection that was a cut and paste and two lines of
code from being exactly what I needed. A little bit of glue
code in awk and I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the problem with cut and paste two lines of code is that this
particular implmentation is very slow, albeit correct. Given the
choice between slow correct code and fast code that&amp;rsquo;s wrong (because
of the bug that you don&amp;rsquo;t yet understand), I&amp;rsquo;ll take the slow code
plus a comment and a writeup that describes how to make it faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m really after is just the pairwise comparison of a set
of words where the two words are close to each other. If the
distance between two words is greater than some threshhold, I don&amp;rsquo;t need
to go any further. That algorithmic shortcut isn&amp;rsquo;t in the library
codes that I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger question is how to write a
checklist
and implement it in code to make sure that a big body of work stays
internally consistent. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to have a
categorization
rule for your writers that says &amp;ldquo;always use the
singular&amp;rdquo;, but very much something different to have Test 38 in
your automated test corpus apply that rule and notice when it&amp;rsquo;s
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Detroit Sound Conservancy went to the vacant Book Building
in Detroit on July 7, 2015 to salvage the collection of the
defunct Graystone International Jazz Museum. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice
writeup in MLive, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2015/07/non-profit_group_salvages_detr.html&#34;&gt;Graystone jazz artifacts, forgotten in Detroit skyscraper, now being preserved&lt;/a&gt;. Photographer Doug Coombe went along
to document the effort with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.896394770433897.1073741832.170165396390175&amp;amp;type=3&#34;&gt;photo set on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We knew that things were bad,&amp;rdquo; said DSC&amp;rsquo;s Founder and President
Carleton Gholz about the neglected collection, but Gholz didn&amp;rsquo;t
know how bad until he discovered many of the former museum&amp;rsquo;s records
were broken and strewn across the floor. Historic band stands thrown
into a pile and historic concert posters and sheet music left
unprotected to the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more on the DSC and its work and to get involved, see the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://detroitsoundconservancy.org/&#34;&gt;Detroit Sound Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re writing away, and you hit &amp;ldquo;publish&amp;rdquo;, and the thing
you pieced together flings its way through the ether to some
audience, real or imagined. The next day it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible
to find again unless you manage to produce the precise incantation
into a search engine. There is some long-lasting trail, to be sure,
easy enough to dredge up if someone is motivated by money or curiousity,
but for the most part the social networks of today (Facebook,
Twitter) generate most of their energy from capturing the attention of the
moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what I write here is
worthwhile to save for longer than a day, and
some would be best to be deleted and never seen again.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy though that I have it all in one place that I
can grep through, happy that I can make changes to it
easily enough, and happy that it can be deleted or unpublished
without much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move
a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over
categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same;
the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that
look different. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should
be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of posts about books in the collection, which
should be connected to a lookup for that book in your favorite
bookstore or my favorite library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of people mentioned, and a people index would
be great so you can browse and not just search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m after improving the browsing experience, as much for
me as for anyone else. If you have to find things with a search
engine, you are stuck in a world where you have to know that something
has a particular name. By offering a browsing infrastructure first,
you cherrypick the best search terms and put them up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this will need pen and paper design&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a2b3 lunch at Ayse&#39;s, Art Fair 2015 edition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eight of us met for lunch at &lt;a href=&#34;http://aysesturkishcafe.com/&#34;&gt;Ayse&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; today. It was a normal
Thursday in that regard, as that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty typical size for
the lunch group these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time
to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning
or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a
remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make
sure that the things that needed to get done got done. Among the
tasks that took up lots more time than they deserved included
dealing with the health insurance marketplace and with other
healthcare providers for dealing with billing and accounting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the people at lunch were new to the table, but since Ann
Arbor is bascially a small town, it was not a surprise to me that
I had easily identifiable mutual friends with two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food was delicious, well prepared and well presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week we&amp;rsquo;ll be back at &lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Madras_Masala&#34;&gt;Madras Masala&lt;/a&gt;, as art fair will have
ended and town will be more back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big event coming up is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makerfairedetroit.com/&#34;&gt;Maker Faire Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, to be held at The
Henry Ford in Dearborn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>diligently editing and converting for production</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-15-diligently-editing-and-converting-for-production/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best to get this blog ready for production.
The tasks remaining include the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a reasonable home page with pagination. Somehow I need
to provide some kind of access to almost 2000 posts, and they
don&amp;rsquo;t all fit on a single page. Sort through the design to make
old things reachable, and then worry next about the formatter.
(This is done at least minimally, though the provided paginator
interface uses a list structure that&amp;rsquo;s not nice. Still, it gets
me to what I need to in a ping.) Open discussion on gohugo is
&lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441/3&#34;&gt;Pagination and group by date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publish to Github Pages, using vielmetti.github.io. I did this
once (using Octopress) so it should be straightforward to do it again.
I already do have a proper github repo (or nearly proper, it may
be missing some key bits). Done; don&amp;rsquo;t have a perfect build script
yet, but there&amp;rsquo;s at least a start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Import all sorts more nonsense here, including a bunch of Superpatron
and Blogger&amp;rsquo;s Secret and FOIA Coordiator weblogs. There&amp;rsquo;s no particular
reason not to make it all one big soup. Import from Typepad is problematic
but not impossible and that would be a good addition to the supported work;
in particular it&amp;rsquo;s not evidently possible to export Markdown from Typepad,
just HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sort out theme issues so that I get a reasonable display for category
and subcategory pages. I may have to write some things down by hand
to get an understanding of what I really want. As it is right now
those pages render as blank, in part because I need to convert a bunch
of data imperfectly imported, which was throwing errors in my
templates, which in turn was breaking the build. Dealing with the
errored out builds is a question again for gohugo,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/taxononomy/1445&#34;&gt;taxononomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deal with the date problems. Lots of dates got imported without a timezone,
but that was not the real issue; the real issue was also that lots got
imported with &amp;ldquo;layout: post&amp;rdquo;. Take that out and it seems to fix things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Request a dump of the image cache from Typepad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement, somehow, &amp;ldquo;edit on github&amp;rdquo; so that my workflow is easier.
This might only be on the preview version. Some notes on the Hugo discussion
forums
describing how to do that are on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/how-to-implement-edit-this-page-on-github/1166&#34;&gt;How to implement “edit this page on github”?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>a great many things</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-a-great-many-things/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 22:26:21 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-a-great-many-things/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weblog, which may or may not ever see the
light of day, is about a great many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other blogs waiting to be written that
don&amp;rsquo;t have that infinite vista; they could easily
be much more narrow. What, then, do you write about?
Let&amp;rsquo;s count some of the options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker on the Raspberry Pi, following Hypriot&amp;rsquo;s lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Docker in general, and Dockerizing various things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipes, since I have a bunch already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Outage Maps, in particular try to wrangle data from OpenEI here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOIA, espeically Michigan FOIA, to follow my book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily Coffee and Wifi, the usual random walk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civic Technology, in whatever format that takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more it&amp;rsquo;s the case that the old &amp;ldquo;Vacuum&amp;rdquo; weblog is
feeling vacuous - not enough interaction with people, and not
the right platform to go deep on anything. And &amp;ldquo;Typepad&amp;rdquo; feels
really old, especially compared to everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately if I&amp;rsquo;m writing in Markdown I can mostly drop anything
I want anywhere it wants to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other great weird idea of course is to mimic the old print
notebook with all kinds of nifty sidebars, one sidebar per item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I want to have happen as a result of all of this not
inconsiderable effort? Creative control to be sure, to be able
to type something and see it appear exactly as desired on the
screen. Community engagement is another, to be part of a group
of people all working toward a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the other thing that I could do is take some old weblog,
revisit it, and republish it in some other format. Blogger&amp;rsquo;s Secret
is the reasonable one to do that to. It has virutally no traffic
now, but if I re-serialized it, it might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>the hugo cookbook</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-the-hugo-cookbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 20:55:47 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish
recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; category, and also
created a &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like
a subcategory but not really&amp;hellip;well it is as long as I am careful
about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from
mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use
of Gopher as a cookbook. It is said that an old Mac was portable
enough to be set up in the kitchen to look up recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do is set things up so that if the post is from the
recipes category, then the recipes list will show up in the sidebar
of that post, sorted alphabetically. I think I can make that work.&lt;/p&gt;
