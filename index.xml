      <description>&lt;p&gt;HBO Now is experiencing technical difficulties in hosting the premeire
of the popular Game of Thrones season, according to multiple reports
monitored on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our team is working to resolve as soon as possible. Check back
soon for updates.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HBONowHelp/status/724409299770982403&#34;&gt;@HBONowHelp, 9:26 p.m.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reddit thread has lots of suggestions, some pointing the failure
at HBO&amp;rsquo;s geolocation technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking a break from Facebook</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-24-facebook-break/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 21:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-24-facebook-break/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a temporary break from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably won&amp;rsquo;t read this message in time to switch any of your
normal communciations paths with me; indeed, unless I had told you
that I was leaving Facebook idle for a while you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d prefer it if more people were blogging, and more to the point if
I were blogging more. I miss the olden days when you could count on
people updating their blogs more than once a month and when it made
sense to make the rounds of blogrolls. But I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s just
net.nostalgia for the olden days, the same way you might say that
Flickr was better the first few years, and oh we don&amp;rsquo;t have anything
quite like the Napster that we once had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do have is Facebook, and plenty of it. A recent story somewhere
that I read somewhere (see, this media makes our brains mush) was that
people with Facebook accounts are dying, and that the Facebook we know
now will be dominated some time soon by memorials to the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with that grim promise, what to do instead? Twitter is my
solace, the endless stacatto chatter punctuated by weird Unicode
glyphs, with cryptic tendencies and self-contained non-sequiturs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break. How can you tell? I&amp;rsquo;m writing again. I don&amp;rsquo;t
write on Facebook, so much as scroll endlessly and leave little
obscure comments made out of mostly-remembered lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Roos Roast to add downtown Ann Arbor location</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-23-roos-roast-downtown/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 13:15:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-23-roos-roast-downtown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roos Roast is adding a downtown Ann Arbor location, due to open
spring of 2016. The roastery on Rosewood will expand to a
second location on E Liberty St, where Elixir Vitae used to be.
Elixir will keep its Maynard St store open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior construction in the store is going well,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to determine from looking at
the permit process and poking my head inside the door.
So far the following permits have
been pulled, according to the city&amp;rsquo;s eTrakit system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BLDG16-0317 for demolition in the existing site, approved
3/7/2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ELEC16-0449 for internal electrical wiring, approved 4/18/2016;
work by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bremray.com/&#34;&gt;Bremray Electrical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDC16-062 to the Historic District Commission for a sign,
applied 4/18/2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLUM16-0551 for plumbing, work by Chelsea Plumbing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://etrakit.a2gov.org/etrakit3/viewAttachment.aspx?Group=PERMIT&amp;amp;ActivityNo=SIGN16-0050&amp;amp;key=WMN%3a1604190852460942&#34;&gt;SIGN16-0050&lt;/a&gt;
for an aluminum sign showing a hand holding a
cup with the Roos Roast logo, applied 4/18/2016; the sign
review is due 5/5/2016. Sign by &lt;a href=&#34;http://prototypedesigninc.com/&#34;&gt;Prototype Design&lt;/a&gt; in Tecumseh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOCC16-0024 for sidewalk occupancy, issued 4/21/2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only piece of this process that looks like it could possibly go to
a public hearing is the Historic District Commission determination
of appropriateness of signage. If this were to be the case,
a large orange poster would go up in front of the store to
announce the meeting date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sign had been approved previously for the site in 2009 when the
storefront housed &amp;ldquo;Organic Bliss&amp;rdquo;; at that point there was no
requirement for anything more than staff approval of the signage.
AnnArbor.com&amp;rsquo;s story about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/organic-bliss-to-shut-down-blaming-downtown-ann-arbors-independent-retail-environment/&#34;&gt;Organic Bliss closing in 2012&lt;/a&gt; has a photo of the storefront at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously in the news, see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://roosroast.com/2016/02/deep-er-local/&#34;&gt;Deep-er Local&lt;/a&gt; on the
Roos Roast website, February 2016&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Washtenaw restaurant inspections</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-washtenaw-restaraunt-inspections/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 15:15:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-washtenaw-restaraunt-inspections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who: Wayne Eaker and the a2civictech Slack team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What: Restaurant inspections from Washtenaw County&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where: &lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&#34;&gt;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When: As they are updated, up to twice a momth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why: When you eat out, you care about food safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example searches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/?f[0]=field_count_total%3A%5B30%20TO%201000%5D&#34;&gt;Three restaurants with 30 or more violations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/?f[0]=field_inspection_violation_codes%3A6-501.111%3A%20Controlling%20Pests&amp;amp;f[1]=field_inspection_date%3A2016&#34;&gt;Reports from 2016 of pest problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of this project is that it&amp;rsquo;s dependent
on an undocumented interface from the contractor who
does the work for the county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very nice aspect of the system that Wayne put together is that
you can get alerts from every time a new inspection comes out that
matches your saved settings, so you can track a particular restaurant
or problem over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prince</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-prince/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 14:15:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-prince/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist
passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response
any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music
responded by playing his hits - &amp;ldquo;Little Red Corvette&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raspberry Beret&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;Purple Rain&amp;rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control
also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find.
Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio that I remember is from the 80s when Prince&amp;rsquo;s music was
in regular play on the Electrifyin&amp;rsquo; Mojo&amp;rsquo;s show on Detroit&amp;rsquo;s WJLB.
Prince did a very rare live radio interview with Mojo, and you can
hear it in two parts - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJZCoxZ5COY&#34;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftKtWgXzMS8&#34;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; - on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I haven&amp;rsquo;t found yet is the computer font with a perfect Prince
symbol in it. You can get close by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://parkerhiggins.net/2013/01/writing-the-prince-symbol-in-unicode/&#34;&gt;writing the prince symbol in unicode&lt;/a&gt;,
or this ASCII representation may suffice: O(+&amp;gt; . But the
real deal came on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nymag.com/following/2016/04/princes-legendary-floppy-disk-symbol-font.html&#34;&gt;3.5&amp;rdquo; floppy disc&lt;/a&gt; from Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Milnor Time at Mr. Stadium</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-milnor-time/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite laundromat is our nearby Mr. Stadium, which
features enormous 5x load Milnor washers and corresponding
supersize dryers, suitable for washing bedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milnor.com/&#34;&gt;Pellerin Milnor Corporation&lt;/a&gt; makes
the equipment, and if you need to have industrial-sized
laundry equipment, check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing laundry in a laundromat lets you experience parallel
processing first hand. It takes some minimum amount of time
to run a laundry cycle, but if you can get all of your clothing
and bedding into machines at the same time the total time to
complete can be very reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus they have one of the few original Centipede arcade games
in town, still taking quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earthquake in Ecuador, April 16, 2016</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-17-ecuador-terremoto/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2016 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-17-ecuador-terremoto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor, MI, 17 April 2016: An earthquake hit near the coast of
Ecuador on the evening of 16 April 2016. As of 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time the current estimate is 235 killed and 1,557 wounded from the
incident. Reports are still coming in from the hardest hit areas
which lost telecommunications lines in the disaster, so expect these
numbers to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports from Ecuador came in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abenavidesgol/status/721506479866572800&#34;&gt;primarily via social media&lt;/a&gt;, as it took
a while for the nation&amp;rsquo;s news organization to cut over to flash reporting
of the news from their regularly scheduled programs. The country&amp;rsquo;s
vice president, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JorgeGlas&#34;&gt;Jorge Glas&lt;/a&gt;, provided
regular and authoritative reports on damage and emergency response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the damage was almost entirely in Spanish,
as there is no substantial English language media presence in the
county. I found the automated translation service provided by Bing
in the Twitter feed to be indispensible. Some words that you will
see over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personas heridas = people injured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personas fallecidas = people killed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sin luz = without electricity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sismo, terremoto, temblor = earthquake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For music and (sometimes) news from Ecuador, I turned to Tunein, which
relays thousands of radio stations worldwide. At various times the following
channels were interesting or informative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Am%C3%A9rica-Estereo-%40Guayaquil%41-933-s68608/&#34;&gt;Radio America Estereo, Guayaquil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Quito-760-s59649/&#34;&gt;Radio Quito, 760 AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Ecuador-Inmediato-Radio-s59648/&#34;&gt;Ecuador Inmediato Radio, Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked for the shortwave broadcast of &lt;a href=&#34;http://radiohcjb.org/&#34;&gt;HCJB&lt;/a&gt; but
it would appear that its English language broadcasts are no more. There is
news in Spanish on the site under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://radiohcjb.org/author/noticias/&#34;&gt;Noticias&lt;/a&gt; banner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some individual news feeds to follow from the time of the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/lewisshepherd&#34;&gt;Lewis Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;, Washington DC based analyst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/elcomerciocom&#34;&gt;El Comercio&lt;/a&gt;, Quito newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/_MayraPacheco&#34;&gt;Mayra Pacheco&lt;/a&gt;, reporter for El Comercio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ECU911Quito&#34;&gt;ECU 911 Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/IGEcuador&#34;&gt;IG Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, Instituto Geofísico with quake maps and scientific reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts go out to everyone affected by the quake.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reluctance</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-06-reluctance/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 21:45:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-06-reluctance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason that I cannot yet pin down I have been reluctant
to blog on this site for the last few weeks. This is a slowdown
after years of continuous writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so much writers block as simple avoidance; not so much
sitting down with nothing to say, as not sitting down at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is hard work, and there&amp;rsquo;s some natural inclination to gravitate
towards writing work that is paid for to make that hard work pay. On
the other hand there is some writing that will never be renumerative,
but that wants to be written anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I am sure I will eventually give up on blogging, but I
am reluctant to say that this is that week or month. Until then, the
minimalist goal is to produce something enough that no month goes
without some measure of content or discontent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The small experiment: post the smallest amount of text to two separate
social networks, see what the differences are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I might have expected, Twitter generated fewer responses, and Facebook
generated more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that there are any conclusions to be drawn that are useful,
as neither system is necessarily &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo; for individual messages in isolation.
It&amp;rsquo;s the cumulative effect of being able to reach out to people that makes
some value of them both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrade to El Capitan</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-03-30-upgrade-to-el-capitan/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-03-30-upgrade-to-el-capitan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working through the details of an upgrade from Mavericks to
El Capitan. Some running notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood
in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster
than my home UVerse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is &lt;code&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt;. You
would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed,
and that brew is working hard to update everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason that I upgraded was to get &lt;code&gt;xhyve&lt;/code&gt; and thus
Docker for Mac. I&amp;rsquo;m using the beta now (beta 5) and have gotten
a few trivial things to work, but am still sorting out a few
questions which might or might not be issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stadium Boulevard project bids high, portions of project to be delayed</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-stadium-boulevard-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 23:15:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-02-14-stadium-boulevard-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bids for the work came in higher than expected, so the
City of Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s Ann Arbor Stadium Boulevard road
reconstruction project will likely omit the section between Main Street and Seventh.
That&amp;rsquo;s the word from the city&amp;rsquo;s engineer on the project, Michael Nearing, P.E.
He writes in an email sent from his iPhone on Saturday, Feb 13, 2016 at 1:26 PM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it appears that the only realistic option to perform the project with the funds that are available is to revise the project limits.  We are currently reviewing the plans, the planned work, our material choices, proposed construction methods, and the bid prices received to determine the most prudent course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we better understand all the factors that will affect the work, we&amp;rsquo;ll share the information with Council and the public of our revised course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hopeful the we can re-bid the project later this year and start construction after the U of M Home Football season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the city&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/departments/engineering/Pages/Stadium-Blvd-Road-Reconstruction-Project.aspx&#34;&gt;Stadium Boulevard Road Reconstruction Project&lt;/a&gt; page do not yet reflect this new reality, and the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=448974&amp;amp;GUID=C566FAA5-1AED-4525-AA34-8F5A4E2FBF6D&amp;amp;Options=info&amp;amp;Search=&#34;&gt;agenda for the February 16, 2016 Ann Arbor City Council&lt;/a&gt;
meeting also does not include an agenda item on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry&#34;&gt;chicken and onion curry&lt;/a&gt;
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431&#34;&gt;daikon raita&lt;/a&gt; from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 25 2016: The Ann Arbor Public Schools
issued this news release and letter to parents, signed by Superintendent
Jeanice Swift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, January 25, 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear AAPS Parents,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many of you may have already heard, there have been threats made on social media to multiple school districts across the metro area, extending to Florida, and rumored to have occurred as far as California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be assured that in the Ann Arbor Public Schools, we take any and all threats very seriously and consistently follow established emergency procedures in cooperation with Ann Arbor Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received information in the early morning hours that Ann Arbor was included in this social media situation.  Police were notified immediately and we have been actively working with the AAPD since first learning of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our principals were advised early this morning of this situation, and we continue to work with law enforcement officials as part of our safety protocol. We will continue to monitor this situation very closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the use of social media for posting threats against schools seems to be increasing, I would like to ask all parents to talk to their children about using social media and instruct them that if they see anything on social media that is a concern, to immediately report it to an adult, such as a parent, principal or teacher.  If they re-post or pass on the threat, they can also be held responsible for issuing a threat and can receive disciplinary action as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be assured that we take every threat seriously as safety for our students and staff is our first priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeanice K. Swift, Ph.D.
Superintendent of Schools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###
&lt;/hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing things down</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-22-writing-things-down/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2016 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-22-writing-things-down/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a series of paper notebooks that I keep meeting notes in. I&amp;rsquo;ve settled
on the Roaring Spring 100pp 5 to 1&amp;rdquo; quad ruled book, which I can get for $2.68
at the Barnes and Noble in the U of Michigan Union. The book goes with me
everywhere, and I treat it like a classic lab notebook - date and time stamp
all the pages, write things down when you possibly can, never tear a page out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that writing things down makes a huge difference in how I remember them.
The a2b3 lunch non-summary that I posted earlier today was written in a first
draft in the notebook. The practice is informed a lot by writing things into
Twitter - you don&amp;rsquo;t have much space so you have to be crisp and concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Twitter, I also get to do little sketches and drawings in the notebooks.
I miss that ability to do freehand drawings in a quad ruled environment where
it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make a shape that makes sense. My hand-drawing skills are much
better than my computer drawing skills, and that means that some part of things
I want to capture have to be written down with ink on paper first (and maybe
later or maybe never digitized).&lt;/p&gt;
