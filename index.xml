      <title>Using Github Issues and Waffle.io as a personal kanban board</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-22-github-waffle-kanban-board/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some
time now, and since November I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything
that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to
less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&amp;rsquo;s usually a lot
of duplicates; at less than 100 I&amp;rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&amp;rsquo;s
something to be done). The &amp;ldquo;Ready&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;In Progress&amp;rdquo; queues hold no more than
5 tasks apiece, since I want to keep everything in that state visible on
the screen. Finally the &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; queue reflects how much work there is that
actually got accomplished over the last week, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to say that was
hovering at about 50 tasks a week though right now it&amp;rsquo;s only at 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github issues are more than capable of handling a personal todo list - indeed
it has a lot of features that if you tried to use all of them you&amp;rsquo;d quickly
find that too much of your time was perfecting your lists and not enough
time was spent doing things. So the challenge is coming up with a simple
configuration of the system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ignore what might be done, but that
focuses on what really needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspriation for all of this is Jim Benson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Personal Kanban&amp;rdquo;, and his
observation that really the task simplifies down to two rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit work in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is merely commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Now I get to drag task 3568, &amp;ldquo;Write up use of Waffle for Vacuum blog&amp;rdquo;, into the
&amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; category, which is kinetically very satisfactory.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Haven peaches üçë, potatoes üç†, kale, green onions, tomatoes, red peppers,
and a cherry snow cone for my shopping companion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Testing to see how the emoji comes out; I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a kale emoji.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ashley and Madison, Ann Arbor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the corner of Ashley and Madison in Ann Arbor is the Washtenaw Dairy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Street is named after &amp;ldquo;Big Jim&amp;rdquo; Ashley, an Ohio congressman and
promoter and builder of what became the Ann Arbor Railroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison Street is presumably named after President James Madison, as a number
of downtown streets have presidential names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an Ashley, Michigan in Gratiot County between Owosso and Alma,
on the route of the railroad. Madison Heights, MI is just north of Royal Oak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More discussion of these pertinent facts is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/edward.vielmetti/posts/10105610388353583&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a lot of parts were replacable, and the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t
need to be replaced were returned intact with all of their data on them.
Back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to have paper notebooks and to know how to use them, and to
also have good enough backup systems that I didn&amp;rsquo;t panic. There are
a few very small things I need to learn, mostly about Github and how
to manage subprojects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be drinking coffee while I type any time soon. I wonder how that
will affect my work habits. It is perfectly OK to drink coffee and write
or draw or doodle on paper, though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor City Council Preview for 17 August 2015</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-15-a2council-preview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-15-a2council-preview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor City Council meets at 7:00 p.m. on Monday, 17 August 2015.
A preview of the agenda is on Arborwiki, complete with a map, on the
tag &lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/tags/20150817ccmtg&#34;&gt;2015-08-17CCMTG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consent agenda includes $36,412 for the purchase of 21 Taser weapons.
This is a sole-source purchase, to replace weapons purchased in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on the consent agenda is $83,000 for a sole-source purchase to
renew the CityWorks license, which is used for asset tracking and
maintenance of city owned resources. Of that amount, $20,000 will be
billed back to the Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$110,000 would go for the continuation of CLEMIS Public Safety Information
Sharing Services for the Ann Arbor Police Department for FY2016. CLEMIS
runs the dispatch system for police and allows &amp;ldquo;information sharing&amp;rdquo;
with other departments. It&amp;rsquo;s run by Oakland County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HathiTrust has digitized many decades of Ann Arbor City Council minutes,
and it it proposed that the city approve publication of those minutes through
HathiTrust by clearing the copyright on those materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public hearings include one on deer management, and there&amp;rsquo;s a proposal
on the agenda to spend $90,000 on some combination of a deer cull by
sharpshooters and sterlization of deer. Expect this to be a long public
hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In development news, there&amp;rsquo;s a proposed condominium development on N Main St
adjacent to North Main Park, and hearings on proposed annexations on Nixon
Road and on Ann Arbor - Saline Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re following the footing drain disconnect program closely, you&amp;rsquo;ll
note that there&amp;rsquo;s a proposal to lend the builder of 618 South Main
footing drain disconnect credits to allow for full occupancy of that building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More of course at the full agenda. See you on the site plan barricades
(er, see you at council).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tianjin explosion</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-14-tianjin-explosion/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 00:15:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly
removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and
social media reports. Social media users have reported that their
posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &amp;ldquo;Tianjin&amp;rdquo;
and &amp;ldquo;explosion&amp;rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo.
Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also
reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television
was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas.
Tianjin authorities banned reporters from sharing information about
the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites have been advised
to follow state media. The Tianjin Internet Police &amp;ldquo;warned
social media users to stick to official reports about the number
of dead and injured&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CNN correspondent, Will Ripley, who took photos outside TEDA
Hospital (Chinese: Ê≥∞ËææÂåªÈô¢) was interrupted in a live report by
upset friends and relatives of victims killed and injured in the
blasts.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas, I have Zeno&amp;rsquo;s Inbox, which is never emptied, only half-emptied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a2b3 lunch non-summary for the Broken Egg</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-13-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary-broken-egg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lunch at The Broken Egg with the a2b3 crew. We had 17 people show up,
which is about 2x what had been the normal attendance. The restaurant
was very accomodating, and everyone was well fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing lunch is the highlight of my week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things were discussed, here&amp;rsquo;s a few of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Perseid meteor shower peaked last night, notes Linda Diane Feldt,
who saw a few shooting stars from her cabin in Lyndon Township. I listened
to meteor scatter radio transmissions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livemeteors.com&#34;&gt;http://www.livemeteors.com&lt;/a&gt; which
listens for reflections of Toronto TV signals using a directional antenna
from Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vintage baseball is happening in Chelsea and Dexter reports Patti Smith,
and she loves the uniforms. The next game is
Vintage Base Ball: Chelsea Monitors vs. Dexter Union
August 29 @ 2:30 pm - 4:30 pm in Chelsea at Veterans Park.
The teams are the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ChelseaMonitors&#34;&gt;Chelsea Monitors&lt;/a&gt; (facebook) and
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unionbbc.com/&#34;&gt;Dexter Union&lt;/a&gt;. Dexter has a game vs Port Huron
at St. Joseph Catholic Church (Mast and N. Territorial)
on Saturday, August 15th at 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s partners meeting is an open meeting, and Tom Meloche
was there. He reported that it&amp;rsquo;s a 2.5 hour event that&amp;rsquo;s carefully
time-boxed, so that they cover everything without going over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a2b3 regular and jazz singer David Bloom is performing tonight,
Thursday August 13, 2015, at the Chelsea Clock Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stickers! My print run of stickers from VGKids in Ypsilanti is in, and I brought
stickers to lunch. Thanks to everyone who chipped in to help with
printing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>long form</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-09-long-form/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-09-long-form/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sort out how
to have more long form writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with
structure. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring
a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven
knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All watched over by machines</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-07-all-watched-over-by-machines/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 23:45:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-07-all-watched-over-by-machines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, a detailed look at the way you spend time over
the course of a day online yields several fascinating conclusions.
As previously noted, &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Wakatime&lt;/span&gt; is the introspective tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gee, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of time to look at Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you spending more of your productive time writing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll bet that if you put down the computer your day would be more productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, #2 is the most interesting one. Of course time spent on Facebook,
Twitter, and Gmail is time spent writing, but it&amp;rsquo;s transactional writing -
short bursts of functional prose to negotiate a time, set up a plan,
make a clever comeback or otherwise do online chit-chat. The words are writing,
but there&amp;rsquo;s not a body of work that you can point to that&amp;rsquo;s of any size as
your opus from that hour plus spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productive is a very funny word when you&amp;rsquo;re being watched by a machine.
Some parts of the time are marked as &amp;ldquo;good time&amp;rdquo;, where you&amp;rsquo;re happy to
have an extra minute spent credited to a project or task. Not all time is
&amp;ldquo;good time&amp;rdquo;, though some of the non-good time is just as essential, just
measured differently. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional glitch in the matrix
where time is credited or blamed on one thing but you could swear you were
doing something else at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent on task sometimes looks very small when all of these are taken into
account. Those 99 words you wrote for publication were edited down from 150,
and might be edited further down to 55. If you could precisely allocate all
of the time you spent on it it would include the musing and ruminations, but
that got chalked up to Gmail where it&amp;rsquo;s mixed in with the time spent deleting
mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to mix up inputs and outputs.
If your system measures inputs, you get ritualized behavior designed to
maximize time spent on task, no matter how the time is actually used.
Maximizing outputs would yield word counts and not minute counts. If you&amp;rsquo;re
slow and terse, there&amp;rsquo;s no help for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a2b3 lunch non-summary for August 6, 2015 at Mi Compadre</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-06-a2b3-mi-compadre-non-summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 23:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-06-a2b3-mi-compadre-non-summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;a2b3&lt;/span&gt; lunch this week was at
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Mi Compadre&lt;/span&gt;, a Mexican place on Packard.
We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was inspired this week for the lunch question by
going to the &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Workantile&lt;/span&gt; lunch on Wednesday,
which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce
yourself around the table, and answer some simple question.
At Workantile the prompt was simply &amp;ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&amp;rdquo;,
and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When lunches are well attended, it seems to be that it happens
because the news gets out in plenty of time and plenty of detail
on Facebook. Not everyone in my world does Facebook, but there&amp;rsquo;s
more people there than on Twitter or Meetup, and it appears that
Facebook might now have the tools for lunch organizing that it didn&amp;rsquo;t
have a year ago when I started using Meetup for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the help of &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Tom Meloche&lt;/span&gt; it looks like I&amp;rsquo;m going
to move the primary ritual of notifying people where the next meeting is
through a Facebook event, and move away from Meetup as the primary organizing
tool. That&amp;rsquo;s going to take a few months to pull off but it looks like
the right organizing tool for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the olden days when &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;eGroups&lt;/span&gt; was so novel that
you could build an instant community around an easy to run mailing
list. Yahoo so completely missed the boat when they turned that
into Yahoo Groups over a decade ago. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/a2b3&#34;&gt;a2b3 Yahoo group&lt;/a&gt; around indefinitely -
it&amp;rsquo;s free after all, and it&amp;rsquo;s old - but it&amp;rsquo;s not growing and
working on a system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support growth is a recipe for
stagnatation. Where I used to count on a new person every week from
Yahoo Groups I now only get 10-15 new subscribers a year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>wakatime, an automatic time tracker for programmers</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-05-wakatime/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 23:45:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-05-wakatime/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wakatime tracks your time if you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by
integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your
favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then
matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects
stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard.
&amp;ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&amp;rdquo; is the tag line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That which is measured, improves. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve
your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind. What I do
know is that manually tracking your time is a pain, and that anything
you can do to manage to keep things running in your time accounting
system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of manual labor is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that you generally don&amp;rsquo;t spend all of your
time inside a text editor. (But maybe you should! Just think how much
more productive you&amp;rsquo;d be.) Wakatime can be set up to also track you
in Chrome and pinpoint just how many hours per day get
absorbed by Twitter or Gmail or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I know myself, this is going to be a temporary enthusiasm. My
experience with the whole &amp;ldquo;quanitifed self&amp;rdquo; world is to know that
some months in the summer, my normal step count is well over 10000,
and that in the winter time it&amp;rsquo;s well under 10000, just because of
Michigan&amp;rsquo;s grey February. Benchmarking time spent sometimes makes you
work more mindfully, and sometimes just recognizes immutable human
issues that no amount of mechanical impetus will change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your new robo-assistant, Amy Ingram</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-robo-assistant-xdotai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day, computers are making people easier and easier to use.
(David Tempkin, In Formation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://x.ai?rf=8o4arg&#34;&gt;x.ai&lt;/a&gt; has a new service in development, an automated
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;personal assistant&lt;/span&gt;
that helps you schedule meetings. You give it - or I should
say &amp;ldquo;her&amp;rdquo;, because the bot&amp;rsquo;s name is &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Amy Ingram&lt;/span&gt; -
you give Amy your calendar and some simple instructions, and &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo;
manages the correspondence with the person you&amp;rsquo;re trying to meet
with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is very new, so new that it&amp;rsquo;s the subject of breathless
enthusiasm about how wonderful it works in media accounts. Suddenly
people who never have had a personal assistant work for them get
access to an automaton who behaves like a well trained and inhumanly
efficient personal scheduler, and they get excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what is a personal assistant anyway but a carefully programmed
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;protocol droid&lt;/span&gt;,
something who knows the expressions that are used
to work your way onto someone&amp;rsquo;s calendar. Having been trained with
the likes of Siri, we collectively know how useful it is to have a bot
teach us how to ask questions in an easy to parse, formalized way.
x.ai&amp;rsquo;s Amy invokes all of our ritual behavior when it comes to understanding
how to deal with the gatekeepers to the powerful and busy, and wraps
that up in an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up to be on the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some press coverage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get a response from Mindy, Tim, or Amy, I have no idea if
it was a human or machine that sent the message on their behalf.
With an assistants-as-app, the distinction between who&amp;rsquo;s doing the
messaging isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear ‚Äî sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a bot and sometimes
it‚Äôs not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WNYC, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wnyc.org/story/latest-productivity-digital-personal-assistant-named-amy/&#34;&gt;Say Hello to Amy, Your Plucky Digital Personal Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. November 26, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode, we test out a new breed of personal assistant.
Her, or its, name is Amy Ingram. She&amp;rsquo;s plucky, tenacious, and loves
arranging meetings. In contrast to Apple&amp;rsquo;s Siri, Google Now or
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Cortana, Amy is specialized on one thing and one thing
only: scheduling. A new and increasingly common type of software,
Amy isn&amp;rsquo;t a program you download, or an app you install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyingramnyc&#34;&gt;Amy Ingram&lt;/a&gt;, LinkedIn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful Meeting Scheduling Personal Assistant with excellent
communication and follow-through skills. Demonstrates exceptional
interpersonal skills and high level of confidentiality. Extremely
well-organized, methodical and efficient. Ability to multi-task and
work well in an always changing, fast-paced environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business Insider, Lara O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/review-of-amy-ingram-the-virtual-personal-assistant-from-xai-2015-7&#34;&gt;I hired a virtual PA for a week and it&amp;rsquo;s made me a far more organized person than I ever was before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there on in, organizing meetings became a breeze. Those who
didn&amp;rsquo;t know me too well didn&amp;rsquo;t question the fact that I was adding
Amy into our conversations. Those who did were just as incredulous
as Chris. One contact responded: &amp;ldquo;Well if I‚Äôd known you had people
I would have got my people to speak to your people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>I voted, summer 2015 edition</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan
to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and
Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup
of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when
voter turnout is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating
victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining
funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on,
or the perpetually politically curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of picking up result tapes from Ward Four precincts, I ended up
at Arbor Brewing Company which was Council Party HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Sabra Briere&lt;/span&gt; over Will Leaf, handily with 70%+ of the vote,
though only 6% of registered voters actually voted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Ward: We&amp;rsquo;ll wait until the fall for this as Jane Lumm (I) meets
Sally Hart Petersen (D) in November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Zachary Ackerman&lt;/span&gt; defeats Steve Kunselman by about 40 votes.
This was the surprise of the night. Ackerman&amp;rsquo;s entire margin of victory was
his strong showing in 3-3 (Burns Park) where he outpaced Kunselman 345-171.
Turnout was under 11%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Jack Eaton&lt;/span&gt; defeats Jamie Magiera with about 60% of the vote.
Jack held his party at Wolverine Brewing; Jamie was at ABC, looking subdued.
Turnout was about 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifth Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Chip Smith&lt;/span&gt; defeated Mike Anglin with about 55% of the vote.
Voter turnout in the mighty Fifth Ward was strong compared to the other wards,
with a mighty 14% of the electorate turning out to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 85%+ of Ann Arbor voters who didn&amp;rsquo;t know enough or didn&amp;rsquo;t bother
to turn out to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>expertise encapsulated into out of date memory banks</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 22:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-03-expertise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the case of experts &amp;ldquo;writing down what they know&amp;rdquo;, and
incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down
everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&amp;rsquo;s
no internal inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world usually works in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s changing fast enough
that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is
always holding as &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; in that memory bank something that is
demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under
them. Even if you have an iron-clad commitment to keeping the
memory bank narrowly scoped and revisiting every element of it to
refresh it periodically, the nature of written memory is to grow more and more
out of date or to consume more and more resources to keep fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map is not the territory - and even if by some miracle the map
at one time was perfectly matched with the world - the world changes
fast enough that we can&amp;rsquo;t know any more than a small part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the impossible task of keeping a Localwiki fresh in
the face of reflecting changes in a city, by Brian Eno&amp;rsquo;s quote
&amp;ldquo;Forgetting is as important as remembering&amp;rdquo;, and by
Jerry Michalski&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Brain&amp;rdquo; magnum opus. Of course I forget where I
read the Eno quote, and a search for it turns up William James saying
the same thing in 1892, but Eno is easier to remember as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
