      <title>WKAR-TV television spectrum may be up for sale, and the station is at risk</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-06-wkar-television-spectrum-sale/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-06-wkar-television-spectrum-sale/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michigan State University is considering placing the spectrum
that it uses for WKAR-TV into an auction that the FCC is running,
in which case it might receive upwards of $200 million in exchange
for ceasing all of its terrestrial broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as a penny wise, pound foolish approach. Once
the spectrum is gone you can&amp;rsquo;t get it back, and as a land grant
institution should know it&amp;rsquo;s important to be a good steward of
the resources you have been handed not just for the short term
but for the long term. Selling off a 50+ year tradition of
public broadcasting for a quick buck seems like a bad approach,
no matter how appealing a big check would be, especially
considering the community&amp;rsquo;s investment in the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have a TV receiver for over the air broadcasts,
but my neighbor down the street who does make the trek from Ann
Arbor to Lansing to give her thoughts. Her family grew up on WKAR-TV
and have been supporters for years, and they rely on over the
air television to bring in the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More as I have it; I&amp;rsquo;m collecting links and news articles at
the Lansing Localwiki, at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/lansing/WKAR-TV&#34;&gt;WKAR-TV&lt;/a&gt;
page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Morse Code</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-02-learning-morse-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 00:01:02 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-02-learning-morse-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn Morse Code, at least to be able to copy characters at a
a fast enough pace to understand what the IDs on the local 2 meter
amateur repeaters are saying. Over a previous holiday break I had
sorted out at least a little bit of sending Morse, so some letters
are already familiar (CQ, K, E, SOS). I don&amp;rsquo;t yet know how to either
send or recognize my call sign. There&amp;rsquo;s a ways to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ward Cunningham K9OX has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://c2.com/~ward/morse/&#34;&gt;page full of ham radio software&lt;/a&gt;, including a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://c2.com/~ward/morse/morse.html&#34;&gt;Morse Code Teaching Machine&lt;/a&gt;
that does a nifty adaptive learning system to feed you the letters
you need work on. It dates from the article
&lt;a href=&#34;http://c2.com/morse/wiki.cgi?QstArticle&#34;&gt;A Fully Automatic Morse Code Teaching Machine, QST (May 1977)&lt;/a&gt;.
Ward wrote it to fit on a very tiny machine, and it&amp;rsquo;s been subsequently
ported and improved to run on bigger machines, but still at its heart
it&amp;rsquo;s old and tiny (and in some essential way very wonderful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using the Macintosh version; there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting
version for Ward&amp;rsquo;s federated wiki as well, which would
be worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>QSL card template for Lob.com</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-01-qsl-card-template/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 16:33:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-01-qsl-card-template/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As previously noted here I&amp;rsquo;m fond of getting and sending postcards.
I&amp;rsquo;m also a ham radio operator, which makes it reasonable to want
to get and send postcards as QSL cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a stockpile of preprinted cards, so my habit is to
recycle old postcards either from PTO Thrift ($0.10 each) or from
a local bookseller ($0.00 each), apply a postcard stamp, and hand
write the details. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also successfully send cards using
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lob.com&#34;&gt;lob.com service&lt;/a&gt; and the thought is that
if I got my act together I could pretty easily put together a
QSL printer that would run off a command line and lob full-custom cards
into the mail at about $0.70 each postage paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have a QSL card template for lob.com. Some notes for
starting such a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lob.com/blog/print-mail-custom-postcards-using-html-css-ruby-on-rails&#34;&gt;Print and Mail Custom Postcards using HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lob.com/blog/free-4x6-postcard-templates/&#34;&gt;Free 4x6 Postcard Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of &amp;ldquo;QSL template&amp;rdquo; pages on the net, but most
of them start from Microsoft Word, and I&amp;rsquo;m after an HTML
QSL template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;No results found for &amp;quot;html qsl template&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of SQL, not much QSL. Will keep looking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I turned 99 cents worth of kale into half a gallon of delicious ice cream</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-22-kale-into-ice-cream/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-22-kale-into-ice-cream/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn this one weird trick&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&amp;rsquo;s had a sale on kale for
99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and
when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it
from the wrong bin, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get home, cook the kale (it&amp;rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the
twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&amp;rsquo;t
actually organic, and that I was overcharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been through the &amp;ldquo;Lucky&amp;rsquo;s overcharges&amp;rdquo; before on our neighborhood
email list, where it comes up from time to time., I didn&amp;rsquo;t
have to quote chapter and verse of state law, just mention the
Michigan scan law. The manager hand wrote a receipt and gave me
$5.00 cash as well as refunding the purchase price of the kale on
my card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any more kale. Chocolate ice cream
was $4.99 per half gallon, and it too was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your receipts, at least until the meal is eaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the twist-ties on your produce to make sure you got what you were charged for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic produce PLU numbers are 5 digits starting with a 9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucky&amp;rsquo;s was friendly when I pointed out their error, no hassle at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sauteed kale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bunch kale (organic preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 clove garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat the oil until it shimmers. Slice the garlic into slices and
cook until fragrant but not yet browned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wash the kale and trim the stems . Chop the leaves finely. Add to
hot pan and stir until the kale has wilted somewhat and has changed
color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cup of water to the pan, then cover quickly. Steam
the kale until cooked to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A visit to the Computer and Video Game Archive, @umcvga</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-18-a-visit-to-um-cvga/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-18-a-visit-to-um-cvga/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/&#34;&gt;University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) Fifth Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to spend some time at the U of Michigan
&lt;a href=&#34;http://guides.lib.umich.edu/cvga&#34;&gt;Computer and Video Game Archive&lt;/a&gt;
tonight, with J in tow (or perhaps I was in tow).
We played for about two hours in total, and then adjourned
for dinner to talk about new and classic gaming and game emulation.
He snuck in a few games of Tetris on his phone afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few game reviews and observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first game I turn to at the UMCVGA is an arcade version of
Centipede. The archive has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arcadelegends.com/&#34;&gt;Arcade Legends&lt;/a&gt;
cabinet that has real arcade controls, and then emulated games
running on some kind of Linux system running MAME inside.
&amp;ldquo;Legendary arcade games authentic in every detail&amp;rdquo; says the pitch,
and the game comes with the crucial trackball that makes the
arcade version of Centipede a singular experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Atari game, Centipede is also available on other systems, and
I looked at it on the Atari 2600, running on original hardware
including a vintage analog television set for the display. Centipede
is not very complex, and the 2600 version is faithful to the original
gameplay for the most part. The graphics are as flickery as I had
ever remembered, especially when you hit your target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reasonable life goal is to play Centipede on as many systems as
the Archive supports. The Mirlyn catalog currently suggests
that there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?type%5B%5D=all&amp;amp;lookfor%5B%5D=centipede%20game&amp;amp;filter%5B%5D=format%3AVideo%20Games&#34;&gt;eight versions of Centipede&lt;/a&gt; available, on platforms including
Sega Dreamcast,
the TI-99,
Atari 2600,
Sega Genesis,
Playstation Portable (PSP),
Windows 95 / 98,
Playstation, and
Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal Crossing on the Nintendo 3DS was new to me, though I had
heard &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/chairckicker&#34;&gt;Brian Kerr&lt;/a&gt; talk about it
for quite some time. Animal Crossing is really fun in a quirky little
way that a social casual game that&amp;rsquo;s age-appropriate for seven year
olds can be. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far into the game, but it was clear
that every character in the game that interacted with me was super
happy to see me back in the system, and that kind of welcoming
reunion greeting was something I want to emulate myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent (January 2015) interview with David Carter (superman) on PRX
was a good 17 minute listen about the current state of the archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On PRX: &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.prx.org/stories/141395&#34;&gt;Six Years Inside the Computer &amp;amp; Video Game Archive with David Carter&lt;/a&gt; from Radio Free Culture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Carter of the Computer &amp;amp; Video Game Archive at University of
Michigan tells us about the collection, how it&amp;rsquo;s used in an academic
setting, and a little about the care and feeding of elderly video
game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a next visit already scheduled for January.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Platforms for the Internet of Things, 2015 edition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question
of &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer
IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes
in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt,
it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for
2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar
systems are next to each other. It&amp;rsquo;s a highly dimensional space, but
all elements have something in common: engineers are trying to
change how we interact with simple devices like light bulbs through
our hand-held phones, and no one has the full correct answer that&amp;rsquo;s
obviously right. Indeed it&amp;rsquo;s not clear at all that there is
a right answer for some of these controls; the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/internetofshit&#34;&gt;Internet of Shit twitter account&lt;/a&gt;
collects with some glee the number of devices that emphatically should
not be on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt; is hard to ignore. Many smaller cloud platforms are
built on top of its AWS computing platforms, and Amazon has
entered the fray with its AWS IoT service that offers a hosted
MQTT message server. In addition Amazon has the Echo product
that does voice recognition. Nearly impossible to ignore, Amazon
is a clear central player in the IoT consumer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; is a distant second in the IoT world, mostly because
the Google Compute Engine isn&amp;rsquo;t the first choice for a compute
platform, and the Android phone isn&amp;rsquo;t the first choice for a top
end phone. Google does have the moxie to make it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Internet Thing&amp;rdquo;
be a self-driving car. The Nest thermostat is the most obvious
home point-of-entry for Google, and the platform and brand extension
to watch is more stuff that works with Nest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt; has the phone to want, and the assistant (Siri) that people
have learned how to talk to to get things done. If the Internet of
Things is going to be controlled from an app, it&amp;rsquo;s an app that&amp;rsquo;s going
to run on an Apple phone, and you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to talk to it.
Less clear is Apple&amp;rsquo;s in-home device hub strategy - the AppleTV never
really has had that open platform feel to attract the first-mover developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; would dearly love to play in this world, but Windows 10
on ARM and the Raspberry Pi is a disappointment, and &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; is mostly
defined by problems too big for Excel. The Microsoft cloud platform,
Azure, mostly seems to be used by organizations that treat it as
a second or third data center, or who are locked in to Azure for
business and partnership reasons. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Cortana is capable, but
hardly anyone has Windows phones to talk with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IBM&lt;/em&gt; is the wild card here. Their Bluemix hosted platform service is
interesting if unusual and not really aimed at the consumer space. A
very interesting Node-RED project has extended IBM influence into
the Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth BLE sensor space, but it feels like
an interesting technology play and not a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, to major players with hardware. &amp;ldquo;How many engineers does it
take to change a lightbulb?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philips&lt;/em&gt; has the Hue line of home products, mostly lighting focused.
There was a hue and cry about the Philips decision to disable support
for some compatible products that did not have explicit partnership
agreements in place, and the nature of the complaining made it clear
that there&amp;rsquo;s an active hobbyist community around this product space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flex&lt;/em&gt; is the new player, with its recent acquisition of the
assets of Wink from the bankruptcy of Quirky.  Flex, formerly known
as Flextronics, is a large contract manufacturer, and it knows how
to build quite a few things; look for Wink&amp;rsquo;s technology to make its
way into a wider range of products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; and their SmartThings brand has enough market share to make
interesting efforts, but again to that point there&amp;rsquo;s no one breakout
product in their portfolio that brings that brand much to mind unless
you are using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest winner in the IoT space for this year and probably for
next year is an Internet tool with the unlikely name of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ifttt.com&#34;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;ldquo;If this, then that&amp;rdquo; is the level of control you get with IFTTT,
and surprisingly enough that&amp;rsquo;s enough to do all sorts of things -
mostly because IFTTT speaks just enough of the protocols of over 100
systems that you can glue together a recipe that does something
when something else happens even when the two vendors you are dealing
with have never heard of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability is the bugaboo of Internet of Things systems development.
Many vendors want you to sign up to their big bear hug of a partnership
agreement and work solely within their ecosystem. Others have narrow
APIs and proprietary protocols that discourage casual reuse. Where
IFTTT fits in is as a universal connector kit that lets you explore
how parts fit together.  The IFTTT
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ifttt.com/recipes/collections/32-recipes-for-the-internet-of-things&#34;&gt;recipes for the Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt; captures some of the essence of what
can be done right now without much of a fuss if you have wide protocol
support, even if it&amp;rsquo;s only very simple support.
Many vendors in the &amp;ldquo;Internet of Things&amp;rdquo;
space could benefit from thorough understanding of simple connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OpenVPN scaling</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-16-openvpn-scaling/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2015 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-16-openvpn-scaling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-11-20-openvpn-in-a-container/&#34;&gt;OpenVPN in a container&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also previously: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/&#34;&gt;Split tunnels considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this running in a staging environment and a test
environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying
operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing
rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that
it runs on a single host &amp;amp; thus provides neither
high availability in the case of Amazon &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-20-aws-dynamodb-downtime-sunday-am/&#34;&gt;funkiness&lt;/a&gt;
nor scalability to handle lots of clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting this to be more reliable was a matter of tracking
down the right systemd configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ll save systemd
commentary for a separate post, saying only that it&amp;rsquo;s new,
it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily better for managing single machines,
but I can see the advantages for consolidated management of
big collections of machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some OpenVPN config alternatives to pursue that look like they might do
the right thing are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cloudcoreo.com&#34;&gt;CloudCoreo&lt;/a&gt; has a setup based on the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.
They say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting an OpenVPN config up and running in AWS is difficult. We&amp;rsquo;ve already done it for you in an HA, durable, self-healing way. This blog post details how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog post is in two sections.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn/&#34;&gt;Part one&lt;/a&gt; details how they
configured autoscaling, elastic load balancing, name service, S3
storage and policies, and security and IAM policies to set things
up the way that you would want them within Amazon&amp;rsquo;s AWS.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn-part-2-of-2/&#34;&gt;Part two&lt;/a&gt; goes on to describe the particular OpenVPN policy
and routing setup, and there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of policy there particularly
with the use of split tunnels that you want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their claim that they have
&amp;ldquo;done it all for you&amp;rdquo; reflects a &lt;a href=&#34;http://hub.cloudcoreo.com/stack/servers-vpn_c6a65&#34;&gt;complete configuration&lt;/a&gt; available
through their CloudCoreo system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach is detailed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.zalando.com&#34;&gt;Zalando&lt;/a&gt;, a Berlin based retail fashion platform.
Their article &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.zalando.com/blog/building-an-openvpn-cluster-zalando-style/&#34;&gt;Building an OpenVPN Cluster, Zalando-Style&lt;/a&gt;
uses dynamic routing to distribute routes, and the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/&#34;&gt;Quagga&lt;/a&gt; system as their software based router. This setup
does not particularly depend on AWS features, and they
claim that
&amp;ldquo;With this set up, we have about 800 users (150 in parallel) and haven’t faced any performance issues at anytime, from anywhere!&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more complex to set up, though the writeup
makes it clear that because of the flexibility that dynamic
routing gives you there&amp;rsquo;s the opportunity to construct
firewall policies that follow the user quite independent
of how they are connecting to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. (John Gall, Systemantics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>I am eating a sandwich, with a recipe in Github</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 23:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-14-i-am-eating-a-sandwich-github-recipes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich.
That&amp;rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies,
even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative
of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need
only point you at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/main.html&#34;&gt;Usenet Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;,
developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.
&amp;ldquo;I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I would have feared.&amp;rdquo; But that collection is
weak on sandwiches, lending itself more to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/us/SP-menu.html&#34;&gt;soups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this need I have started a small and pitiful but
hopefully growable sandwich recipe collection, using Github
as the hosting place of choice. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich&#34;&gt;the vielmetti/sandwich repository&lt;/a&gt;
for the first start. As it happens, I am clearly not the only person
to think this way; herewith some collection of sandwich collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrie Turner (@bazbt3) came up with roughly the same idea at the same
time, and you might see his &lt;a href=&#34;http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2015/12/10/git-sandwiches/&#34;&gt;git sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; blog for the proper inspiration for collection
development. Thanks to @ellemef for connecting us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single sandwiches in git include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/magnus919/grilledcheese&#34;&gt;grilled cheese&lt;/a&gt;, from Magnus Hedemark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcon/recipes/tree/master/meals/fried_chicken_sandwich&#34;&gt;gluten free fried chicken sandwich&lt;/a&gt; from Patrick Connelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and certainly many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are ill-equipped in your kitchen
to make your own sandwiches, this command line tool will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js&#34;&gt;order you a sandwich from Jimmy John&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with a makefile so that you invoke it as
&lt;code&gt;sudo make me a sandwich&lt;/code&gt; and it will do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes, 2015 edition</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2015 14:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-10-thanks-for-birthday-wishes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings
is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing
&amp;ldquo;happy birthday&amp;rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and
paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile.
The topic of the conversation was roughly &amp;ldquo;places to take a walk
outside in the winter&amp;rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include
&amp;ldquo;with a dog&amp;rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get
onto Arborwiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always the Arborwiki &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals&#34;&gt;birthday deals&lt;/a&gt;
page came through, and I scored freebies or discounts at
Northside Grill (breakfast sandwich), Roos Roast (mocha),
Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Bakery (bread) and Zingerman&amp;rsquo;s Coffee (coffee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical commentary of the year is that Twitter has an
opportunity to step up its birthday game, and it would seem
that that&amp;rsquo;s a chance to do things right (or do things differently
from Facebook, at least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the next time around the sun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Requesting meeting minutes under the Open Meetings Act</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-08-open-meetings-act-minutes-request/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 22:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-08-open-meetings-act-minutes-request/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes
through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor
routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve
had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the
Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recent request
that gave me same-day results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello, this is a request under the Michigan Open Meetings Act.

Please make available for inspection the draft minutes of the (named)
Committee meeting of today, December 8, 2015.

Under the terms of the Act, draft minutes are to be made available
for inspection within 8 business days of the date of the meeting,
or by my calendar December 18, 2015.

(Name) is listed as the staff contact for this board.

Thank you for your cooperation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request was routed to the staff member, and the minutes were prepared
and ready and shared with me the same day that the meeting was held.
Same day service!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kodi, formerly XMBC</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-07-kodi-formerly-xmbc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 06:45:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-07-kodi-formerly-xmbc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kodi.tv&#34;&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt; as a possible software
core for home media player for the living room. We have a whole
rack of CDs and a shelf of LPs from our music-buying days, and I
miss being able to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi is the software formerly known as XMBC, and XMBC is still
the name of the foundation that supports the work. It runs on
most systems, and there are several distributions of it specifically
for systems like the Raspberry Pi. in particular the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.openelec.tv/index.php/OpenELEC_FAQ&#34;&gt;OpenELEC&lt;/a&gt;
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a review or a how to, just some notes so that when
I come back to the task I will have a better running start at it.&lt;/p&gt;
