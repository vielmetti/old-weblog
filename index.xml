      <description>Edward Vielmetti has been writing the Vacuum weblog since 1999 from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The topics vary widely, with over 2000 entries in the whole collection. As much as possible, the first page has the current focus, but if you dig deep enough you&amp;rsquo;ll find lots of things that were interesting once and may be interesting again.
The current set of systems that are an area of focus - and the places I draw from for inspiration on each - are as follows.</description>

      <title>Upgrade to Hugo 0.20</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded this weblog to Hugo 0.20, which is available by Homebrew on the Mac and with a series of prebuilt binaries for many systems.
Hugo in this 0.20 new release promises a lot of new features, including but not limited to support for rendering calendars. I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a try.
One of my goals of Hugo is getting it to run on linux/arm64. It should be easy, since it&amp;rsquo;s written in Go, and golang ports are absurdly easy.</description>

      <title>Learning Terraform</title>

      <description>Terraform is a provisioning tool from Hashicorp. It manages the process of setting up and tearing down and updating your computing infrastructure. Commands necessary to set up your machines are stored in files, with just enough language features in that configuration description language to accomplish simple automation efforts and to keep secrets out of common config files.
Terraform lives in the same computational universe as other packages like Vagrant, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Salt.</description>

      <description>This seems to be the state of the software development world, where you really only have two states of affairs:
State one is really old, stable, standardized, &amp;ldquo;legacy&amp;rdquo; code, well documented, portable, runs everywhere, easy to port to new systems and architectures. The &amp;ldquo;curl&amp;rdquo; library is probably the archetype of this, written in C.
State two is really new, unstable, exciting, &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; code, always changing, designed largely for a 64-bit Intel architecture, and unpredictably hard or easy to port to new systems and architectures.</description>

      <title>Oblique strategies as a service</title>

      <description>In 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt collaborated on a card deck of strategies for overcoming creative blocks. This was produced in limited and somewhat varying editions, and when it escaped into the computing world at slightly later date, various electronic versions were produced (including one in FORTRAN). Prentiss Riddle noted some of this history in 2004.
The &amp;lsquo;oblique&amp;rsquo; code is simple; a file with strategies, one per line, and a function to return a random line from that file.</description>

      <description>A well-managed software project will inevitably have issues come up that need discussion and resolution. These might be out-and-out bugs, but more often than not they are also difficulties that people have getting started running something complex, or issues that arise when building for an environment that is not the same as what the developers have experienced.
The best projects I&amp;rsquo;ve seen have used the ability for Github to provide a template for the issue report.</description>

      <title>DTE power outage is worst in company history due to high winds</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w10-4-dte-power-outage/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w10-4-dte-power-outage/</guid>
      <description>High winds hit southeastern Michigan on Wednesday, March 8 2017. As a result, many DTE customers lost power. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but DTE&amp;rsquo;s estimate is that about 800,000 customers were affected, making this the worst storm in company history.
Even before the peak of the storm, the DTE infrastructure for notifying customers of outage status and gathering incident information from its customers failed. DTE&amp;rsquo;s web site was down for the better part of Wednesdsay, and when it came back up it only had the bare minimum of information, with no outage restoration times available and no public-facing map detail of outages.</description>

      <title>February 28, 2017 AWS S3 downtime</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w09-3-aws-s3-downtime/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w09-3-aws-s3-downtime/</guid>
      <description>Amazon Web Services had downtime yesterday. Their S3 storage service had what was described as elevated error rates in the US-East zone, and as a result failures started in other AWS services in US-East that depended on S3.
The failures were reminiscent of the DynamoDB downtime of September 20, 2015, in that seemingly unrelated services share a common failure mode because of unforeseen interdependencies.
 A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.</description>

      <title>Dogfooding</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-4-dogfooding/</guid>
      <description>To &amp;ldquo;dogfood&amp;rdquo; comes from the phrase &amp;ldquo;to eat your own dogfood&amp;rdquo;, giving the sense that you are not only producing a product but also consuming it as well. This is intended to show that you care so much about your customers success in using that product that you are willing to use it the way they are intended to use it.
&amp;ldquo;Dogfooding&amp;rdquo; is thus shorthand for actually depending on something that you make yourself for sale.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time I had a daily deadline to write 500 words. Anything was fair game as long as it was spelled correctly and included the two words &amp;ldquo;Ann Arbor&amp;rdquo; prominently in the lead paragraph. Those days are gone, but the memory of them reminds me of just how much hard work it is to have something new to say every day that&amp;rsquo;s worthy of publication.
There&amp;rsquo;s a certain rhythm to writing every day.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped for the most part watching and caring about how many people view the various bits of writing I do.
The analytical tools out there for measuring the net have their primary impetus the selling of advertising, and as such they have slowly but surely morphed to be less and less useful for the discovery of non-commerical intent.
It used to be that Google Analytics would tell you the exact search terms that someone used to get to your page.</description>

      <title>That new system smell</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-1-that-new-system-smell/</guid>
      <description>That new system smell is what you smell when there&amp;rsquo;s a brand new blank page and you have a ready approach to fill it up. It&amp;rsquo;s the well-worked out technique just waiting for some new set of tasks to tackle.
Some times new systems present as &amp;ldquo;greenfield&amp;rdquo; opportunities, with brand-new things to do that don&amp;rsquo;t require much in the way of adherence to what&amp;rsquo;s gone on in the past. Others show up as &amp;ldquo;brownfields&amp;rdquo;, with their fair share of underground surprises and an acrid or pungent smell of previous toxins or old tailings.</description>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2017/2017-w08-1-small-wins/</guid>
      <description>I am reminded again of Karl Weick&amp;rsquo;s work on &amp;ldquo;small wins&amp;rdquo;, the observation that large problems are so large that we are overwhelmed just in thinking about them. It can be incredibly powerful to have a series of small wins that provide some momentum and that set you up for increasing confidence and capability to tackle bigger issues.
My small win of the moment is getting this blog post up, reminding myself that once upon a time I met a writing deadline every day for publication, and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for every single post to be a big thing.</description>

      <description>Warning: objects in calendar are closer than they appear.
I can never keep track of the day of the month, it seems. The watch on my wrist has a day marker, but it wants to have a 31 day month, and when we have 30 or 28 day months the day has to be manually adjusted. On the other hand, I have a keen sense for what day of the week it is.</description>

As always, when there&amp;rsquo;s a leap second, people get a chance to debug their timekeeping code. I guess if they happen frequently enough the code will get better exercise and some bugs will be shaken out.</description>

The question to be answered is how to manage Docker containers - not just how to get them running, but also how to poke inside them while they are running to see what they are doing and make sure that you can make sense of what is happening while you develop or run in production.</description>

      <description>The Tectonic Summit was a conference in New York City in December 2016, hosted by CoreOS, with the theme Enterprise Kubernetes. Mohan Kartha and Edward Vielmetti went there as a guest of Packet, a bare-metal hosting provider in the city. This report details highlights of the presentations at the event as well as accounts from attendees of what they thought was missing from the presentation and discussions.
Kubernetes Kubernetes is an orchestration system that runs on top of a container system like Docker.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m testing out using Opera instead of Chrome as my browser of choice, as recommended by Ernie Smith. So far so good. He notes that Opera is &amp;ldquo;basically Chrome (same engine) minus the battery drain&amp;rdquo;. My experience to date bears that out, though it&amp;rsquo;s in the early stages yet.
The first thing I noticed is that memory usage for Opera is way less than for Chrome. That&amp;rsquo;s a big deal for me because I&amp;rsquo;m often noticing that this MacBook Air is in the red zone for memory with Chrome.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Derp Learning&amp;rdquo; is a categorization of the mistakes that &amp;ldquo;deep learning&amp;rdquo; techniques in artificial intelligence tend to make. It&amp;rsquo;s a typo, but also a deep insight into how complex systems fail.
Some examples to illustrate:
Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for Unrecognizable Images, 2014. Nguyen describes &amp;ldquo;fooling images&amp;rdquo; that deep neural networks misclassify after being trained with a training set. These images are straightforward to construct and will fool the network with high confidence.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re developing in Docker, and you have a container with a lot of layers when you&amp;rsquo;re done. How do you make sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t have security vulnerabilities hiding somewhere inside there, especially if you are running a container that depends on something that depends on something that depends on something else?
The first step is to understand your own application, so that you can have some sense for how the dependencies that you have control over are impacted.</description>

      <description>The Cubs won the pennant, and the Buckeyes lost to Penn State. I was able to listen to the radio calls of both of these through recievers connected to sdr.hu.
The Cubs radio call was from WMVP-AM, ESPN Chicago 1000. I had some practice listening to them through the Farmington Hills, MI SDR run by KB8SPI. That system is a KiwiSDR with a PA0RDT Mini-Whip, and it tunes from 0-30 Mhz including all of the longwave (broadcast AM) band.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I spent some time with a 96 core ARMv8 server. On day two I figured out a couple more things about that server.
First and foremost, the extended path of installing Docker on the server I chronicled yesterday ended up being much easier today. A simple
apt-get install docker.io  did the right thing to bring Docker 1.12.1 into the system. Don&amp;rsquo;t do
apt-get install docker  on Ubuntu; you&amp;rsquo;ll get &amp;ldquo;docker - System tray for KDE3/GNOME2 docklet applications&amp;rdquo; instead.</description>

      <description>I had early access to a 96 core, 128 gigabyte ARMv8 server today. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did to get all of the CPUs and all of the memory in use at the same time.
The system: a bare-metal hosting company is working on general availability of these ARMv8 (aarch64) servers. I got early access for beta testing. Talk to me if you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more.
The software: These systems boot with Ubuntu 16.</description>

      <description>Chalice is a microframework for Python for AWS Lambda, similar in spirit to Flask. What does that even mean?
A framework is a set of libraries and coding conventions that makes development in a specific language for a specific task easier. That usually involves making some simplifying assumptions about the task you are trying to solve, and embedding those assumptions in your code so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to spell out quite as much detail to get a task done.</description>

      <description>Duong Dinh Cuong (on Github as cuongquay) has contributed a node for Node-RED that encapsulates the AWS IoT service and allows straightforward communication between the two systems over MQTT.
The node, node-red-contrib-aws-iot-hub, includes support for the message-passing part of AWS IoT using MQTT, allowing you to open a channel to the IoT service and publish or subscribe to message topics. The result is easy integration between the two systems. As a part of this process, the node includes support for AWS certificates that have to be installed &amp;ldquo;just so&amp;rdquo; to allow AWS to trust Node-RED.</description>

      <description>In the process of looking at embedded radio components, I came across the u-blox SARA-N2, a low power device designed to provide low bandwidth cellular data coverage for Internet of Things devices - &amp;ldquo;low power consumption and extended coverage&amp;rdquo; being the operative buzzwords. Speeds are 227 Kbps down and 21 Kbps up, and it&amp;rsquo;s claimed to be &amp;ldquo;low power&amp;rdquo; though no specific power consumption figures are provided.
It&amp;rsquo;s built on NB-IoT standards that are standardized in June 2016 by the 3GPP project and which are codified in their Release 13.</description>

      <description>sdr.hu is the home base for OpenWebRX, a remote spectrum monitoring system written by Andras HA7ILM.
The system is designed to allow OpenWebRX servers, running on RTL-SDR or HackRF hardware, to share their radio spectrum and allow remote tuning of the available radio bandwidth. A typical installation will allow up to four remote listeners to independently tune in, and the tuning filters allow the listener to independently control the bandwidth of the receiver.</description>

      <description>The writing prompt is simple scaffolding: write 500 words about what you&amp;rsquo;re working on right now, so that when someone asks what you do, you have a proof point of it. This is preparation for going to a conference where proof of professional identity is the whole point of the exercise. The thing you say you&amp;rsquo;re working on should be elaborated on at the top of the page, and any supporting details that don&amp;rsquo;t fit into the narrative should be omitted.</description>

      <description>Coffee and wifi (double espresso over ice) at the &amp;ldquo;dog park Biggby&amp;rdquo;, Platt Road at Ellsworth. It&amp;rsquo;s not an inconvenient location, and the very large south-facing windows are good to know about as the days get shorter.
More than 90 degrees outside, and I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to make dinner. The recipe is for &amp;ldquo;broccoli Calabrian style&amp;rdquo; from Martha Rose Shulman. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find that exact recipe online, but this Bucatini Con Broccoli Alla Calabrese is close.</description>

      <description>A magnitude 5.6 earthquake rattled oil country in Oklahoma on September 3, 2016 at 7:02 a.m. The quake&amp;rsquo;s epicenter was eight miles northwest of Pawnee, OK. The USGS maps of the quake are detailed.
The Pawnee Nation declared a state of emergency after ordering evacuations of damaged buildings in the area.
Historically, the incidence of earthquakes in Oklahoma is low, and there is concern in the state that these earthquakes are of man-made origin.</description>

The biggest advantage of the theme is that it&amp;rsquo;s neat and clean and looks like other people&amp;rsquo;s work. The biggest disadvantage is that I have 80+ pages of paginated weblog going back into the dim mists of time, and this theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t come out of the box with support for that kind of deep back list in it.</description>

      <description>The task at hand is simple. Whenever a particular airplane is visible overhead, send out a tweet with that notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself with this announcement more than twice an hour, but try not to have too much lag in reporting.
The full stack of hardware and software to do this is not particularly complicated to use once you get it all running, but there are a series of issues and observations along the way that add to the complexity.</description>

      <description>In March 2015 I wrote briefly about plane spotting with dump1090. In short, many airplanes have ADS-B transponders which squawk out their location, airspeed, and current conditions, and you can pick up those transmissions using an inexpensive RTL-SDR tuner stick and a simple antenna.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into this again to see if I can get a better understanding of how it works as well as to take advantage of a year plus of software development.</description>

      <description>Github has changed their pricing strategy to allow individual accounts to have more private repositories. This is a welcome change for accounts like mine.
As part of their change, enterprise pricing has increased. I&amp;rsquo;m told that this will multiply the bills that some companies will see.
This post tests a new private repo, and links to Github pricing for future reference.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easier and faster to fill a page by quoting from others.
The commonplace book is the annotated scrapbook, carefully collecting bits from other writers with just enough commentary and selection to make them your own. If these were written in this era you&amp;rsquo;d call it &amp;ldquo;curation&amp;rdquo;, though I can only think of that word in the context of &amp;ldquo;curated meats&amp;rdquo;, somewhat salty and dry and meant to be preserved for some time.</description>

      <description>Noted elsewhere, saved here for reference, from
Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron, THE CALIFORNIAN IDEOLOGY
 If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones will have to be invented. The search for the holy grail of Artificial Intelligence reveals this desire for the Golem a strong and loyal slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are made of sand. As in Asimov’s Robot novels, the techno-utopians imagine that it is possible to obtain slave like labour from inanimate machines.</description>

      <description>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music responded by playing his hits - &amp;ldquo;Little Red Corvette&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Raspberry Beret&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Purple Rain&amp;rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find. Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.</description>

The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster than my home UVerse.
After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is brew update. You would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed, and that brew is working hard to update everything.</description>

      <description>Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a chicken and onion curry from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious, and worth repeating.
We had the meal with rice, kale, and a daikon raita from food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit with the rest of the table.
The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again, and how many weeks before we have it again?</description>

      <description>APRS is the &amp;ldquo;Automatic Position Reporting Service&amp;rdquo;, a system for sharing information about the position of participating amateur radio stations. Clients transmit position reports on 144.39 Mhz; digipeaters repeat these reports to other monitoring stations; and various IGate sites monitor transmissions and send their findings to aprs.fi which collects worldwide data.
In recent memory there has been an APRS digipeater in Chelsea, Michigan with wide area coverage, good enough to pick up travellers on I-94 west of Ann Arbor.</description>

They encourage you to join their effort, and no high technology is necessary. The network incorporates both readings from automated sensors (about £250) as well as manual readings from gaugeboards or photos.
New as of December 2015 is an interactive flood map.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&amp;rdquo;
Really though it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&amp;rsquo;s had a sale on kale for 99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it from the wrong bin, whatever.
Get home, cook the kale (it&amp;rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually organic, and that I was overcharged.</description>

      <description>A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question of &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for 2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.
This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar systems are next to each other.</description>

Also previously: Split tunnels considered harmful
I have this running in a staging environment and a test environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that it runs on a single host &amp;amp; thus provides neither high availability in the case of Amazon funkiness nor scalability to handle lots of clients.</description>

      <description>Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich. That&amp;rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies, even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.
Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need only point you at the Usenet Cookbook, developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.</description>

      <description>Thanks to everyone for birthday wishes this year.
It is increasingly clear that the place to go for birthday greetings is Facebook, which is absurdly efficient both at providing &amp;ldquo;happy birthday&amp;rdquo; messages as well as acknowledging them.
Additional greetings came in via email, Skype, Twitter, and paper mail (hand written!, complete with reply postage!)
Lunch at a2b3 was a Thursday event, with 14 at the table at Blue Nile. The topic of the conversation was roughly &amp;ldquo;places to take a walk outside in the winter&amp;rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include &amp;ldquo;with a dog&amp;rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get onto Arborwiki.</description>

      <title>Requesting meeting minutes under the Open Meetings Act</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes.
As it happens, there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at Kodi as a possible software core for home media player for the living room. We have a whole rack of CDs and a shelf of LPs from our music-buying days, and I miss being able to listen to them.
Kodi is the software formerly known as XMBC, and XMBC is still the name of the foundation that supports the work. It runs on most systems, and there are several distributions of it specifically for systems like the Raspberry Pi.</description>

Split tunnels are a VPN construction where instead of sending all of your traffic for the network in a single encrypted tunnel that collects everything, you instead route some traffic down the encrypted link and other traffic goes in the clear through your default connection. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that you might have a tunnel configuration with multiple splits if e.</description>

      <description>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that I&amp;rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.
The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&amp;rsquo;re likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were trying to do in the first place.</description>

      <description>Every month or so the Washtenaw County Health Department releases the previous month&amp;rsquo;s health inspection reports. These are published to the county&amp;rsquo;s contracted web service, and a copy of those is extracted for the Food Inspections service designed by Wayne Eaker.
There are 272 inspections for October 2015 and 50 more for November 2015 available. Here are some of the low lights of this month&amp;rsquo;s round of inspections, places where you might want to think about twice before making a visit.</description>

      <description>The first snow of the 2015 season for Ann Arbor happened today, November 21. The forecast is 6 to 10 inches.
Roads are slippery, and there are reports of a number of crashes and cars in the ditch on area freeways. I&amp;rsquo;m listening to the Washtenaw scanner on Broadcastify and it&amp;rsquo;s a steady stream of road run-offs.
Farmers Market was busy but snowy. Holiday greenery was well in evidence. We picked up smoked lake trout, cabbage, garlic, rapini, and a cookie and a donut for my market companions.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; branch.
Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task, with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&amp;rsquo;s docker-openvpn is what I&amp;rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from jpetazzo/dockvpn which solves the same problem slightly differently.
There&amp;rsquo;s a tutorial on Digital Ocean that describes the setup including client-side support.</description>

      <description>Our attic is a three season room at best. In the depths of winter it&amp;rsquo;s really cold, and in the summer time it can be very hot. There&amp;rsquo;s a nod towards climate control but it&amp;rsquo;s a long way from the furnace and the space is just not really practical to equip as full fledged living space.
I have a work table up there (where I am now) with some tools, a few working shortwave radios, a couple of mostly working computers, and a fair measure of junk.</description>

I had a question about productivity - &amp;ldquo;what do you do every day&amp;rdquo; - and the answers were a good mix of attempts to be diligent and questions about whether narrowly focused productivity was even a good goal.
The small productivity approach that has stuck with me is BJ Fogg&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tiny Habits&amp;rdquo; approach, which he writes about on http://tinyhabits.</description>

      <description>alpine is an old school Unix mail user agent. It first arrived on the scene as pine in 1992, and when it appeared I remember how happy I was that there was finally a mailer that I could hand to people who had never seen Unix before and that they would get it and be productive on their 14.4 kb/sec dialup modems.
alpine appeared in 2007 as a rewrite of pine with Unicode support and a new Apache license.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about deleting my LinkedIn account.
I was an early adopter of LinkedIn back when it first got started. It was interesting, fun, cool to collect all your friends.
Now, my sense is that my LinkedIn profile is useless at best and actively unhelpful at worst. Why would I want to publish a standardized autobiography of work experience in a medium that doesn&amp;rsquo;t reward complicated life histories? It&amp;rsquo;s not helpful - what&amp;rsquo;s more, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear that it&amp;rsquo;s ever been helpful for the narrowly defined task of getting work.</description>

The last regular inspection of The Melting Pot by the Washtenaw County Health Department was on May 26, 2015. It turned up 11 violations, and some of them would be the sort of problems that would make you not want to go back.</description>

      <description>It seems that my pattern of going to public meetings includes writing FOIA requests during the meeting, to try to unearth some details of a matter observed at that meeting. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief update on some FOIA requests in progress.
Washtenaw County Health Department. I&amp;rsquo;m temporarily stymied in my quest to determine how often restaurants ask the county to change their inspection reports before they are published. An initial request came back with an estimate of $6000 to comb through every file in the department; an amended request looking for only 30 days of records only limited the cost to $1000.</description>

My every day challenge is to write. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get off that habit if you make too much of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s way too easy to endlessly read the endless Internet, mutter under your breath about how foolish it all is, and not write down your bit of foolishness in return.</description>

      <description>I asked for some documents from Washtenaw County, and they estimated that it would cost over $6100 to produce the records. Apparently the nature of the request was such that they would have had to review 1200 separate files each individually on paper to determine a response. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a $6100 line item in my budget to pay for it, so the best charitable response is &amp;ldquo;no thanks&amp;rdquo;.
There is a question that I want to get at, though, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s attainable for less than $6100.</description>

      <description>As a first approximation, the number of open issues on an open source project that uses Github to track its issues is a metric of software complexity and project maturity.
It&amp;rsquo;s always worrisome to look at a project that has very few issues, because that&amp;rsquo;s usually a signal that no one else is using the code. Every bit of software has incomplete features that prompt a request, and bugs looking for a fix.</description>

      <description>Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Open City Hall&amp;rdquo; is a survey instrument used to gather answers to multiple choice questions. Municipal officials - it&amp;rsquo;s not clear who - put together questions, and citizens are encouraged to tell the city what they think by providing answers. It&amp;rsquo;s run by Peak Democracy, which provides this same service to a number of municipalities.
The current question under review is development on the Library Lot in downtown Ann Arbor.</description>

      <description>The two online social networks that consume idle cycles for me are Twitter and Facebook. They really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be all that different, but of course they are.
Halloween Twitter for me was full of football, ranging from idle banter about the score to full-on intense #goblue insanity as the game went down to its final moments. (The Team won, 29-26, after The Other Team made a crucial mistake at the end).</description>

      <description>Medium is a hosted blogging and discussion board at http://www.medium.com . It&amp;rsquo;s run by Evan Williams, who built Blogger.
The site is very pretty and functional, both for writers and for readers. Authors get a lovely HTML based editor to write their text in, and readers can do highlights and annotations. From a purely technical point of view it&amp;rsquo;s one of the better systems for typing into on the net.</description>

      <description>IRC is an old-school multi-system, multi-channel, multi-network chat infrastructure. It dates from the 1980s, and was inspired in part by the BITNET RELAY systems that effectively sent messages from mainframe to message over virtual punch cards. RFC 1459 described the protocol in 1993.
Slack is a shiny new system also providing multi-channel, multi-network chat. It&amp;rsquo;s very much a product of the 2010s, emerging in 2013 after being used for an internal communications channel at a games company.</description>

From time to time, the Executive Committee holds a meeting to discuss matters of public import. These meetings are public meetings, and the announcements of their times and locations are duly noted on the public posting boards inside City Hall.</description>

      <description>CubicSDR is a software defined radio system for Mac, Linux, and Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s at version 0.1.4-beta as of August 28, 2015, and you can download the binaries from https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR/releases/tag/0.1.4 or the source code from Github at https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicSDR .
My point of comparison for software defined radio is GQRX. When you put CubicSDR on the screen it has a very pretty waterfall display and relatively easy to sort out mouse commands, but it&amp;rsquo;s lacking some of the fancier controls that a more mature program like GQRX has accumulated over time.</description>

      <description>I had a good conversation with Prabal Dutta today about the sort of infrastructure you need to build a very simple bus tracker application for the current iteration of the AAATA&amp;rsquo;s online system.
The desired goal is actually fairly simple: for a single place, identify the approximate location of a bus on a single bus line that serves that place, and alert the rider in time so that they can walk (or run) to catch the bus.</description>

      <description>Macports is a system for bringing 3d party software to the Mac under some kind of organized control. Rather than randomly downloading binaries or sources, you pick from a wide variety of software that&amp;rsquo;s already been ported with all of its dependencies carefully noted.
The process of bringing lots of software online inevitably means that when one system gets updated there are ripple effects up the stack until the software you had been using stops working.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m giving a talk on Over The Top Networks at the Radical/Networks conference in Brooklyn this weekend, October 24-25 2015.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say in what order yet, but&amp;hellip; the best way to predict that is to write down some notes. So here we go.
The premise, briefly stated, is that most successful networks run &amp;ldquo;over the top&amp;rdquo; of existing working networks, and that you can learn a lot from what goes wrong along the way when the underlying network fights back.</description>

      <description>A perspective on Ann Arbor area local government, as seen from fall 2015.
The top level view is that local units of government are struggling with their technology investments, having a difficult time keeping them working, and are unwilling or unable to commit to any sort of &amp;ldquo;open data&amp;rdquo; initiatives as a result of their difficulties with basic operations.
Some examples will illustrate.
The City of Ann Arbor keeps track of a wide range of planning and permit documents through a vendor system called eTrakit.</description>

      <description>Every month the Washtenaw County Health Department releases reports from a previous month&amp;rsquo;s inspections of restaurants in the county. Restaurants are typically inspected twice a year. The inspector looks to see that the state Food Code is enforced, with a particular eye towards identifying violations that result in increased risk to the public of food-borne illness.
Wayne Eaker has put together a searchable and browsable database of these inspections, which is online at food-inspections.</description>

      <description>If you are working on a project in Github, your work isn&amp;rsquo;t always linear. Sometimes the change you make doesn&amp;rsquo;t work completely, so you back a little bit of it out and move forward on a next part. It may take some hacking and sawing (and testing of course) to get a change that just works right.
Projects like to have contributions, but project maintainers don&amp;rsquo;t like to insert noise into their efforts.</description>

      <description>Snap CI is a cloud-based continuous integration system. Like Travis CI, which I have written about here, it lives in the cloud, lets you run programs triggered by GitHub commits, and offers a testing environment for free for open source projects which lets you familiarize yourself with the system before deciding to pay for it for your non-open-source efforts.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking at all of these tools now because this weblog is now managed through a process that involves checking things into Github, which makes it completely suitable for automation for common tasks every time I save a file.</description>

      <description>A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable. Leslie Lamport, 1987
 Amazon Web Services DynamoDB experienced downtime in the N Virginia availability zone early Sunday morning, September 20, 2015. As a result, a number of other AWS services inside N Virginia that depend on DynamoDB also had downtime. Companies and organizations that built services on top of those systems who didn&amp;rsquo;t have geographic load balancing were having problems as well.</description>

      <description>Travis CI is a continuous integration tool, a description which means nothing to people who have never used it. &amp;ldquo;Continuous integration&amp;rdquo; is one of these industry phrases that doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve to illuminate the problem that it describes.
Why would you care? Well, you&amp;rsquo;re working on a project with a bunch of other people, and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of complicated. It might depend on some old code that&amp;rsquo;s fragile and should be tested all the time when it changes, or it might depend some brand-spanking new code that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work and you know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work yet but you want the test system to be less tedious.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with old codebases is that they are missing modern tooling for automated builds, automated testing, and the like.
A second problem with old code is that the maintainers (absent modern tooling) may not know or recognize what dependencies they have.
If an old package is not mostly self-contained, it&amp;rsquo;s likely to have dependencies on other old code. This makes it hard to build, as those older dependencies have either gone offline or have mutated so that the old package doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with the new releases.</description>

      <description>I use Twitter regularly, and will frequently post short things there that reflect some 140 character slice of what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about. That&amp;rsquo;s very quick, but at some level deeply unsatisfying, because how much can you put into 140 characters? Never quite enough.
The challenge is to write up your tweets into something longer. Take the quip and turn it into a lead paragraph, then expand the lead paragraph into three or five or fifteen or fifty more.</description>

      <description>If you have a Bluetooth device attached to a Linux system, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear how to attach that device to a Docker container on that same system.
bluez, the Bluetooth driver for Linux, uses the D-Bus to communicate. This is more complex than a FIFO or socket interface, and thus less easy to obviously say how it should be mapped into the Docker processs and file system space.
The references below show several ways of not doing this task, and hopefully at some point will get answers on how to do it.</description>

      <description>The problem, simply put. You have a messy, real world HTML page; you want to parse it to pull out some key element of it, to pass along to some other task; you want that parsing pipeline to be as compact as possible, because you&amp;rsquo;re running on a small machine, and you&amp;rsquo;re doing the task frequently, and because the page may change out from under you at any time.
Clearly this is not an optimal task to have, but you live with the web you have, not with the web you want to have.</description>

      <description>When you successfully install something complex, and then you fail to document one small thing about how you did it, the inclination is to over-document once you get it working again; thus, this expository account of managing a set of Raspberry Pi devices using the &amp;ldquo;salt&amp;rdquo; system. It&amp;rsquo;s not a complete start to finish writeup, just a pointer to the bits that I had forgotten.
This is mostly experimental at this point, and the collection of devices is relatively small.</description>

      <description>I think this whole &amp;ldquo;deep web&amp;rdquo; thing is mis-stated for the most part.
Since forever there have been Internet-based services that have been unreachable to the public unless you had some kind of specialized access. Private internal networks are the norm at companies of any size. Calling that the &amp;ldquo;hidden web&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;deep web&amp;rdquo; is non-sensical in that it&amp;rsquo;s not really hidden to anyone who has proper access to it - it&amp;rsquo;s just that you (and Google) don&amp;rsquo;t and won&amp;rsquo;t have that access.</description>

Title: Over the top networks, a history of building new systems on the wreckage of the old
New networks often feed off of old ones, in ways that characteristically draw energy from aspects of those networks that are easy to take over and hard to defend.</description>

      <description>I have a new terabyte drive. It&amp;rsquo;s impossibly small, impossibly cheap, and just fast enough to accomplish astounding backup tasks in what seems like not enough time.
It is, however, a mass storage device that depends on rotating magnetic media, and as such it&amp;rsquo;s obsolete.
The drive cost less than $50. For about 10 times that right now, I can buy another terabyte drive that is solid state rather than spinning oxide storage.</description>

The challenge is that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of data out there that changes all the time, and you want to gather it, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s sane, squirrel it away for later analysis, put together a pretty chart so that you can spot check it, feed it into other systems not yet fully dreamed of to cause actions, and so on.</description>

At various times I have learned enough of the database lingo (inner join, outer join etc) to know where I missing things, and I have a lot of experience with common Unix tools (grep, sed, awk) and some newfangled tools (jq, csvkit) to be able to turn a big pile of data into a smaller pile of data. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have database chops per se right now, and sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s a limiting factor on projects when the data sets are too big.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Radio Havana Cuba via a shortwave listening post set up with a software defined radio. The system, Great Lakes Listening Post, has four separate radios covering the 80, 40, 30, and 20 meter bands, all fed into the WebSDR software from PA3FWM. It&amp;rsquo;s located in Michigan, and thus approximates the radio reception I&amp;rsquo;d get from my own receiver.
R Havana Cuba is a good station to listen to.</description>

      <description>Dinner: roasted red peppers, roasted green beans, boiled potatoes, cool and crunchy red pepper and yellow tomato salad with balsamic, kale, and either eggs or bratwurst depending on your preferences. I really prefer cooking in the summertime!

      <title>GQRX based radio scanner with gqrx-scan</title>

      <description>gqrx-scan is a Perl script that drives the remote control of the gqrx software defined radio receiver to turn it into a scanner and automated recording tool.
The GQRX remote control protocol is well documented and fairly simple, which means that the bulk of the Perl script has to do with setting and getting options. You can drive your scanner from the GQRX configuration file, or you can monitor a specific band or range of frequencies.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some time now, and since November I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.
Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&amp;rsquo;s usually a lot of duplicates; at less than 100 I&amp;rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&amp;rsquo;s something to be done).</description>

      <description>At the corner of Ashley and Madison in Ann Arbor is the Washtenaw Dairy.
Ashley Street is named after &amp;ldquo;Big Jim&amp;rdquo; Ashley, an Ohio congressman and promoter and builder of what became the Ann Arbor Railroad.
Madison Street is presumably named after President James Madison, as a number of downtown streets have presidential names.
There is an Ashley, Michigan in Gratiot County between Owosso and Alma, on the route of the railroad.</description>

      <description>Fortunately, a lot of parts were replacable, and the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be replaced were returned intact with all of their data on them. Back in business.
I am happy to have paper notebooks and to know how to use them, and to also have good enough backup systems that I didn&amp;rsquo;t panic. There are a few very small things I need to learn, mostly about Github and how to manage subprojects.</description>

      <description>This passage from the English language Wikipedia has been repeatedly removed from the narrative of the explosion in Tianjin, China.
 Chinese authorities reportedly attempted to censor professional and social media reports. Social media users have reported that their posts regarding the blasts are being deleted, with the words &amp;ldquo;Tianjin&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;explosion&amp;rdquo; having become the most censored on Weibo. Journalists were kept away from the blast site. It was also reported that eight hours after the explosion, Tianjin Television was not reporting on the event, instead showing soap operas.</description>

      <description>Lunch at The Broken Egg with the a2b3 crew. We had 17 people show up, which is about 2x what had been the normal attendance. The restaurant was very accomodating, and everyone was well fed.
Organizing lunch is the highlight of my week.
Lots of things were discussed, here&amp;rsquo;s a few of them:
The Perseid meteor shower peaked last night, notes Linda Diane Feldt, who saw a few shooting stars from her cabin in Lyndon Township.</description>

      <description>Too much of the stuff that I write is very short. I&amp;rsquo;d like to sort out how to have more long form writing.
From memories of times past trying to do this, the struggle was in coming up with structure. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to push out a 5 paragraph essay in comparison with structuring a 20 or 50 or 200 page tome.
I know that people have taken blogs as first drafts of long form writing, and heaven knows I have enough raw word count to start to make something from.</description>

      <description>The a2b3 lunch this week was at Mi Compadre, a Mexican place on Packard. We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.
I was inspired this week for the lunch question by going to the Workantile lunch on Wednesday, which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce yourself around the table, and answer some simple question. At Workantile the prompt was simply &amp;ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&amp;rdquo;, and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery.</description>

      <description>Wakatime tracks your time if you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard. &amp;ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&amp;rdquo; is the tag line.
That which is measured, improves. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind.</description>

x.ai has a new service in development, an automated personal assistant that helps you schedule meetings.

      <description>Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when voter turnout is very low.
I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on, or the perpetually politically curious.</description>

      <description>In the case of experts &amp;ldquo;writing down what they know&amp;rdquo;, and incorporating that data into an expert system or knowledge base.
One of the challenges is expecting that the expert can write down everything that they know, all at once, in such a way that there&amp;rsquo;s no internal inconsistencies.
The world usually works in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s changing fast enough that an expert with a written memory bank of a certain size is always holding as &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; in that memory bank something that is demonstrably false, just because the world shifts out from under them.</description>

      <description>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to, in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&amp;rsquo;s one way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.
The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages. Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many advertisements as we will stand.</description>

First, the upbeat Bloomberg Business article of July 10, 2015:

      <description>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away. I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).
The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch a postcard from the command line of my Mac.</description>

      <description>A first round of postcards sent via Lob.com have arrived or are nearly arrived at their destinations. The initial experience of sending them made it clear that I need to do some simple user interface improvements. I think I can cope with the current situation on producing the card back photo, but again there&amp;rsquo;s more work to be done making the text on the page wonderful.
A reasonable question is, why do you send them?</description>

      <description>Blog every day, whether you want to or not.
Pick a topic, learn it well, and write about it as you learn it. Or pick a topic you know really well already and teach to it. Sometimes you can do both.
The time spent blogging can&amp;rsquo;t be any less worthwhile than time spent on Facebook or Twitter. The exchange is, instead of clicking the like button and the favorite button, you actually have to think a little bit and write something down that makes sense.</description>

      <description>Every month the Washtenaw County Health Department does a round of restaurant inspections. Wayne Eaker built an importer that pulls in data from the site that hosts the official county inspections, and is storing the inspection data on Github to make it easier for the next person who wants to build a nice interface to all the data.
Wayne was good enough to find a spot to host an interface to this data that lets you browse through it; you can find it at</description>

      <description>I bought a little box of tomatillos from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them.
Suggestions so far include:
 fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa raw tomatillo salsa a la Rick Bayless fried with onions and then add to scrambled eggs for tortillas baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti in pastel de Montezuma  What I ended up making was a very simplified version of Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos, reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad. The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&amp;rsquo;ve been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes and what-not. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to review old words.
One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at times system called Zemanta. Zemanta would figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions for related links, both to things that you had written as well as to things other people had written.</description>

      <description>Daily coffee and wifi at Argus Farm Stop, outside in the sunshine under a lovely red umbrella canopy. Espresso over ice and a day-old olive twist. The view is of a Sky Trak lift at the construction site across moving materials to the back of The Mark, a building that&amp;rsquo;s going up where the car wash used to be.
 The news of the day is a death on State Street.</description>

      <description>Little Bird is a system that helps you discover influencers and experts in any topic. I&amp;rsquo;m at the very start of a 7 day trial. Marshall Kirkpatrick is CEO of Little Bird, and he has been active on Twitter posting interesting ideas about influence marketing - and given that it seemed prudent to give the product a try.
Pricing is aimed at agencies, not individuals, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at this product through the eyes of people doing &amp;ldquo;social listening&amp;rdquo; for a living, tracking the messages that appear on a topic and either quietly making sense of what is happening or actively engaging with those people to try to influence their opinions.</description>

      <description>Out for a bike ride to Malletts Creek Branch Library after a delicious lunch of BBQ at Ricewood.
 One of the challenges of low overhead custom postcard making is getting an image manipulation pipeline that kicks out photos that a appropriately cropped and sized. The latest challenge is identifying the single command line that will turn a photo from my phone&amp;rsquo;s camera into an appropriately sized image for the card with a minimum of cropping, distortion, and manual file transfers.</description>

      <description>I hope to see you at Docker Detroit&amp;rsquo;s kickoff meeting, to be held at RIIS, 1250 Stephenson Highway, Suite 200 in Troy, MI starting at 6:00 p.m. tonight July 22 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ll be coming in from Ann Arbor. The venue is between 14 Mile and Maple behind Beaumont Hospital. Google Maps suggests that because of construction on I-75 in that area you might want to head north on Campbell instead of taking the I-75 / I-696 interchange north.</description>

      <description>At Roos, an espresso over ice with a little half and half and a hard boiled egg. It&amp;rsquo;s a very compact breakfast. The espresso is served in an appropriately sized glass mug and tastes like the strongest little iced latte you will ever have.
 On my Mac, run &amp;lsquo;boot2docker upgrade&amp;rsquo;. That gets me up to current 1.7.1 revision of everything.

      <description>bocker is Docker (or at least a good sized subset of it) in 100 lines of shell script. I suppose the point is that even though there&amp;rsquo;s a huge world of hype surrounding containerization as a next step of systems management, when you get down to it, it&amp;rsquo;s just not that complicated.</description>

      <description>A productive afternoon with Mohan Kartha in which I opened a great many tabs in Chrome. This bit of writing to close those out. Elixir Vitae is a great spot for writing - lots of quiet noise from the coolers to keep a background hum, and close to the bus station.
 I&amp;rsquo;m sorting out the simplest task that I&amp;rsquo;d like to do with Node-RED, now that I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running it under Docker in a configuration that&amp;rsquo;s reliable enough that it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s stable.</description>

      <description>Espresso over ice at ERC South Main. This is now my favorite summer drink. Served in a cup with enough ice and you get the makings of a very strong iced latte, just add a little half and half.
The work of the morning is finishing up yesterday&amp;rsquo;s work on sending postcards with Lob.com. Key to this effort is resizing your favorite images so that they meet the template. Fortunately I had the presence of mind seven years ago to write up my notes on using sips and Imagemagick for image manipulation and that helped.</description>

      <description>A bus labeled &amp;ldquo;TRAINING&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t take that one.
Kayakers in bright yellow kayaks on the Huron River under the bridge on Fuller Road.
Would it be too much to ask to have wifi actually on the blue bus, or is it more reasonable to expect that people have cell data coverage everywhere and that wifi on the bus is for long haul buses like Megabus?
I&amp;rsquo;m happy that with Hugo I can have a reasonably complete local blogging environment completely independent of having Internet access, so long as I have my computer with me.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a warm but pleasant mid-summer late Monday morning, and I&amp;rsquo;m visiting the first cafe inbound on a walk to town. Biggby Packard is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so.
Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&amp;rsquo;s not really enough here to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in here before when I was the only patron for more than an hour but this morning there&amp;rsquo;s a few more people sitting typing.</description>

      <description>Lob.com has an API to send postcards-as-a-service ($0.70 per each, full custom both sides). Details at https://lob.com/services/postcards . It works, but all of the user interface is up to you; if you know a good service for delivering a single full-custom postcard with postage that actually has a user interface and not an API for less than $1.00 each, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll update here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started checking in a few tiny utility programs that exercise the Lob API.</description>

      <description>A simple recipe that you can order from your favorite barista: an espresso shot over ice. Leave enough room to add a spot of half and half. Cold, refreshing, and very strong.
To try: a shot of espresso over shaved ice. I think this is doable at Ann Arbor Farmers Market where you&amp;rsquo;d go to the stall where a granny is selling shaved ice, and then walk a plain snow cone over to the Roos Roast stand for your espresso shot.</description>

      <description>Lior Zoref has a new book out called Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything (Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the new shelf at Mallett&amp;rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday afternoon. Mallett&amp;rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot to be on a warm day.
 The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits without repeating the author&amp;rsquo;s technique of using the word &amp;ldquo;Mindsharing&amp;rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity.</description>

Arborwiki&amp;rsquo;s page on Hazen Schumacher has memories of him and his program. The jazz collection that he assembled and all of the master tapes for the show are now at the Jazz Museum Bix Eiben Hamburg, and 24 editions of the program are up online for your listening at http://bixrevisited.</description>

      <description>Midland G-227 GMRS radio, quantity two, a gift from the Wells-Becker Motorcycle Emporium in Dexter, Michigan.
I replaced batteries in both of them, they take 4xAAA.
Radio 1 successfully hears static when the (M) monitor button is depresssed; Radio 2 hears nothing.
A manual is at http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html which describes the frequencies of the 22 channels it can transmit on. A reasonable next step is to get my NooElec SDR tuner out and see if I can monitor a transmission.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a collection of text that you want to annotate with some metadata, like categories and tags. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to set aside ahead of time exactly which tags you want to use, but you want to catch through some test or lint step that you&amp;rsquo;ve done something wrong by typing &amp;ldquo;apples&amp;rdquo; into a field that really has &amp;ldquo;apple&amp;rdquo; most of the time.</description>

      <description>The Detroit Sound Conservancy went to the vacant Book Building in Detroit on July 7, 2015 to salvage the collection of the defunct Graystone International Jazz Museum. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice writeup in MLive, Graystone jazz artifacts, forgotten in Detroit skyscraper, now being preserved. Photographer Doug Coombe went along to document the effort with a photo set on Facebook.
 &amp;ldquo;We knew that things were bad,&amp;rdquo; said DSC&amp;rsquo;s Founder and President Carleton Gholz about the neglected collection, but Gholz didn&amp;rsquo;t know how bad until he discovered many of the former museum&amp;rsquo;s records were broken and strewn across the floor.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re writing away, and you hit &amp;ldquo;publish&amp;rdquo;, and the thing you pieced together flings its way through the ether to some audience, real or imagined. The next day it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible to find again unless you manage to produce the precise incantation into a search engine. There is some long-lasting trail, to be sure, easy enough to dredge up if someone is motivated by money or curiousity, but for the most part the social networks of today (Facebook, Twitter) generate most of their energy from capturing the attention of the moment.</description>

      <description>One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same; the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that look different. For instance:
There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.</description>

We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make sure that the things that needed to get done got done.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying my best to get this blog ready for production. The tasks remaining include the following.
 Get a reasonable home page with pagination. Somehow I need to provide some kind of access to almost 2000 posts, and they don&amp;rsquo;t all fit on a single page. Sort through the design to make old things reachable, and then worry next about the formatter. (This is done at least minimally, though the provided paginator interface uses a list structure that&amp;rsquo;s not nice.</description>

      <description>This weblog, which may or may not ever see the light of day, is about a great many things.
There are other blogs waiting to be written that don&amp;rsquo;t have that infinite vista; they could easily be much more narrow. What, then, do you write about? Let&amp;rsquo;s count some of the options.
 Docker on the Raspberry Pi, following Hypriot&amp;rsquo;s lead. Just Docker in general, and Dockerizing various things. Recipes, since I have a bunch already.</description>

      <description>Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception.
I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; category, and also created a &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like a subcategory but not really&amp;hellip;well it is as long as I am careful about it.
Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use of Gopher as a cookbook.</description>

      <description>One of the challenges in getting things started is figuring out where the end product is going to live. Hugo has its own web server which is pretty nice, but since it generates static pages, the results can really go anywhere.
This tutorial goes through the process in excruciating detail
http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/
but somehow fails to make it easy. What I&amp;rsquo;d like is a publishing workflow that just like the normal Hugo workflow puts things online instantly once they are built.</description>

      <description>Mac and Goat calls for goat cheese; we generally use a goat gouda or a goat cheddar, both of which are usually available at the local Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s. Feel free to substitute any hard cheese that melts well in your recipe.
The dish also calls for rice pasta, but again feel free to substitute; you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for something like a rotini which handles the sauce well.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</description>

      <description>Themes can be customized by editing the top matter, or by directly changing the theme. The challenge is understanding enough of how the moving parts interconnect to make it do what you want it to do, or at least enough of them so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a blog that just looks like a weak ripoff of someone else&amp;rsquo;s.
This tutorial
http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13
does a very nice job of helping you walk through the simple bits.</description>

      <description>The task of the night was getting a few years worth of Typepad posts into Hugo.
My first step was to convert to Jekyll format, which I did using this typepad_to_jekyll Ruby gem:
https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll
You then need to do a few things to get the Jekyll files exactly right for Hugo:
 Change the date format Rewrite the Categories Download and relink all of the images  Changing the format for &amp;ldquo;date&amp;rdquo; was a one-liner in perl with the -i (&amp;ldquo;edit in place&amp;rdquo;) flag.</description>

      <description>Jonathan and I went to Paradise, a Vietnamese place in the Colonade that also serves Chinese food. He got Mongolian Beef, and I got pho deluxe. It was perfectly adequate if not spectacular. The topic of conversation was an elaborate storyline in a game that involved animatronics in a creepy Chuck E. Cheese type abandoned pizza parlor.
We then went to the Malletts Creek library, until about 4:00 p.m. I worked on Hugo and constructed a theme from scratch.</description>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/wow-that-is-fast/</guid>
      <description>So 634 pages from my Github Gollum based Wiki markup all got imported into Hugo and it rendered all of them in 828 ms, or basically under a second to pull in everything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. Astonishingly fast.
Alas, those files while they are in Markdown are not really ready for direct import, since they have [[double brackets]] everywhere that get uglified. The other limiting factor is the date marker that&amp;rsquo;s not included with them so they all show up as January 1, 0001 which is funny the first few times and then not funny.</description>

      <description>Progress, actually quite a lot of it:
The problem, neatly stated. Docker is good for bringing up single services (&#34;microservices&#34;), but sometimes your application needs more than one thing running for the whole thing to work. Enter &#34;docker compose&#34;, formerly &#34;fig&#34;, which automates the process of running various Docker commands in the right order with the right arguments all driven from a configuration file. As described by their documentation:
 Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker.</description>

      <description>Of course you never read the comments, but you might read the commentary on the comments. Here&#39;s The Verge&#39;s decision to turn off comments on its stories for the summer:
 And sometimes it gets too intense. What we&#39;ve found lately is that the tone of our comments (and some of our commenters) is getting a little too aggressive and negative — a change that feels like it started with GamerGate and has steadily gotten worse ever since.</description>

      <description>Your comments excluded, of course, dear reader, though there are more posts here than comments by people on those posts. The reference is to the interminable slog of newspaper comments which place a long stream of dreck at the end of that carefully edited story.
I miss the days of carefully considered letters to the editor - when you could count on not every letter getting published, when you were limited to a certain number of words, and when if you were wildly off-topic your words might never see the light of day.</description>

The Internet spin on this is to wonder how Bitcoin will be used to evade currency controls. From Financial Post, Bitcoin is the real winner in Greece crisis:
 The main driver for bitcoin prices seem to be Greek buyers.</description>

      <description>squid is a web caching system. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don&#39;t have the data, and way faster when you do.</description>

 The state Bureau of Protective Services confirmed Newsome and one other person were arrested. They are charged with defacing a monument, which is a violation of state law 10-11-315. The law has not been used since it was passed in 2000 during another push to remove the flag from the capitol.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve deleted Facebook from my phone, though I haven&#39;t closed out my account there. Look for me to be there less and here (on this blog) more.
Facebook is a never ending stream. You start to look at it, and you are never done. There&#39;s never a &#34;congratulations, you are all caught up&#34; message to be found. It&#39;s just too big to make sense of, and too much of a potential time sink.</description>

      <description>The opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges reads in part:
 No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage.</description>

      <description>Noted as an example of &#34;how do they do that&#34;
 The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation.
 Kinetrics has a page on RTDS describing how it&#39;s used.</description>

      <description>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don&#39;t have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you&#39;re expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively.
I&#39;m making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python.</description>

      <description>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough.
Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes.</description>

      <description>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called runC. It&#39;s a &#34;lightweight universal plumbing&#34; that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure.  To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.
 Because of Docker&#39;s start on Linux systems, it&#39;s been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X.</description>

Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting.
One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online. It had several typoes and missspellings, including an incorrect reference to statute.</description>

Minus: no lights, no bell, no helmets. More specifically, I am told that the lights come on automatically, and that there is a bell somewhere, but I didn&#39;t find it and it wasn&#39;t labeled. I did have a helmet with me so I wore that.</description>

I installed all kinds of crap on that machine to test it out, and never uninstalled a lot of it. It turns out that some judicious uninstalls seemed to help a lot to keep the load average down. Some hints to my future self if these ever re-emerge:</description>

      <description>Some notes before I try to do the build.
The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick.
Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket.
The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.</description>

      <description>My goal for the week was to empty out my inbox sufficiently that I would be able to make progress on some programming tasks that are hard to do when there&#39;s distractions. The inbox got all the way down to zero, and that meant that there was a chunk of evening time suitable for hacking. Happy to report that the result of this is Node-RED running on a Raspberry Pi under Docker on top of Hypriot.</description>

      <description>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.
For my dad&#39;s old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again.</description>

      <description>The rented lakes of my childhood by Marge Piercy  I remember the lakes of my Michigan childhood. Here they are called ponds. Lakes belonged to summer, two-week vacations that my father was granted by Westinghouse when we rented some cabin. Never mind the dishes with spiderweb cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce pans, the crusted black frying pans. Never mind the mattresses shaped like the letter V. Old jangling springs. Moldy bathrooms.</description>

      <description>The City of Ann Arbor does not have a full time building official, and the routine operations of the building department are suffering as a result.
I was at a Building Board of Appeals meeting today, 14 May 2015. The group just barely met quorum and had just three members seated, with one member absent and one vacant position. The regular staff member who handles the meetings is on medical leave, and the building official who had been present at previous meetings (Ralph Welton) has left the city&#39;s employment under circumstances which have not been fully and adequately explained.</description>

      <description>This is the AAATA Route 5 summer 2015 inbound to Ann Arbor schedule, as it looks as embedded with ViewerJS. I note on Chrome on Mac OS X that the map is white on black instead of the black on white that I see in Preview.
Report is that this looks like a grey box on an iPhone.
I note that on Windows Phone 8.1 it loads slowly and the fonts are very blocky, and the map is a somewhat legible black on white.</description>

      <description>I have a new Windows Phone and overall I really like it. We bought it used and unlocked and it&#39;s running on the Ting network, which means that in addition to being an interesting device that looks really nice it&#39;s also quite economical.
That said, there&#39;s one feature on the phone that wasn&#39;t a feature last night. I was making arrangements to take my son home, and was expecting a call from him.</description>

There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language.</description>

      <description>Big data is any data that you can&amp;rsquo;t analyze with the tools that are commonly known to you. For many people, that means a table bigger than what Excel can handle. What you consider &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; depends on your capabilities and the tools and systems you have available to you. Sometimes people will be led down a weird path where problems that are straightforward to solve with one set of tools are also solvable with great difficulty with another set of tools; see Adam Drake, Command line tools can be 235x faster than your Hadoop cluster , for one illuminating instance of this.</description>

      <description>As seen with gqrx on my Mac.

The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I&#39;m looking at.</description>

      <description>Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn&#39;t have school and so I didn&#39;t actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.
The first piece of the new routine is getting to the Ann Arbor YMCA. If the weather is nice and I don&#39;t have anything else going on, it&#39;s a nice bike ride; if I&#39;m making a car trip into town for school, it&#39;s close enough to be a good next stop.</description>

The good folks at Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center and at the National Weather Service in White Lake, MI did a training session at Pioneer High School. The class was concurrent with a Michigan ballroom dancing competition so there was music and festivities and accomplished looking dancers to enjoy before the class.
I was there with John Hritz KD8MKE and Ann Hanson.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.
After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit.</description>

      <description>My Twitter feed was full of air crash news this morning. Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in the French Alps, killing all passengers aboard. Wikipedia has a good summary, perhaps as good as any.
What was unusual about the crash was that there was no distress call, and that the plane descended rapidly and steadily into the ground without veering once from its course.
Of note in this regard is another European flight on a similar aircraft some months earlier.</description>

      <description>Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman&#39;s Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones.
The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map.</description>

      <description>First made in 2002, these old candybar style phones are virtually indestructible. My son popped my Ting SIM into it and it&#39;s working fine.
Not so my old Nexus 4, which did a face plant on the sidewalk, cracked the screen and screwed up the digitizer. It dates only from 2013.
I&#39;ll price out fixing the Nexus 4, but I suspect it&#39;s not going to be worth repairing. (We&#39;ll see.) And then there&#39;s the question of what kind of device do you want to carry around with you all the time, how much you want to spend and whether it makes sense to retreat to simpler technology for a while until the answer is more clear.</description>

      <description>Photo credit: Ryan Eby, from his aurora photoset on Flickr.

I first got word that there was a chance of northern lights from the Michigan VHF-UHF Society mailing list, an amateur radio group. When the aurora activity is high, the VHF amateur radio bands (2 meter and 6 meter) get increased range, so ham radio operators with this interest keep an alert out.
The Aurora Page at Michigan Tech has a lot of useful links to space weather forecasts.</description>

      <description>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility company. I know it won&amp;rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies have at least one county that they only provide service to part of), but as a start it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good one.</description>

      <description>style leaflet(data=&#34;/Users/emv/tmp/N.geojson&#34;,dest=tempdir(),popup=&#34;*&#34;,style=style)  So, progress.
One process, written in python, takes an Excel file provided by the county and creates a GeoJSON file from it. Addresses in the file are geocoded. The original file has a set of restaurant inspection reports and three kinds of inspection problems found; I add a fourth &#34;score&#34; variable that&#39;s derived in some way from those three.
A second process (code above) is in R using the LeafletR graphing package.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been fond of maps and graphs for a long time, but haven&#39;t had a good set of tools to play with that easily generate decent versions of same from various data sets I&#39;ve found or accumulated.
The small hope is that a little bit of hacking on the right tools will fix this.
One of the tools of choice is R, a language for statistics and data analysis. It&#39;s tremendously powerful and a bit complicated, but I&#39;m not trying to learn the whole thing; rather, I&#39;m after just the barest minimum so that I can competently generate a scatterplot of data and place it onto a map.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite weather forecasts comes from forecast.io. This screen shows the ensemble set of forecasts they have for temperature for tomorrow (February 20, 2015), highlighting the 8:00 a.m. reading.

You&#39;ll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is RAP from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Looking at their set of pages they have a nice cold temperature forecast map.</description>

      <description>I woke up this morning thinking about ways to improve my sense of direction. (Don&#39;t ask me why.) Here&#39;s some previous work on the internet that I had found for wearable devices that give you an always-on compass reading and some ideas for more.
First, some prior art. How to make a tactile compass feedback belt is a typical design, with about $150 in parts. In short you wire up an electronic compass to a series of tiny cell-phone style vibrator motors, and you position a dozen or so motors along a belt.</description>

      <description>Our living room has lovely (old) wooden windows. When it&#39;s cold, the windows get cold. Last year we got some lovely thermal curtains to insulate.
I thought I&#39;d use some of the equipment I had to see just how cold the windows were and how much warmer the curtains are to the touch.
The setup:
Macbook Air running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), Node-RED 0.9.1, Freeboard, TI Sensortag. I&#39;m using RabbitMQ as my MQTT message passing system, but that&#39;s not strictly necessary for this application.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is considering hiring &#34;downtown ambassadors&#34; to patrol city streets, help out visitors, and keep the downtown neat and clean and welcoming. As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People&#39;s Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law.</description>

      <description>Vellum closed in January 2015. The Ann Arbor News story tells the part of the story of an innovative kitchen that was &#34;like a laboratory&#34;, and a subsequent format change to a more mainstream menu. The restaurant had a two year run.
What&#39;s missing from the narrative is the prompt from the county health department that forced the change. Vellum&#39;s menu at the outset used the &#34;sous vide&#34; cooking technique to produce its most innovative dishes.</description>

      <description>Ann Arbor City Council is meeting tonight, 5 January 2015, at 7:00 p.m. the Washtenaw County Administration Building. Here are some highlights from the agenda.
Three public hearings are on the docket. The public will get a chance to weigh in on a proposed amendment to the chicken-keeping ordinance and two hearings on downtown zoning.
The chicken-keeping ordinance (Section 107) would be amended to allow people to keep 6 chickens instead of the current 4, and to allow people to keep chickens without getting the mandatory consent of the neighbors.</description>

      <description>The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65 pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into the machine.</description>

Trying to find reliable information about an event in progress half way around the world is always a challenge. Twitter and Facebook are good at moving information quickly around the globe, but they send sense and nonsense in equal parts, and it&#39;s easy to read things that are speculation or even outright falsehoods.</description>

There are three types of problems reported by county health. To simplify reporting I score them proportionately to see which locations go to the top of the list. 6 locations had no problems at all:

      <description>From Scientific American, [For Sale: “Your Name Here” in a Prestigious Science Journal] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/for-sale-your-name-here-in-a-prestigious-science-journal/)
 “Beggers funnel plot” is particularly revealing. There is no such thing as a Beggers funnel plot. &#34;It doesn&#39;t exist. That&#39;s the point,&#34; says Guillaume Filion, a biologist at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain (pdf). A statistician named Colin Begg and another statistician named Matthias Egger each invented tests and tools to look for biases that creep into meta-analyses.</description>

      <description>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don&#39;t have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.
The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that.</description>

The key insight into the demise of this 38 year old publication is that this was their best year for online web traffic, yet their revenues were heading straight down.
 Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb&#39;s, we had healthy profits and revenue, almost all of it from advertising.</description>

      <description>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there&#39;s a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what&#39;s being said on RF and vice versa.
websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum.</description>

      <description>Nothing personal, but it&#39;s time to take a break from Twitter.
I tried to do this back in 2008 when it was still possible to have a reasonable conversation on a blog about whether you were or weren&#39;t going to participate in a new social media experiment. Nowadays Twitter is big business, and I don&#39;t feel like I have to justify myself to my friends for why I think it&#39;s time to take a rest from 24x7 news and celebrity updates.</description>

      <description>This is what our house sounds like when the furnace fan is running - a steady 240 hz hum with harmonics at 120 hz and about 360 hz.
The graph is from iSpectrum, an easy to set up audio spectrum analyzer from Dog Park Software.</description>

      <description>I used Google Inbox for a little while, but gave up on it. It turns out that the routine I have with Google&#39;s Gmail for handling inbound correspondence is pretty good, and Inbox was too different from Gmail to make it worthwhile to do an easy transition.
I don&#39;t know if my workflow for handling message traffic is perfect, but it seems to be pretty good. Email comes in, I read it, and anything that deserves further attention but can&#39;t be handled right away is starred.</description>

      <description>November 25, 2014, midnight. FAA has issued TFR affecting inbound flights. Airport is still open. Does not impact departures.
&amp;mdash; Lambert-STL Airport (@flystl) November 25, 2014 
FAA TFR, NOTAM : 4/0271 Location : FERGUSON, MO, Tuesday, November 25, 2014 UTC. Not for navigation.

Flightstats shows that traffic is being diverted from the airport.

The FAA has issued a TFR over #Ferguson. But unlike last time, commercial flights are diverting away from @flystl.</description>

      <description>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues. By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status. This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.
I&#39;ve been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while, using its milestones feature to track categories.</description>

      <description>Kinder Morgan runs a number of pipelines that carry natural gas through the United States. Detailed maps are available that show the current status for these pipelines.

This map is from the Tennessee Gas Pipeline which carries gas from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast US. The map is accompanied by a series of operational data and alerts that tell gas shippers what to expect, provide gas consumption forecasts based on the weather, and alerts users of the pipeline of exceptional events in the case of equipment failure.</description>

      <description>When ordinary weather maps don&#39;t tell you what the worst of the weather is like out there, I turn to these sources for information.
 Twitter, especially. A search this morning for &#34;ann arbor ice&#34; gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around. Streets and highways were bad, and a Delta flight slid off the runway at DTW. For Michigan weather follow the #miwx hashtag.</description>

      <description>Some questions to ask while you&#39;re trying to sort this out.
 Draw a diagram of the entire system, from one end to the other. Label the parts. Identify especially the parts that &#34;just work&#34;, because undoubtably there are unexpected cases that won&#39;t work just when you need them to work.  Identify the message flows through the system. Where do signals get generated, where do they get retransmitted, where do they get changed and when does a human interpret them?</description>

      <description>Wake up, get a cup of coffee, start typing. That&#39;s a pretty typical pattern for me these days, and I&#39;m trying to make sense of whether it&#39;s a good one.
The hardest part of making a morning typing routine work is to try to figure out what indeed it is that you are focusing on in those early caffeinated hours. There are lots of competitors for the morning attention, including yesterday&#39;s inbox, the overnight news, and the steady tick of Twitter and Facebook.</description>

      <description>wjchat is a weekly Wednesday night chat session on Twitter. &#34;wj&#34; in this case is short for &#34;web journalism&#34;. Tonight&#39;s session is on using social media for long term editorial projects.
The longest long-term editorial project I&#39;m working on that&#39;s relevant to this is Arborwiki, which is now part of the Localwiki project. It&#39;s a local encyclopedia of the Ann Arbor area, and as such it&#39;s a very useful spot to accumulate the back story for any story that you want to tell.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m working on a project that will remain nameless. The sponsor of the project asked me not to write about it, and I agreed. I&#39;m spending a lot of time communicating about the project, but those communications are all private. It&#39;s intensely frustrating.
I learn best by writing about what I&#39;m doing, in enough detail to capture some of the very small bits of what had happened while it was happening.</description>

      <description>Note to self: if you get asked to be part of a project, and then subsequently get asked to not talk about that project, renegotiate the terms of that effort promptly. Non-disclosure has wide ranging consequences, and that&#39;s especially true when you habitually learn about how something works by writing about it. In retrospect, I should have walked out of the room. That would have been brave and not foolish.</description>

      <description>A cautionary tale.
What&#39;s the value of an idea? Consider that some ideas might have a negative value; indeed that most of them might. It may take you some substantial investment to test out your idea, to prove it, to build something minimal to show people that it was real. And then when you&#39;re ready with it there might be a net result that you finally have talked to enough people that you know that you need to scrap it and start over.</description>

      <description>More about the song The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald on the 70s Pop blog.
 Death and destruction: why were we so obsessed with it in the 70s? So many gruesome, heart wrenching unhappy endings were fodder for pop songs and we gleefully bought the 45s. Well maybe not gleefully, maybe with a maudlin curiosity. This Gordon Lightfoot tune is a great example, a story song about the SS Edmund Fitzgerald sinking in 1975, killing everyone on board.</description>

      <description>CHARTING THE WOLVERINE: MAP COLLAGE
Elaine S. Wilson
Elaine S. Wilson chronicles the experience of riding Amtrak’s train from Ann Arbor to Chicago by combining maps, aerial drawings and watercolor images. The prints are the result of over five years of research in map collections at the University of Michigan, Library of Congress and Yale University, as well as countless trips along the tracks to find sites identified from the windows of the train at which to set up her easel.</description>

      <description>Haven&#39;t cooked any of these yet, but there&#39;s some recipes to work through:
Ricki Heller: Chickpea, Potato and Tomato Stew. Uses tahini to enrich the sauce.
Fit Pregnancy: Chickpea, Potato and Tomato Stew with Chard . With chard, paprika, parsley.
The First Mess: moroccan-style vegetable + chickpea stew . Sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, and a cinnamon+coriander+cumin spice.
The Picky Eater: Indian Chickpea and Potato Stew. Curry is the flavor here, and cilantro replaces parsley.</description>

      <description>Where do you write something that&#39;s longer than a tweet, but shorter than an essay?
There&#39;s a space on the net for things that you put together that don&#39;t fit into a tweet, but that also don&#39;t really require a whole long essay.
I&#39;ve been writing these in my blog for years, and so I have a bit of infrastructure put together for organizing, collecting, and finding them again. A lot of people who are on Twitter don&#39;t have a blog, though, and so their fragments stay fragmentary or get lost in the mists of Twitter time.</description>

      <description>APPLESAUCE At farmer&#39;s market, ask the farmer for a half a peck or a peck of &#34;mixed seconds for sauce&#34;. Use whatever apples they give you. In November 2014 I paid $7 for a peck of mixed seconds at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market.
Quarter and core many apples; do not peel. Cover bottom of pot with water, put in the apples, half (or a whole) orange (pref. organic, with seeds removed), one (or two) cinnamon sticks.</description>

      <description>Symptoms include no audio inputs when a headset is plugged in, but the built-in mic works fine when the headset is not plugged in.
sudo killall coreaudiod is one suggested fix.
This superuser.com article tells you how to reload Mac audio drivers without rebooting.
Thanks to Mohan Kartha for helping sort this out; still not convinced I can adequately fix it with these tools, or even that I have diagnosed the issue.</description>

      <description>This comes out kind of like a lasagna and is designed the same way: lots of layers.
Ingredients:
 one package tortillas (whole wheat, corn, or flour) one can tomatoes with chiles one can black beans 1/2 jar corn relish one package shredded cheese  assemble in layers, roughly as so:
 tortillas tomatoes with chiles tortillas beans cheese tortillas relish cheese  Bake in a 350 degree oven; I left it in for about an hour, until the top was nicely browned and not singed.</description>

      <description>tilde.club now has Usenet news, of the very old fashioned sort where there is only a small handful of newsgroups and where people are still figuring out their newsreaders and news hosting systems and where there&#39;s no spam.
Instructions are at ~emv/usenet, such as they are; looking to get enough people on board so that there&#39;s a reasonable next step of setting up a feed infrastructure of some kind eventually. The current set of directions are rather plain, but it will get more fancy, just fancy enough to bootstrap but not much more.</description>

      <description>I checked out a 27 watt solar panel with a very beefy battery from the Ann Arbor District Library. The battery also charges via a wall wart, and provides either 5V USB power or switchable 10V-19V DC. I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a solar panel, and my conclusion is that 27 watts is overkill for my normal use case which is powering my phone. The battery was awesome, but again overkill - too heavy to be an everyday carry.</description>

      <description>The next major ancient Internet subsystem I&#39;d like to get back is Usenet News. tin, trn, rn etc I all have a lot of muscle memory for, and by running netnews inside a closed network of other relatively trusted sites you have some hope of scaling the whole thing without needing to bust out into the swamp of the wild, wild Internet of netnews.
There&#39;s tin, ready to be compiled when you are.</description>

      <description>Just a list, so I can&#39;t forget who I saw on a very good trip to Chicago last week.
 Megabus. Cheap and cheerful transportation, very convenient to where I was going, good drivers both ways. The return trip bus was kind of old (e.g. the power outlets didn&#39;t work) but the driver was fantastic. HI-Chicago a hostel in the loop. Cheap and cheerful lodging, very convenient. Eric Sinclair and Anne Zender.</description>

Fun with server-side includes, learning about the Meta refresh hack, and the XBitHack.
I&#39;m using screen to manage multiple shells on the same terminal. it seems to work nicely under mosh. In the process of doing so I managed to strand a bunch of mosh shells, which I&#39;m going to clean up.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m playing on tilde.club/~emv.
It&#39;s interesting and fun to try to write a weblog when you don&#39;t have any content management system other than the Unix shell, but at some point quickly you end up moving a file on top of another file and wiping out a bunch of work, and then it gets less fun.
What I think I want to do there is write in Markdown, but somehow assemble bits of Markdown into what ends up looking like an old fashioned blog, with a sidebar that&#39;s interesting and ever-changing and a main blog part that&#39;s one post per day.</description>

http://www.ridescoutapp.com/
It&#39;s the first independent app that I&#39;ve seen that shows where every AAATA stop is, in a nice little app that works on your phone with a zippy little map that scrolls nicely.</description>

&#34;ssh new@sdf.org&#34; and you can set yourself up a shell account with a gopher client installed and gopher server space available.</description>

I stayed here for the eChicago conference in an 8-person room; this time I upgraded to the 4-person room. Two nights stay is less than $100, which is hard to beat.</description>

      <description>Some very nice postcards indeed from their postcard rack, at about $1 a piece. I&#39;m going to study them closely and them mail them off!</description>

      <description>One of the tools that I rediscovered and have been really happy for having done so is &amp;ldquo;jq&amp;rdquo;, a command line tool that bills itself as &amp;ldquo;awk for json&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing awk code since 1985, and some limited subset of it is something that I know really, really well. awk, however, is from the punchcard era, and as such it likes to deal with records that are all on one line each.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m working on a tool or a set of tools to assist people in finding grave sites in the Park Cemetery in Marquette, Michigan as a part of a project for Code Michigan. I&#39;m working with a team that&#39;s based in the U.P. to do this, and we&#39;re collaborating over Google Hangouts. Code Michigan is a hackathon, so this project timeline is compressed to a single weekend. The team is Edward Vielmetti, Jim Argeropoulos, Chris Marr, and Lynn Czarnecki Makela.</description>

      <description>Throwing out some notes here for a panel I&#39;m on at the #micities conference at the Michigan Union today October 4, 2014.
The questions are around open data, considered as data published by a government agency that has a
 well defined data format (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML documented API, etc) well defined access path via Internet (HTTP, FTP, API) well defined terms of use and reuse  Census data is perhaps the most openly open of open data.</description>

      <description>I found the Chicago Postcard Museum which is all online; pity that it&#39;s not in a real place or I&#39;d visit.
Where would you go in the Loop to get good and interesting cards? I&#39;m not interested in spending lots of money per card, but I would like to have a nice variety to choose from.</description>

      <description>The internet of things is a multi-protocol internet, with lots of legacy protocols in use as well as homemade protocols over TCP/IP and also serial port stuff and funky radio uses. Oh, and HTTP too.
Some of the things in the internet of things are very small and have very low cost network capacity, which rules out using a full stack HTTP implementation. Others are not quite as small, but still don&#39;t have enough oomph to take on an Internet&#39;s worth of traffic, so you might run HTTP but still keep the devices firewalled very carefully from the Internet.</description>

      <description>The Dallas-Fort Worth area was hit by severe storms the evening of October 2, 2014. The Dallas Morning News live blog details the impact, with more than 250,000 people without power.
This outage map from about 7:00 p.m. that evening shows the extent of the damage.

My power outage tracker page is a good early warning of problems with the power grid. By looking at what web pages people are clicking through on, I can see where the troubles are.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I&#39;ve added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I&#39;ve closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github&#39;s issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking.</description>

      <description>Editorial debt accumulates when the passage of time makes a document less true, to the point where the written word has to be edited to keep it up to date or scrapped because the work is uselessly outdated.
For fast-moving stories, the first edit will be wrong in many ways. There will be missing facts, incomplete images, and gaps in the narrative. This is short term editorial debt, which can be addressed once the immediate crisis has played itself out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&amp;#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a 750 word essay every day.
I know that it&amp;#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&amp;#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone.</description>

      <title>A design for heat maps of parking system congestion</title>

      <description>The unit of analysis is the parking structure. It has a capacity c, and a usage u(t) for any time t observed.
If u/c &amp;gt; 0.8 the structure is congested; at u/c &amp;gt; 0.9 the structure is full. That reduces the time series of usage for a given structure into one of three values (green, yellow, red). Some public policy goal wants to keep the structures congested (to maximize revenues) but not full (to minimize complaints).</description>

      <description>This map, from an MDOT study of US-23 traffic congestion mitigation alternatives, is a very nice view of just how busy and how slow US-23 north of Ann Arbor is on a typical weekday. This image was pulled from the AAATA board packet for September 25, 2014, as published as a2docs 386.
Other agencies looking to make a case for capacity improvements can refer to this clear graphic as a way of describing just exactly what&amp;#39;s going on and when and where.</description>

      <description>How do you organize materials such that they don&#39;t get lost, so that they stay reasonably up to date, and so they work the way your mind expects them to? Wiki and weblogs have been one of my answers, but even with that it&#39;s hard to wiki and weblog hard enough to keep up with the world.
I&#39;m noticing this especially with the contacts database on my computer. With nominally thousands of names there, I&#39;d have to update more than a dozen names a day simply to say that I was current within the span of a year.</description>

How does a Chromecast work? See Tom&#39;s Guide for a primer. I was sold on the idea because it let me cast my Android&#39;s screen to a big monitor without any fuss of cables and wires. Genius!</description>

In order of appearance:
Chrome, first thing. I like Safari enough in a pinch, but when it comes time to sync up my working environment, Chrome is what I need. A bonus on this system is that there&#39;s a working full-screen mode.</description>

      <description>Github is not much fun on a very small screen.
Octodroid does a competent job of letting you add comments to issues and scrolling through issues. It isn&#39;t so wonderful if you have gone to some trouble to categorize issues by milestone.
None of the github Android clients I have give any access to the github wiki.
Mostly the difficult part is that I had a well worked out workflow that moved open issues or if my inbox and into github, and the small screen simply does not make that a smooth process.</description>

      <description>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media&#39;s coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it&#39;s an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived.</description>

      <description>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can&#39;t, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.
For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose.</description>

      <description>Pete Kaminski pointed me to this essay on archetypes in computer gaming, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.
What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t see an &#34;export all my work here&#34; button on ello, the new trendy social network. So I am unlikely to put anything there that I am unwilling to have destroyed on a moment&#39;s notice.</description>

      <description>The tone of Michigan football blogs has changed since the loss to Minnesota on Saturday. Before the game there was a lot of grumbling, but it was varied; no one single issue stood out. After the game, it was much more clear.
A series of plays saw the second string Michigan quarterback, Shane Morris, get hit hard on his head. Morris is seen exhibiting signs of a concussion. Yet in an unfortunate sequence he goes back into the game after sitting out one play on the sidelines.</description>

      <description>The revolution will not be blogged. It will be twittered or facebooked or elloed or plurked, but blogging is not a revolutionary activity in the new era of the net.
The process of writing for your own web site and then announcing that you have something new to say to the world is perhaps the least efficient way of getting news to the world. It is so much easier and more efficient to drop that news inside a walled garden of publishing and have it ricochet quickly inside the walls.</description>

      <description>At some point in the life of a project it is inevitable that an obstacle comes up that makes you wonder whether your enthusiasm for the effort is well placed.
Do you redouble your efforts, or do you take a break, or do you simply refocus and find something else to zero in on for the moment?
Sometimes a bit of distance can help, at least temporarily. Rather than exit in flames with a tattered manifesto flapping on the door in your wake, just go quiet for a while.</description>

      <description>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once, and it stuck.
A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on.</description>

      <description>Some notes from the table at the People&#39;s Food Co-op.
My Saturday routine is to go to the farmer&#39;s market and to the food co-op. I have been doing this for a long time, more than a decade at least. When the boys were smaller they always came along, but now I head out solo.
There is a small cadre of folks who I know from town and from Twitter who also have the same habit, and we compare notes on line as to what is at market.</description>

      <description>What is Wikipedia for? It&#39;s for bots.
This machine kills trolls: How Wikipedia’s robots and cyborgs snuff out vandalism writes up the work of the Wikipedia contributors who have written robots (bots) that automatically extirpate contributions to the encyclopedia that are unwanted.
Alas, the result of all of this highly efficient robot-driven editing is that many new editors first interaction with the system is not with a human being, but with a faceless robot.</description>

      <description>How do you produce so much writing? It is simple. All you have to do is sit down every single day and write.
There is nothing like a daily deadline to focus the mind.
Weblogs do not impose an external deadline. No editor is asking you when your work is going to be ready, and no producer is going to feed you copy. It is just you up against the elements, bravely typing away alone and hoping that your focus is not distracted by systems problems.</description>

      <description>Did I just complain about address books? Well let me complain again.
My addressbook asks for a random() function. It needs to surprise me from time to time, showing me individuals who aren&#39;t going to show up in a search, but who nonetheless are worthy of remembering right now.
My addressbook needs a search by location function, so that I can pan and zoom over geography and figure out who I know where and who&#39;s nearby enough but not in the same city.</description>

      <description>My address book fails me, in that it does not have any same way to encode the best way to reach someone.
Should I just call? Is it best to confirm that you are not busy now? Do you so instant message, Twitter DM, some other single purpose system that you are always available on? Should I revert to email to schedule something for later?
It is always appropriate to send a postcard, but I have not figured out how to make that an instant process, not that it really wants to be.</description>

      <description>I am operating with the limitation that I do not currently have a full sized keyboard and screen. The laptop accidentally ingested a cup of coffee. It is getting dried out and the bad bits reclaimed now, and in the meantime I am doing all my computing on either library computers or my Nexus 4 phone.
It is often awkward to compose messages and to write on such a small screen, but the screen size is not really the problem.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a design for a low overhead way to post about events coming up in Ann Arbor. Follow @a2events on Twitter if you want to play along.
The first rule of business is that every event has to have a URL, and the more simple and direct the URL is the more likely it is that it&#39;s authoritative for the event. If an event doesn&#39;t have a URL yet, I&#39;ll blog about it here if I need to post about it.</description>

      <description>I wrote up a piece about how you might rewrite your resume to provide a &#34;retcon&#34; (&#34;retroactive continuity&#34;) treatment, which emphasizes reinterpreting past events in such a way that they look like part of a story with a narrative arc.
That got me to thinking about lunch, of course, and the little hoary old story I tell about when the a2b3 group started &#34;8 years ago&#34;. And I realize now that I can trace back continuity way longer than that.</description>

      <description>So you&#39;re writing a resume or a CV or a biographical sketch. What do you need to say to make you into a superhero with a fantastic back story that hints at your future greatness?
Retcon comes from &#34;retroactive continuity&#34;, a plot device first used in comic books. See Urban Dictionary for a fun definition.
I have a sneaking suspicion that once I go back far enough and create some retroactive continuity that I&#39;ll be able to describe my life as a set of 30-year projects, many of which are already in progress and that run in parallel and not just one after the other.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor District Library is really quite good about getting copies of new books for its bookshelves. You can request a title online, and very few reasonable requests for in-print materials available from publishers are turned down. (I haven&#39;t tried the equivalent for self-published books, but I suspect it&#39;s harder; that would be a good question.)
Alas, requesting a book does not immediately add you to the request list for the book, so you need to keep a task alive to search for the title or author in the hopes that it shows up soon enough (with &#34;</description>

      <description>The challenge I put to myself is to spend not more than $100 and get a functioning solar powered charging station. The alternate name is a &#34;camping power supply&#34; for off-the-grid operations.
Breaking down the components it looks like this would be a combination of the following:
Solar panel. Estimate as a start that you want to generate 40 watts of power at peak times, using a panel that&#39;s small enough and portable enough that you can move it to where there&#39;s the best sun, but not necessarily so portable that you&#39;re carrying it with you in your backpack.</description>

      <description>Every Thursday at the a2b3 lunch, we talk about upcoming events for the next week and month and season for the Ann Arbor area. It&#39;s a good way to hear about what&#39;s coming up, and to hear from people who are organizing events in the future who need help now for planning and gaining support.
I&#39;ve been unburdening my inbox of events notices by sending them out to Twitter. It strikes me that I could almost as easily do that here in this weblog, since there&#39;s an &#34;</description>

      <description>Essential components of Ann Arbor Weather Twitter:
In an emergency, call 911.
911 trunk lines can go down in storms. The Ann Arbor non-emergency police number is (734) 994-2911, put it in your cell phone.
Sirens: City sirens are tested on the second Tuesdays of the month at 1 pm. A small handful of us notice this and tweet SIRENS. Generally siren activation in any quantity will prompt twitter chatter. Hashtags: #miwx is primary, but I also watch or post to #annarbor and #skywarn.</description>

      <description>Discardia is a quarterly holiday that helps you get rid of things. This year&#39;s fall season dates are September 22 (the equinox) to September 23 (the new moon), 2014. I&#39;m looking forward at the very least to a cleanout of the basement, which as my son points out is full of &#39;crap from the 1990s&#39;.
See www.discardia.com for details; the origin of the event is due to Dinah Sanders.</description>

Of the many facets of the criminal world, few have captured society’s fascination as has that of high stakes robbery. The combination of meticulousness, cunning, and audacity required to execute a real-life Ocean’s Eleven may be uncommon among criminals, but fortunately it is common enough to extract a wealth of lessons for the protection of high-value assets.</description>

      <description>I have written about here previously about Stanford researcher BJ Fogg in the context of his &#34;Tiny Habits&#34; project. He has a talk here from 2012 about the &#34;motivation wave&#34; and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low.</description>

      <description>I visit Marquette Michigan every summer to see family and catch up with friends and visit the place I went to high school. Every so often there&#39;s a reunion, but often it&#39;s just a matter of going back to the home town and figuring out what&#39;s up and what&#39;s what.
Since I&#39;ve been working on Arborwiki for the better part of eight years, I thought last year that I&#39;d give a try to make a Localwiki for Marquette.</description>

      <description>The St Louis, Missouri Localwiki - http://localwiki.net/st-louis - was mostly empty when the events in Ferguson, MO started on August 9, 2014 with the death of 18 year old student Michael Brown. As with any event where there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s going on in an unfamiliar area, I was drawn to making some sense of what was happening. This has been especially true when the coverage on the #ferguson hashtag overwhelmed my Twitter feed, which had been usually quiet at night.</description>

If you have written something that&#39;s quotable about any of the candidates, or if you have something to add yourself, please let me know!</description>

The Chronicle was noted for its relentless and exhausting coverage of civic meetings. You could get the feeling that you too had sat on the hard benches for hours as you read through a 15,000 word account of what transpired.</description>

      <description>Avoid the long lines and sit down quickly with these tips at Zingerman&#39;s Deli.
 Go to the bread counter in the deli. After you taste the samples, get a bagel. Ask them to slice it. (Or ask for one of their yummy bialys which I did last time I was there.)
 Proceed to the deli counter or the fish counter, if you&#39;re hungry for same. Ask for something you&#39;d like to put on that bagel.</description>

      <description>This map from LightningMaps.ORG shows lightning over Lake Michigan and into Ottawa County, Michigan at about 11:15 p.m on 22 July 2014. Note the strong line of storms crossing the lake.

The corresponding power outage map is from Consumers Energy. Outage reporting generally lags behind realtime by 15-30 minutes, and of course not every lightning strike turns into a power problem (though sometimes it seems like it does).
Ottawa County, Michigan radio feeds are available on Broadcastify.</description>

      <description>In Michigan, February is 13 months long. That&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking of simulated sunrise applications that turn a pleasant light on slowly to mimic the sunrise. I don&#39;t need this in July, but I will need it come February.
If you&#39;ve tried one of these things let me know, I&#39;ll fill in the blank space here with more information as I get it.

&amp;mdash; Sumpy McPumperton (@GregsSumpPump) July 1, 2014 
ANN ARBOR, July 1, 2014: The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission is considering the Glendale Condominiums, a proposed development at 312 Glendale Place. Neighbors came out in force to oppose the development, citing among other things the impact that the proposed new impervious surface would exacerbate the existing flooding events that have affected the nearby neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>The single most popular page on this web site is the power outage tracking map collection page. It has static copies of samples of power outage maps from utilities around the country, and it gets bunches of hits every single time there&#39;s bad weather - to the extent that I can pretty much tell where there&#39;s bad weather by the outbound clicks on the page.
The page, however, is not fed with live data; it only has static instances of previous maps.</description>

      <description>I have found myself thinking about things, and how to connect things to the net, quite a bit recently. I&#39;ll be blogging more about it here and elsewhere.
By &#34;things&#34; I mean more precisely devices at the edge of the network that are not on the network in the usual way. You can&#39;t connect to them directly, but they can send and receive messages via sensors and actuators that figure out what they are doing and instruct them what to do.</description>

It&#39;s maintained by Lawrence Yau (sirlagz), and the 2.5 version is based on Debian &#34;Jessie&#34;. Forthwith: Raspbian Server Edition.</description>

I decided a few weeks ago to become a member, so that I&#39;d have a workshop that was well stocked with equipment and so that I could start working on projects in a place that not only had cool stuff but also that had smart people and was convenient to downtown.</description>

What do you do with the Internet of Cats? You have a cat with a collar, and some number of grams of electronics that can be affixed to the collar. What kind of interesting internet stuff can go there?
So far I&#39;ve found the StickNFind, which is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon with a key fob attachment and some pictures of cats wearing it as a tag.</description>

      <description>I was productive this morning, cranking out about 1500 words in the span of a couple of hours without much in the way of distractions. It was a timely day to be productive, and the morning&#39;s activity resulted in a further productive afternoon meeting. It was a good day. (Not every day is always a good day for writing.)
How do I get away from distractions? The key was to find an unusual place in this world: a location with good enough coffee, enough power outlets, broken wifi and no cell service.</description>

      <description>Did you ever wake up from a long session online and discover that you had very little to show for it? There&#39;s a pattern of internet use that&#39;s simple and very disturbingly unproductive. Go to you favorite network, read everything, get bored when the refresh doesn&#39;t produce anything new. Switch networks, repeat. When you&#39;ve visited everything, go back to the first one and hope that there&#39;s something new.
It&#39;s a wonderful way to consume content, and since you&#39;re always looking at new things it&#39;s a way to perpetually be entertained by novelty.</description>

      <description>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here&#39;s a latest try.
There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban: 1. Visualize your work 2. Limit your work-in-progress
I wrote about Personal Kanban before back in 2010, but I didn&#39;t try to put it into practice as such.
Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There&#39;s a review of Boardthing from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it&#39;s a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board.</description>

All of the old Arborwiki URLs still work; you can get to the home page at http://localwiki.net/ann-arbor or at http://arborwiki.org . We fixed a temporary problem where old URLs with a /city/ prefix stopped working.</description>

      <description>A map from the James River Association in Virginia shows the problem: the water intake for the city of Richmond, Virginia is on the James River, downstream from a crude oil spill in Lynchburg, Virginia.

From the Richmond Times-Dispatch -
 No one was killed or injured when more than a dozen CSX tanker cars derailed on Wednesday afternoon, but the resulting fire and spill prompted City Manager Kimball Payne to declare an emergency and temporarily evacuate part of downtown.</description>

      <description>After getting one too many political ads in my Facebook newsfeed, I started paying closer attention to the &#34;Paid for by&#34; language that I expect to see on every paid political campaign message. The mayoral candidates for the City of Ann Arbor all have some work ahead of them to get their disclosures in order for the 2014 campaign.
I looked for campaign disclosures on Facebook pages, on Twitter feeds, and on event pages created by the campaign on Facebook.</description>

      <description>In my case, that means in part going through my inbox with a sharp eye and saying &#34;can I unsubscribe from this?&#34; I was astounded to figure out just how many times I was able to say &#34;yes&#34; to that question. The hope is that the inbox gets a little bit less cluttered.
I&#39;m sure some marketing department got a little bit sad. Every unsubscribe routine is a little bit different, but the usual drill ends with a plaintive &#34;</description>

      <description>This eulogy was read for my great-uncle Alfio (Auch) by his nephew Zorba. Alfio Vielmetti died in 2008 at the age of 96. I think of him when I am out on my walks, and I miss him when I wish I had someone like him to talk to about city council.
AUCH
My uncle Alfio lived a life centered on family and community, with lessons learned hard in early years, and applied for a very long lifetime.</description>

      <description>A dam broke in Roscommon County Michigan, flooding a downstream creek and washing out roads. I am on the lookout for a map of the area, because I know that dried out flooded lands often yield good mushroom hunting.
Some news articles:
UPDATE: Roscommon Co. Dam Failure Impacts Clare Co. Roads, 9 and 10 News
 As of noon on Tuesday, the Wraco Lodge Dam along Wolf Creek has given way and high waters are moving downstream toward Old 27 and US-127.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve unsubscribed from a local politics mailing list that I&#39;ve been on for a while. Out of an abundance of not wanting to name names, I&#39;m not naming names; chances are there&#39;s one of these in your community too.
The ground rules of this list are almost certainly that of typical politics lists. There&#39;s a list owner, who sets the rules. One of the rules is that the list is a private list, with no reporters on it and no one is supposed to share anything they get from the list to anyone who&#39;s not on the list.</description>

      <description>Getting things done includes deciding what not to do. In my case, it&#39;s a matter of going through my todo list and striking off the well-intentioned tasks from two or three months ago that took a moment to write and that would take hours to complete.
I&#39;m better off at accomplishing things when there are fewer undone things to choose from.

 Whoop whoop! A very tech-savvy Juggalo by the name of Papa Nutt has taken it upon himself to create a cryptocurrency specifically for Faygo-chugging devotees of &#34;the Family&#34; to buy goods and services with*, especially at the upcoming Gathering of the Juggalos.</description>

      <description>The story is Local News, Off College Presses, from April 13, 2014.
 The constant changes have muddled The Ann Arbor News’s identity and, according to some residents, eroded its standing as the go-to source of news in the community. That sense was reinforced by the football article, on which The Ann Arbor News played catch-up after student reporters broke the story.
 Poynter noted in 2011 that the University of Michigan had placed a member of its PR staff on the AnnArbor.</description>

 Starting this weekend, the Chicago Sun-Times and the other titles in the Sun-Times Media group will temporarily cease to run comments with our articles.
 Why? If you&#39;ve read newspaper comments, you&#39;ll know why already: they are awful.

      <description>Facebook is changing; in this particualr case it&#39;s a reorganization of the messaging functions into their own app. From Techcrunch, the predictable cries of frustration from people who are used to what they have.
 Still, a unilateral forced migration is the exact kind of change Facebook users hate, and this will only breed more paranoia that their social network could change without their consent. Taking a slower “We’re switching everyone eventually, so you might as well do it now” approach might have gone over better than “Your familiar chat interface will be destroyed in two weeks whether you like it or not”.</description>

      <description>Every day, read the email. Answer, as best you can, yesterday&#39;s email. The yesterbox technique helps out, though it&#39;s not perfect.
Follow interesting people on Twitter, but not too many interesting people. Manage the tricky relationship of &#34;friending&#34; people on Facebook, knowing full well once you have befriended someone it&#39;s a huge social transgression to unfriend them, even if you don&#39;t care for their particular brand of cat videos or politics.</description>

      <description>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game &#34;2048&#34;. (No, I won&#39;t link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating 2048 5D I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. 5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it.</description>

KE4KMD maintains a similar list, which was used in part to develop this one. There is a national Skywarn directory at Skywarn.org.
This list is sorted by state, and from there grouped regionally by National Weather Service forecast office directory. In some cases, NWS forecast areas cross state boundaries, and those are noted.</description>

      <description>Developed in 2008 by Brian Solis, The [Conversation Prism] is a visual map of the social media landscape. It’s an ongoing study in digital ethnography that tracks dominant and promising social networks and organizes them by how they’re used in everyday life.
In 2009, I wrote up how the a2b3 lunch organizes itself through the eye of the this system. I ran across it again, and decided to do a repeat.</description>

 When did you get the idea to do an a2parking application, and how long did it take you to go from idea to first version?  In October or November 2011 I was looking at the a2dda website and happened to see the parking space availability on one of the pages.</description>

Metalworkers, inventors, papermakers, artists, students, robot designers, enthusiasts and professional alike teach the public how they make their work. Many participants come away with more than just inspiration, but new skills they can use to fuel their own creations and lasting connections to other makers and resources in the region.</description>

      <description>&#34;a2 parking&#34; is an Android application that provides real time updates of available parking spaces in Ann Arbor parking structures. It is based on data published on the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority web site, and in addition to showing spaces free in structures it has one-touch access to directions to your favorite lot or structure.
Download from Google Play: a2 parking.
This has been a long time coming; an interview with Steve Smith of Republic Parking in 2008 described the basic outlines of this data.</description>

      <description>From Facebook and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum:
Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan.
This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no &#34;stay&#34; pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately.
Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so.</description>

      <description>The weekly a2b3 lunch met at Madras Masala on this the third Thursday of March. It&#39;s been our habit to meet at Madras on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays. The dining room is large and could seat a large party, but our typical lunch has rarely less than 6 and rarely more than 8 people there, which is just about perfect.
This week&#39;s tally was 6, which is just barely big enough to justify a formal round of introductions, but we did it anyway.</description>

      <description>This wide-ranging talk uses the current state of cryptocurrencies (most notably Bitcoin) and their underlying technologies to consider contemporary digital culture and its future. Professor Finn Brunton will discuss peer-to-peer networks, public key cryptography, proof-of-work systems, and the blockchain, illuminating their underlying social, political, and theoretical models and concepts. We will travel from sixth century Chang&#39;an, seventeenth century Switzerland, and the vault of the New York Federal Reserve to IRC channels, software development communities, and closely guarded facilities in Iceland and Hong Kong to understand a system with fascinating implications for identity, ownership, authorship and trust online.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the new comment stream into Disqus.</description>

The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of the &#34;blockquote&#34; font size and weight:
 Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I&#39;d prefer to make it quite a bit less bold since I don&#39;t use it so much.</description>

Get the whole album, Calligraphy, at Bandcamp.
 Papillon (a.k.a. the PeanutButterFly) is a Caribbean American poet and song-writer from Paris, France. Raised with a very culturally diverse environment and brought up in a world of entertainment, this multi-media artist has been an actor and musician since the early age of 12. After a first solo album called “the Amber Dawn” he is returning to the stage with the double album “Calligraphy”.</description>

      <description>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and book-buying habits show a schism between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you&#39;d think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.
Wayne Baker&#39;s new book United America looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum.</description>

      <description>In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a container holding radioactive materials was reported to be leaking after it was dropped. Subsequent investigation showed that there was no contamination and there were no injuries reported.
Some sources
Chronicle Herald -  Later, the Halifax Fire Department confirmed that four cylanders containing uranium hexafluoride fell from a container, but there was no leak of radioactive material. The fire department also said no one had been injured or contaminated as a result of the incident.</description>

      <description>The challenge of being an expert is that it is hard to be one in your own home town.
Expertise is valued when it comes from far away. The traveling scholar is special for their pure understanding of a difficult field, and they don&amp;rsquo;t incur the baggage of being a neighbor or even a friend. The distinguished visitor can be an exemplar of their craft, not distracted by any complicated local entanglements.</description>

      <description>I was up late the other night when the news that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was missing came out. There was a flurry of speculation as to its whereabouts, but no hard news. I went to bed figuring that by morning the mystery would be resolved.
That was four days ago, and the plane is still missing and the mystery has only deepened. Short of going on a search and rescue mission yourself, the closest that anyone can do to chip in on the search is to join in on Tomnod which has a crowd-sourced digital image recognition system.</description>

 Daylight saving time. It&#39;s now light what seems like late into the evening, and it&#39;s only going to get lighter later from now on through mid summer. Snowdrops. Spotted yesterday (before the snow) at the sunny side of our house. Festifools is only a few weeks away.</description>

Every year the nerd bird flies hundreds of people from San Francisco to Austin (and to be fair other airplanes fly other people from other places to Austin). There&#39;s a good solid week of product demos, parties, music, film, etc. It sounds like fun, and I&#39;ve never gone. I&#39;m wondering what my alternate history would have been if I would have been a regular there - who would I know that I don&#39;t know now, what connections I&#39;d make, etc.</description>

      <description>A review of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.
Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people&#39;s cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas.</description>

He served in the Philippines on General MacArthur&#39;s staff during the war. After the war, Mr. Doyle returned to Ann Arbor where after the passing of his parents, he spent the majority of his adult life taking care of his younger brother who was severely disabled.</description>

      <description>Meetup.com has had a series of bad days. Their site has been under a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for a number of days. To mitigate the problem, they are using the CloudFlare service, but even that has not been working great.
The net effect is that sometimes the Meetup.com site is unavailable, making it hard to sign up or schedule or reschedule events. The Meetup periodic announcements about the problem emphasize how hard they are working to fix it and how user credit cards are not at risk.</description>

This week the food was at Taco King (yummy) and the question was about new apps for people&#39;s phones that they added, or apps that they uninstalled. It was a good way to get some insight into the new parts of the net that are explored only through apps.</description>

 The website of Mt. Gox suddenly went dark on Tuesday with no explanation, and the company&#39;s Tokyo office was empty - the only activity was outside, where a handful of protesters said they had lost money investing in the virtual currency.</description>

      <description>Apple devices are subject to a bug in a core crypto library where one line of errant code - the self-describing bug &#34;goto fail;&#34; - causes SSL connections to be untrustworthy.
IOS systems have a patch (and you should upgrade now); we&#39;re waiting for the OS X hotfix.
Some good analysis on Twitter of late, and this article on Wired: Behind iPhone’s Critical Security Bug, a Single Bad ‘Goto’ -  Apple released iOS 7.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m trying out Slack. Here are some first impressions.
The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks. For the ubergeeks, it also has a very competent IRC client support.</description>

      <description>Sawnee EMC has a recently new power outage map, including a map optimized for mobile access. The press release they issued back in November 2013 has a lot more details.
Sawnee EMC serves electrical customers in portions of Forsyth, Fulton, Dawson, Lumpkin, Cherokee, Hall, &amp;amp; Gwinnett counties, in an area north of Atlanta, Georgia.

The Atlanta area is expecting severe weather and ice the week of February 12, 2014, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</description>

      <description>Depending on the source you get a slightly different story, but the results are the same: there is a lot of volatility in Bitcoin pricing in early February 2014 because of problems at the Mt. Gox exchange. So much for a technologically pristine, mathematically pure, decentralized currency; when your &#34;foreign exchange&#34; depends on a very small number of businesses, it can have systematic vulnerabilities.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.

I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected.</description>

      <description>Because it&#39;s that time of year when sidewalks are full of snow and ice.
4:60. Snow and ice. All snow and ice which has accumulated prior to 6:00 a.m. on a public sidewalk adjacent to property not zoned residentially shall be removed by the owner or occupant by noon. Immediately after the accumulation of ice on such sidewalk it shall be treated with sand, salt or other substance to prevent it from being slippery and the ice shall be removed within the time limits of this paragraph.</description>

      <description>I&#39;d like to do some long form writing, except that I&#39;d publish it on Twitter. I&#39;ll write essays as I&#39;d normally write them, making sure that sentences are 140 characters or less. The goal would be to encapsulate an entire argument in pithy sentences and make each one stand on its own. I have no doubt that it would be possible to write quite a few words this way, though you might lose some followers in the bargain.</description>

      <description>February 5, 2014: More than 623,000 customers were without power in the service area covered by PECO (Philadelphia, PA area) at the peak of an ice storm on Wednesday. This is the second worst storm that the company has reported, right behind Hurricane Sandy.

The PECO power outage map does not go into lots of detail on the map, but it does list individual communities and their outage status in county by county detail pages.</description>

Thanks to Cameron Kaiser for running the Floodgap gopher gateway that provides web access to venerable (and new) Gopherspace resources.</description>

      <description>Does email work anymore as a way to connect people who share the same interests, in the old-school Internet sense of the community that forms around a well-managed, well-moderated mailing list? I&#39;m starting to think after having my inbox fill up with well-intentioned communications that the era of the mailing list is over, and with it the era of any other use for email except the purely transactional.
My email messages are relatively long (compared to IMs or tweets), relatively formal, and carefully composed.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I&#39;d give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.

      <description>It&#39;s cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.

From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
 It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it&#39;s easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.
So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya&#39;s &#34;How to Solve It&#34; (1945), David Sucher&#39;s &#34;City Comforts&#34; (2003), and Michael Benedikt&#39;s anthology &#34;Cyberspace: First Steps&#34;</description>

      <description>I&#39;m (still) using OneTab to keep control of my tabs in Chrome. I wrote about it previously; it&#39;s an extension that suspends the processes of tabs you mark as inactive, so that they can be restored quickly. As a bonus, it&#39;s good at keeping things out of working memory, so you can have a system with &#34;only&#34; 2 gigabytes and still run Chrome without endless swapping.
The Internet, in its infinite wisdom, has a lot of things competing for our attention.</description>

      <description>On the morning of 27 January 2014, AT&amp;amp;T UVerse services appear to be suffering from DNS problems. A graph from Down Detector suggests that the problem is widespread. The observation is that some sites will load but others won&#39;t (like Hulu, New Yorker, Reddit.)

One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8). On my Mac, go to System Preferences  Network  Advanced .</description>

      <description>There are lots of reasons to want to use more art on this weblog. It&#39;s attractive, for one; it displays good taste to have interesting artwork to illustrate your points; and the reader who is tuned to the visual image has a lot more likelihood to appreciate a crisp image than they will a wall of text. That&#39;s all good.
I also am very aware that in most cases the works that I&#39;d like to share references to are copyrighted, and in some cases (looking at you, Getty Images) the copyright holders have been aggressive in pursuing their digital rights.</description>

      <description>ABC News reports:
 Metro-North, the nation&#39;s second-busiest commuter railroad, was brought to a standstill for nearly two hours on Thursday night after computer problems caused signal issues system-wide, railroad officials said.
 CBS has this diagnosis of what went wrong, and why
 The cause of the outage remained under investigation Thursday night. “We can’t say what the cause of it is. We’re still trying to figure that out,” Daniels told 1010 WINS.</description>

      <description>MGoBlog has a tremendously entertaining and informative guide to handicapping the race to replace Mary Sue Coleman as University of Michigan president. The article calls out the University of Virginia&#39;s Teresa Sullivan (ex UM provost), Oberlin&#39;s Marvin Krislov (ex UM general counsel), and Rutgers&#39;s Nancy Cantor (ex UM provost) as the top three picks. Of the three Cantor seems to be least likely, since she just took a position at Rutgers in January 2014 having left Syracuse.</description>

      <description>Via Youtube, here&#39;s the last 4 minutes or so of a broadcast of the Tigers-Yankees game in June 1976 where Mark Fidrych throws a complete game win. 
Interested in more Tigers lore? I found the Mayo Smith Society on Facebook which is always good for Detroit Tigers stories.</description>

      <description>To the Editor: The question has been asked your correspondent by several citizens: Can the city legally compel the owners or occupants of property in this city to construct, at their own expense, sidewalks in front of their premises? The city certainly claims ownership of the street from fence to fence, and exercises absolute control thereof. Even if a man desires to plant shade trees on the street in front of his property, the city prescribes the exact distance at which they shall be placed from the property owner&#39;s street line; and notwithstanding the fact that the property owner pays for the trees himself and also for the planting and subsequent care of them until their growth is assured, yet he is denied by the city any ownership in them, and is forbidden to remove or even to trim them, should he at any time desire to do so.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while, I come up with a really good idea. More often than not, I don&#39;t.
I&#39;m content to work on systems that accommodate the work that leads to a steady sense of slow progress. The weblog piles one post upon another; every so often, the middle of the pile is most interesting, and you dust it off and bring it out again as if it were new.</description>

      <description>I have a bunch of tools that tell me what people have looked at on the net, including Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Clicky, and some Twitter tools. It&#39;s fascinating to see people&#39;s attention move around and occasionally reanimate something that I wrote months or years ago.
What these tools don&#39;t easily do is tell me what to write about next. Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using a todo system based on Github issues for the better part of a year. It&#39;s been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren&#39;t done yet but that need to be.
When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to &#34;do laundry&#34; (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</description>

      <description>A chemical spill of crude MCHM into the Elk River near Charleston, WV on January 9, 2014 has contaminated the tap water for 300,000 customers of West Virginia American Water. The chemical was stored in tanks owned by Freedom Industries. Crude MCHM (MSDS, Eastman Chemical) is a mixture of several chemicals, including 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol, 4- (methoxymethyl)cyclohexanemethanol, methyl 4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate, dimethyl 1,4- cyclohexanedicarboxylate, methanol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; it is used in the coal processing industry to produce &#34;</description>

      <description>The world of power outage maps is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There&#39;s no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan&#39;s BWL, don&#39;t have maps, making customer communication difficult.
If you can&#39;t map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s bitter cold in the Ann Arbor area and throughout the country; temperatures have been below zero most of the last two days. One of the things we&#39;re looking for a silver lining in super cold weather is its impact on bugs, especially invasive species like the emerald ash borer that are not used to unusual weather. A story in the The Gazette (Cedar Rapids Iowa) has a description of the effects of extreme cold on these destructive beetles.</description>

      <description>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours).</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It&#39;s hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today&#39;s email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday&#39;s mail you are really done.
The slight complication for this system for me is that I&#39;m also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do.</description>

 FYI: I discussed this issue with the Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council and options were discussed. County government has been mobilized to do our part to ensure that members of our community that are homeless are able to keep warm over the next few days.</description>

Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a &#34;Snow Condition Yellow&#34;. From the City of Ann Arbor Facebook:
 The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets.</description>

Hoppin&#39; Giovanni Wash and chop a bunch of rapini (broccoli rabe). If you can&#39;t find rapini, some other mild green like turnip greens (or even kale) would work nicely.

      <description>Kai Petainen writes that the downtown &#34;Library Lot&#34; parking structure so full on New Years Eve that when everyone went to leave it at once, the lines were so long that people&#39;s paid tickets ran out of time. This caused additional delays of up to 45 minutes on exit and confusion as people had to turn around to re-pay.
I have heard of previous times where other unattended structures (notably Liberty Square) have had similar problems with the prepaid ticket system in busy events.</description>

      <description>December 30, 31 2013: Two BNSF trains collided about a mile west of Casselton, North Dakota, setting the crude oil that one of them was carrying on fire. The toxic plume of smoke from the fire has led to evacuations of the city, which is 25 miles west of Fargo. The fire&#39;s black smoke is visible from space, as seen in the GOES satellite image below.

 Meteorologist Aaron White: The smoke plume from the train collision was large enough that it could be seen on the visible satellite imagery just before sunset.</description>

      <description>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy of something I&#39;ve already written and published somewhere else. That ensures that in some way I&#39;ll be able to find it, probably by googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into the ether too quickly (including this thread which will die quietly when we are all done with it).
Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don&#39;t really provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic discussion.</description>

      <description>The ice storm of late December 2013 hit the Lansing area hard, and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting outages as well as citizens would have them do. The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL, the Lansing Board of Water and Light. Even though the surrounding area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing, LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively unusual in this day and age.</description>

      <description>MuckRock&#39;s George Levine did an interview with me for MuckRock News. Here&#39;s the start:
 In this week’s Requester’s Voice MuckRock goes hyperlocal with Ann Arbor’s Edward Vielmetti. From parking garages to sidewalks, Vielmetti is plugged in to the home of the Wolverines. He shows us how working with public documents should extend beyond federal fiddlings and can really have an impact on a local community. Formerly of AnnArbor.com, Vielmetti currently writes a weekly FOIA post for Damn Arbor.</description>

      <description>In among the pile of random things that you find when you have a teenager in the house, I located on old Omron pedometer whose battery had run down. One quick trip to CVS later, and I have a working tool to measure my physical activity.
In the winter months it&#39;s harder for me to get the outdoor exercise that I think I need. The days are shorter, the sidewalks are slipperier, and the excuses are more numerous to stay indoors where it&#39;s warm.</description>

      <description>From time to time I sit in front of a computer wanting to write, and nothing comes of the urge. Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than &#34;like&#34; or &#34;favorite&#34;.
The one place where writer&#39;s block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations.</description>

      <description>Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It&#39;s distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!
Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated.</description>

      <description>The key here is &#34;season to taste&#34;. We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious).
The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn&#39;t have so we didn&#39;t use them. I&#39;m sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor.</description>

      <description>Some maps of South Sudan, which is in the news today because of an emerging civil war.
UNOCHA South Sudan describes the displaced persons in South Sudan:
 On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town. During assessments in different neighbourhoods of Juba, protection agencies found several areas deserted, and witnessed looting.</description>

      <description>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was.
Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers.</description>

      <description>Toronto, Ontario is coated in ice tonight. A severe winter ice storm slowing the city to a slippery crawl, with widespread power outages. It&#39;s a city in crisis.
Mayor Rob Frod of Toronto is not the Mayor of Toronto; it&#39;s a Twitter parody account, prepared for the purpose of poking fun at Mayor Rob Ford.
A tale of two different worlds: One a joke and the other reality: @TOMayorFord and @TOMayorFrod The later proving the difference.</description>

      <description>On the Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index:
 The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness.</description>

      <description>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people&#39;s families. It&#39;s a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven&#39;t missed anything.
For all that Facebook is good at capturing people&#39;s thoughtfulness in the moment, it&#39;s a lousy place to publish anything enduring.</description>

No, I don&#39;t know either why Jackson Road is labeled as US-12. More details of the City of Ann Arbor plowing program at http://a2gov.org/snow.
How much snow did we get? The National Weather Service map says about 6 inches in Ann Arbor.</description>

      <description>I use OneTab (see: previously) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</description>

From detroitography.com:  Maps and geography of Detroit – that’s what we are all about. We like to write about maps that other people make about the city as well as create our own maps of Detroit.
 This map (one of many on the site) shows the overlap of what people map out when they say they are from Detroit. The densest is the downtown region only; the most generous encompasses a 9-county region.</description>

      <description>Talking to Vula is the story of the secret communications network of Operation Vula, a project of the African National Congress that facilitated clandestine messaging between South African exiles in London and leaders of the resistance in Zambia and in South Africa. The account (which was pointed out to me by Finn Brunton) talks of an inventive use of encrypted text transmitted via analog modem tones recorded to cassette tape and then played back via untraceable pay phones.</description>

      <description>Mack Collier has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (Here, go read it.) I&#39;m here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does.
Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That&#39;s a good style to recognize, and you&#39;ll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like &#34;</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there&#39;s a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m intrigued of late by the notion of &#34;small wins&#34;. This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker&#39;s book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you&#39;re really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn&#39;t register yet.</description>

In addition, on 8 December 2013 there were several aftershocks, including a magnitude 3.1 quake just after midnight local time.

      <description>This is a quote from (of all places) the National Plant Diagnostic Network&#39;s handbook on email security.
 Information leaks are also a problem with email. Emails are often forwarded beyond the original list of recipients — have you ever received an email from a friend with a confidentiality or copyright notice at the bottom? This is an attempt by your friend’s employer to make sure that confidential information does not get forwarded on to someone who is not supposed to see it.</description>

      <description>Saturday, 7 December 2013 - ANN ARBOR - It looks like the a2gov.org web site is not functioning correctly.
The error behavior is strange, in that every valid page fetched yields a blank page, but if you go to a page that&#39;s not valid on the site you get a 404 error (and another blank page).
I don&#39;t know if a2gov.org email is also affected. UPDATE: All systems appear to be functioning correctly again at 3:10p Saturday.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council&#39;s amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.

      <description>Not just because we lost (though you can&#39;t fault the coach for trying to win rather than going for the tie). Nope, it was a big disappointment because the kids couldn&#39;t park any cars on the lawn. A good day would have meant $20 or $25 a car, but even for the Big Game there were still free spaces on the street.</description>

      <description>Inbox zero just means that I have filled up the todo list. In this particular instance, my Gmail inbox is completely empty, and my todo list (kept in Github) has about 60 items on it, some of which have been on there for a year.
At some point you get to the state where there&#39;s one mostly-empty place and one mostly-full one, and the only way to reduce the total number of things outstanding is to copy items from one to the other, empty one of the buckets completely, and hope that you can avoid recopying by just doing things.</description>

      <description>A preview of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting for Monday, December 2, 2013; based on the agenda printed on Friday, November 29, 2013 at 6:00 p.m.
The hot issue for December 2, 2013 is the proposed repeal of the Ann Arbor pedestrian ordinance. If passed, city rules for pedestrians would revert to the Michigan state laws.
Another preview, with a lot more words, is at the Ann Arbor Chronicle.</description>

 CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.
 The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio&#39;s programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like Radio Reference and RepeaterBook to find the channels you want to have easy access to.</description>

      <description>The price of Bitcoin has soared in recent months, even though the Dread Pirate Roberts was taken offline. A recent graph shows the currency trading above $800.

What has changed that would drive the price from $140 to $800? The only simple answer (right or wrong) is China. The South China Morning Post reports -
 A US Senate hearing put bitcoin firmly in the mainstream and triggered fresh support from countries that tend to fall in line with America&#39;s financial regulatory regime.</description>

      <description>&#34;An Open Letter to President Coleman and Provost Pollack&#34;, published on um-openletter.eecs.umich.edu/ - from the lead paragraph:
 We, the undersigned faculty of the University of Michigan, support your intent to realign administrative expenses relative to revenues. However we collectively reject the proposed Administrative Services Transformation (AST) project. We respectfully offer an alternative approach to AST, which we call Unit- Centric Services (UCS). We believe that the AST approach is inherently flawed because its focus is on reducing administrative costs without taking into account the concurrent reduction in faculty and staff productivity, collaborative academic culture, and the unique needs of heterogeneous academic units.</description>

      <description>I used to organize lunch every Thursday at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. Then the restaurant closed, and my A2B3 lunch group was set adrift. Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve been up to.
First and foremost, the email list that goes with the group has been steady even with the disruption in the lunch routine. There&#39;s a steady stream of questions with answers, job postings, news about events and the like.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ll start with a confession: I don&#39;t think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. (&#34;Self-plagiarism is style.&#34;) The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it&#39;s not unusual for them to pull something they&#39;ve done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you&#39;re writing formulaic work that&#39;s short.</description>

      <description>I saw this today at the poster wall near the Fishbowl on the University of Michigan central campus. The #BBUM hashtag has been trending for a couple of days now. It stands for &#34;Being Black at the University of Michigan&#34;, and it&#39;s part of a brilliant campaign organized by the Black Student Union that shows no signs of stopping.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve temporarily restyled this weblog with colorful link text, as many people don&#39;t realize that I&#39;m linking to things.
The CSS is
 a:link { color: #c00 } /* unvisited links */ a:visited { color: #0c0 } /* visited links */ a:hover { color: #00c } /* user hovers */ a:active { color: #ccc } /* active links */  I&#39;m sure it could be better or different; indeed, that style didn&#39;t last long before I went to more typical blue for link text and purple for visited links.</description>

      <description>Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.
What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that&#39;s visibly not the only issue at hand.

      <description>High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.
From various sources including email and twitter; this is surely incomplete.
Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight&#39;s Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled.</description>

      <description>I went with S and J to the University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to David S. Carter (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.
There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated.</description>

There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn&#39;t running at the moment).</description>

      <description>As monitored via the Lapeer County Michigan scanner and via Twitter, there is a large fire in downtown Lapeer, Michigan. I&#39;m listening to the scanner and the fire is being actively fought, and there are over 700 people listening to the stream. The PIX Theater is the center of firefighting efforts, as far as I can tell. This is a snapshot of news coverage at 9:15 pm Eastern on November 12, 2013, and is bound to be updated by local media as details emerge.</description>

      <description>The Twenty Pound Carp is mounting a quixotic write-in campaign for Ann Arbor City Council in Ward 4, as evidenced by this campaign sign. It faces Democratic candidate Jack Eaton in the November 5, 2013 general election.
Even now political operative are fanning out across the 4th Ward and planting signs--signs of political change, yo. pic.twitter.com/qaC3Gxlnbw

The back story on this is hard to describe, but suffice it to say that when a bottom feeder takes interest in a political campaign, all bets are off.</description>

      <description>2012 was a disaster for Michigan apple growers, but 2013 has been a good year. From Capital Press:
 Michigan apple industry set new shipment records two weeks in a row in October — with the second and highest week being 414,702 boxes the week ending Oct. 12.
Michigan and New York are experiencing bumper crops following severely reduced crops in 2012 from spring freezes.
“Our growers, packers and shippers are working seven days a week, day and night, to move this crop,” said Diane Smith, executive director of the Michigan Apple Committee in Lansing.</description>

  While I deeply appreciate city council&#39;s dedication to a balanced budget and basic services, we cannot simply save our way to success. Post-Pfizer, Ann Arbor must increase its tax base by supporting a strong and diversified economy of high-growth, high tech companies.</description>

      <description>As sent to the Ann Arbor City Clerk, 23 October 2013:
To the clerk:
The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to spend money to replace them.
To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at council about the state of the lighting, I&#39;d like to make this request.</description>

That said, I&#39;m still happy with my issuetracker system, for which I&#39;m using Github&#39;s issues system as a personal productivity tool.

      <description>Our local Caribou Coffee closed its doors for the last time on Sunday. A trailer appeared in the front of it Monday sporting a Peet&#39;s logo. The effort to rebuild the corner coffee shop under a new name is expected to take a couple of weeks, with a planned opening date in mid-November.
Change is hard, and change in a coffee routine is doubly hard. The corner Caribou had been a study spot, a meeting place, a second office and a place to see Mike the Mailman.</description>

The a2trees app provides some kind of on-the-go listing of street trees in Ann Arbor that are interesting. The observation that there is a great apple crop in 2013 and that there are city trees laden with nice apples just waiting to be picked was the motivation.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s start with the lead of the NPR story -
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a health alert warning that an estimated 278 illnesses caused by Salmonella Heidelberg are associated with raw chicken produced by Foster Farms at three facilities in California.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says illnesses have been reported in 17 states, with the vast majority — 78 percent — in California.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.
Council discussed the situation in Portland, Oregon. Consumerist notes that parents there are recycling their dirty poopy diapers. (ew.)
 “It started when the city went to every other week garbage pickup,” the president of Far West Fibers, which handles much of the curbside recycling for Portland, tells Oregon Public Broadcasting.</description>

      <description>The new healthcare marketplace for the Affordable Care Act, Healthcare.GOV, has been operating slowly under the weight of open enrollment for &#34;Obamacare&#34; plans. The question then comes up: is this some kind of coordinated denial of service attack on the system, or is the system architecture simply slow under heavy load?

Reuters took a look at the issue, and found some problems with the healthcare marketplace&#39;s systems design.
 Five outside technology experts interviewed by Reuters, however, say they believe flaws in system architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems.</description>

      <description>The Tor Project runs Tor (&#34;The Onion Router&#34;), a network designed to provide its users with anonymity when using the Internet. Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.
Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer.</description>

      <description>Photo from Berin Szoka, used with permission, shows at center a black car that crashed into a security post after a shooting incident.

The best reporting from the Capitol today was from people close enough to the scene to be an eyewitness, yet not trapped in the need as a news organization to put a coherent story around the whole matter until it was well and thoroughly over. I&amp;#39;m watching the whole thing from my office.</description>

      <description>The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here&#39;s a 24 hour snapshot from the Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.</description>

      <description>The Daily Cal reports that power went out on the U Cal Berkeley campus at 4:45 p.m. local time on 30 September 2013, and that subsequently an explosion on campus at about 6:40 p.m. injured an unknown number of people. The report includes a striking photo of a manhole on fire. The campus has been evacuated.
The Berkeley scanner has live audio from the area; at this writing, there were over 140 people monitoring it.</description>

Work is underway to put in a temporary fix by diverting power from surrounding businesses and neighborhoods. A backup feeder line was offline, and full service restoration may take weeks.</description>

The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that&#39;s unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won&#39;t see something to fix, but as long as it&#39;s turned in on time and is the right shape and size I&#39;ve had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.</description>

 Some weaselly-looking character from an outfit called &#34;Just Energy&#34; knocked on our door today. They are of course scam artists and we just tell them we are not interested. They are very pushy and actually try to mislead people into thinking they have something to do with the utility companies. The especially like to prey on the elderly.  Complaints about this company are legion.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve started using Meetup.com to organize several groups. Here&#39;s some notes.
For the longest time I&#39;ve used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the a2b3 group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It&#39;s great to have a mailing list, but it&#39;s kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the a2b3 meetup which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch.</description>

 Should be some interesting listening on the aviation frequencies in the next 48 hours as Typhoon Usagi makes a direct hit on Hong Kong. I will go my best to keep the receiver on during the storm. You can find updated weather and weather radar at the Hong Kong Observatory - US Navy Forecast.
 Dan Van Hoy&#39;s personal weather station, mrdan.com, has real time weather, and his Hong Kong DX receiver tunes in AM, FM, aviation, and shortwave bands through Global Tuners.</description>

      <description>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I&#39;ll update when I&#39;ve actually made it myself to report back.
The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning.
Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes:
 AllRecipes adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing Epicurious replaces the mayo with heavy cream and adds some chopped parsley and mustard Boston Organics follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint The Floating Kitchen adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt Martha Stewart dresses the slaw with olive oil and lemon juice and skips the mayo Edible Twin Cities adds some fennel to the salad  I could continue but this is enough meta-information to head to the kitchen.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve had the occasion to send out requests for FOIA logs to several local units of government. Here&#39;s my varied experience with these requests. I&#39;m not certain that I have perfected the standard query, and so you shouldn&#39;t necessarily show the non-responsiveness of any given agency as a ding on them - it might be me.
The FOIA log is a set of records associated with FOIA requests. Typically I&#39;ve been asking for copies of FOIA request letters, the cover letters of responses that are sent back, but not the full details of the relevant documents.</description>

 Squirt WD-40 on the stuck valve on the supply line to the tank.
 Use elbow grease and a vise-grip to turn the supply line valve to &#34;off&#34;.
 Remind people not to use the toilet.

The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s not easy to do, but with a little bit of perseverance and a little bit of luck you may be able to listen to your favorite baseball team online without an MLB subscription by way of Global Tuners. Here&#39;s how it works (and why it&#39;s hard).
First, you&#39;ll need a Global Tuners account. This service provides you access to dozens of AM, FM, and short wave receivers around the world.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new?</description>

      <description>My friend Papillon is working on a double album &#34;Calligraphy&#34; which he&#39;s producing with the help of an Indiegogo campaign. Of this he says
 Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet. This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.
The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know what other people&#39;s experiences are, but increasingly I&#39;m finding that it makes sense for me to use my phone&#39;s wireless hotspot feature as my internet connection in cafes instead of the provided wifi.
The biggest difference I see is that with the phone my ping times are routinely in the 60-70 millisecond range, whereas cafe wifi in a busy cafe can see ping times at 1000 ms or more (looking at you, Starbucks).</description>

The Localwiki crew has developed a new hosting platform for people who want to start a wiki for their area, but who don&#39;t have the resources or the time or the skills to launch their own server.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m starting to use MedHelper for Android as a tool to keep track of my medicine. As you get older, it&#39;s more and more likely that you&#39;ll be on some medication, and since I&#39;ve had side effects from previous meds I&#39;m happy to find something that helps me track things.
It&#39;s a relatively complicated program compared to some simple pill reminder apps on the market, but my use is relatively simple.</description>

      <description>Originally seen on Deadline Detroit, my go-to place for quick hits on Detroit news - the Metro Times is up for sale. If you ever wanted to be in journalism now&#39;s your chance.
From the article -
 The company that owns the Metro Times told its Detroit staff this morning (August 26, 2013) the paper is for sale, throwing the future of the 33-year-old alternative weekly into doubt at a time of great uncertainty for print publications.</description>

The scanner chatter includes the usual traffic reports but also the distinctive cadence of firefighting operations - calls for &#34;Charlies&#34; (?), water tenders, and other fire equipment, and a fire coordinator asking a crew leader what additional resources they need.
This webcam photo from within Yosemite shows the intense smoke that characterizes this fire.</description>

      <description>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.
Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.
It&#39;s worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time.</description>

      <description>Two reports of a fire on the 900 block of Mary Street on Saturday at around 3:00 a.m. The sirens woke me up.
The AnnArbor.com story notes that a 3 car garage was destroyed and gives the &#34;we don&#39;t know very much&#34; report:
 The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.
 The Michigan Daily story gives more details, including a photo from neighbor Raymond Brokowski, and has this disturbing detail: it&#39;s being investigated as arson.</description>

      <description>We got some Prime Red apples at Farmer&#39;s Market from Wasem&#39;s Fruit Farm.
Prime Red is also known as Akane or Tokyo Rose. From Orange Pippin, an encyclopedia of apples:
 Akane was developed in Japan in the 1930s, and represents an unusual marriage of the classic English early variety, Worcester Pearmain, and the high quality American heritage apple variety, Jonathan - and it is a marriage that works very successfully.</description>

      <description>It wasn&#39;t completely internet-free, because there was wifi at my Mom&#39;s place and wifi at McDonald&#39;s for the occasional stops and wifi at the very nice Dead River Cafe in Marquette. But for the most part the net was kept at bay, since T-Mobile data service ended at Pinconning and I was with a phone that didn&#39;t have internet-everywhere coverage for the better part of a week.
There are a couple of places I would have liked to have captured in the moment while I was there with a camera and with Twitter to share them.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m still reading the darned thing, and sometimes I click on the links. But for now, at least, I&#39;m taking a vow of silence on Facebook. No poking people, no one-click birthday wishes, and no back-and-forth banter punctuated by screen refreshes hoping that there&#39;s something else of interest to look at.
I like you all out there in Facebook land, but something has to give, and I&#39;d rather be an old-school blogger that still puts out a post or two a week than an ace Facebook user with little to show for it after years of work except calluses on my fingers.</description>

      <description>On August 15 2013, Cisco announced that it would be laying off 5% of its workforce, or about 4000 employees. Some details:
 Cisco Q4 2013 earnings report does not mention layoffs Reuters: Cisco cutting 4,000 jobs Wall Street Journal: &#34;We just have too much in the middle of the organization,&#34; Mr. Chambers said. Techmeme leads with the WSJ story.  &#34;Because we need to continue to accelerate how we capture growth opportunities, we are taking a series of actions such as reducing management layers, prioritizing R&amp;amp;D investments and a workforce reduction affecting about 4,000 employees, or 5 percent of our workforce.</description>

      <description>Ten years ago, the power went out.
It&#39;s not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it&#39;s just you or if it&#39;s happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called Dave Langhorst, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup.</description>

      <description>I have a feeling that I&#39;m going to be doing a lot more writing using the Markdown language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown is supported by Typepad, supported by Octopress (with a bunch of enhancements), supported by Github (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), supported by Vim (with colorizing of text), and supported by Leanpub (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files).</description>

      <description>Setting up Octopress has given me a chance to look through some of my old Github repositories and re-assess what&#39;s there and how to improve on them. This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a github account.

To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown. Then you use a command line tool called &#39;rake&#39;, the Ruby version of &#39;make&#39;, to do the publishing.</description>

Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.
If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</description>

      <description>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out from the Ann Arbor District Library.
Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</description>

      <description>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.
The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates.</description>

      <description>I went to the City Planning Commission meeting on Wednesday, August 7, 2013. Here&amp;#39;s a few notes. The AnnArbor.com story about the meeting and a Civic News Ticker from the Ann Arbor Chronicle focus on a vacant parcel on Packard near Platt that&amp;#39;s currently zoned for single-family residential. The owner of the property wants to put a duplex on the site, and asked to have the the parcel rezoned to a new zoning that would also allow duplexes.</description>

      <description>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most complete collection of links about the Bezos transaction.
Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print.</description>

      <description>TOR is an anonymous network set up originally by the US Navy in order to support cloaked access by the US Government to the Internet. Users access the network through a computer or browser set up to point traffic towards a network of &amp;quot;onion routers&amp;quot;, which scramble the path that the packet takes to eventually reach the Internet. There are also provisions for &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; web sites or hidden service operators to exist within the TOR network, which should in theory be reachable anonymously by TOR users but not the great outside Internet.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Make the pile smaller&amp;quot; is a strategy for dealing with impossible tasks. Rather than try to solve them all at once, you simply try to make them a bit smaller. Find a few bits of things at the top of the pile, sort through them, and then consider that a small victory. Move on to some other pile until you have at least made enough superficial progress to have a sense of accomplishment.</description>

      <description>The question from a story in the Marquette Mining Journal:
 MARQUETTE - Marquette County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Solka heard oral arguments Thursday on a case involving whether the Northern Michigan Geologic Repository Association is a public body subject to producing financial information under the Freedom of Information Act.
The association is important to plaintiffs in the case because it was created under state law requirements by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which makes it a public body by extension, the plaintiffs contend.</description>

First and foremost, it&amp;#39;s a lot harder to type on a tiny screen with one finger poking at the glass. My online composition is sufficiently slow that I can&amp;#39;t come anywhere near close to keeping up with my thoughts.</description>

      <description>With 25 days to go, the FOIA Machine kickstarter is almost 2x overfunded. They are looking to build a system for automatically tracking and managing FOIA requests.
I am not clear how this effort differs from the already existing MuckRock News system, but there&amp;#39;s room for innovation in the space because FOIA can be the world&amp;#39;s worst search engine and any help is welcomed.

      <description>It&#39;s all over the local news, but it&#39;s a national story as well: Detroit has filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
New York Times: Detroit Files for Bankruptcy, July 18. &#34;Detroit, the cradle of America’s automobile industry and once the nation’s fourth-most-populous city, has filed for bankruptcy, an official said Thursday afternoon, the largest American city ever to take such a course.&#34;

      <description>This message was forwarded from an initial message sent by Marcia Higgins, who is on Ann Arbor City Council. I am not certain how else this meeting was promoted; there&amp;#39;s no sign of this on the city&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;News&amp;quot; page, nor does a full text search of the City web site turn up a copy of it elsewhere. It affects everyone who goes to U of Michigan football games.
The Ann Arbor dotcom had previously reported on the same plans when they surfaced in 2010, and provides a few more details in their 2013 story.</description>

      <description>This press release from the City of Ann Arbor was sent to news media on June 28, 2013. As far as I can tell, AnnArbor.com did not run a story. The Ann Arbor Chronicle did publish information about this discharge as part of its meeting reporting for the July 15, 2013 city council meeting.
UPDATE: AnnArbor.com story of July 19, 2013 is up now.
A copy of this news release is available on the Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository (a2docs), but there&amp;#39;s no copy to be found on the City of Ann Arbor web site as of this writing.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor DDA has launched a new web site, and one of the features of it is a map with information available in real time about parking availability at various structures.
 
The structures are in a shade of pale blue, and the lots are in pale green; my current location is marked with a bubble. If you&amp;#39;re looking for just space available information, there&amp;#39;s a JSON file with that data; you&amp;#39;ll have to unpack it to map structures to their ID numbers.</description>

      <description>As reviewed on Wikipedia -
 These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&amp;#0160;perceived&amp;#0160;as two different cities.
 The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies.</description>

      <description>More often than not, I am hearing about the death of friends or family through Facebook. I suppose this isn&amp;#39;t surprising; after all, I hear about babies born on the same site. Local newspapers are too slow or too local or publish too infrequently to be a source for family news. The Facebook wall makes as good a place as any to share condolences and to make plans for funerals.</description>

Zimmerman&amp;#0160;wikipedia page. As of 10:20 p.m. ET, I&amp;#39;m one of 6210 people listening, and there have been a dozen edits in the 20 minutes since the trial concluded. UPDATE: at 11:00 p.m. ET, the count of scanner listeners is 7355, down from a high of over 7600. Other busy scanners on Broadcastify include Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles.</description>

 &amp;quot;But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted.</description>

      <description>Karl Pohrt died Wednesday, July 10, 2013, after a battle with anaplastic thyroid cancer. He wrote about books and life on his weblog &amp;quot;there is no gap&amp;quot;. Karl was the owner of the Shaman Drum Bookshop, an independent bookstore on Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s State Street which closed in 2009 after a 29 year run.

      <description>It&amp;#39;s hard not to predict a mortgage crisis after looking at this graph, which shows that from 2004 to 2009 the quality of loans from a major national mortgage company got worse every single month.
It&amp;#39;s from a paper called&amp;#0160;
Liar’s Loan? Effects of Origination Channel and Information Falsification on Mortgage Delinquency
and it&amp;#39;s figure 3 there.</description>

      <description>The Detroit Sound Conservancy has a Kickstarter project going to raise $5,000 towards preserving the history of Detroit music through a series of oral history interviews of Detroit area music critics and journalists.
 There is no public oral history archive dedicated to Detroit music. We are going to build one. You can help. We are going to start with the &amp;quot;first responders&amp;quot; to the Detroit sound: Detroit music journalists. Detroit music journalists have been key archivists of Detroit sounds that have changed the world, from Motown to techno, blues to jazz, to so much more.</description>

      <description>Google Latitude, a location sharing service, is shutting down. There&amp;#39;s not much of a surprise to this; the system was never very popular, with only (by various accounts) 5 or 9 or some other very small number of people using it. (I kid, but not by much). The best application for it appeared to be very close groups like families who wanted to keep track of where various family members were at the moment.</description>

As an introduction to this, here&amp;#39;s a simple poll: what are good ways that you suggest to meet new people? You&amp;#39;ll get a choice of two from the list to pick which one is better, and if you have a better idea you can add it in.</description>

Feedly seems to be the winner so far, with the bulk of the feed-reading traffic to this site coming from there.</description>

      <description>The streets of Toronto are full of water as over 100 mm of rain (about 4 inches) has fallen in some areas. Meteorologists are making comparisons with Hurricane Hazel, which flooded the area in 1954.
Some of the best brief accounts are on Twitter, using the various hashtags #TOflood, #floodTO, #TOstorm, #stormTO, and #darkTO. I listened to CBC Radio 1 Toronto for a while to get a sense for how bad it is.</description>

His first writeup of it describes version one of a tracking system:
 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, responsible for overseeing the US government&amp;#39;s foreign surveillance activities via FISA, actually does have a&amp;#0160;public website. They seem to have just created it, as it doesn&amp;#39;t have any documents from before June of 2013, and the Wayback Machine&amp;#0160;has no record of it&amp;#0160;prior to that.</description>

      <description>Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777, crash landed at San Francisco Airport on Saturday, July, 2013 with 307 passengers and crew on board. As of this writing (1:19 PM PT) there are no confirmed fatalities, but it&amp;#39;s too early yet to give a final accounting. The plane did not report any problems before landing, and caught fire on the ground.
SFO airport was closed for several hours, and flights were diverted to other area airports.</description>

Lots of candy, lots of politicians, lots of kids on bikes.

      <description>Douglas Engelbart has died at the age of 88.
New York Times obit from John Markoff:
 Douglas C. Engelbart, a visionary scientist whose singular epiphany in 1950 about technology’s potential to expand human intelligence led to a host of inventions — among them the computer mouse — that became the basis for both the Internet and the modern personal computer, died on Tuesday at his home in Atherton, Calif. He was 88.</description>

      <description>What do you use for an address book on your computer or mobile phone, and are you happy with it? I have the sense that there could be much better tools for collecting useful scraps of information about your correspondents, but nothing I&amp;#39;ve seen recently answers the nagging feeling that we could be doing better with this.
The two apps that I have seen that do something different in this space are Evernote Hello and Brewster.</description>

A Greasemonkey script to remove the Yahoo eyebrow uses Javascript. A key element reads
 document.getElementById(&amp;#39;eyebrow&amp;#39;).style.display = &amp;#39;none&amp;#39;; A second approach uses Adblock Plus&amp;#0160;to wipe out the ads for Yahoo services; note, you might have to buy into a lot more than just blocking this ad if you go that route.
A third route uses CSS to hide the offending elements; I saw it fly past this a.</description>

 Vacuum&#39;s subject material is a hodgepodge, but that&#39;s because Vielmetti sees the blog very much in the classical context: as a personal, yet very public, journal. A longtime notebook keeper, Vielmetti sees Vacuum mostly as just another way to record and archive his own thoughts--although it recently hit a traffic milestone, with one million total page views.
 Patrick Dunn&#39;s story also has accounts from A2Gastroboy, Ben Connor Barrie of Damn Arbor, and Mark Maynard.</description>

      <description>Several streets in Ann Arbor have flooded as a result of slow-moving storm cells that passed through the city on the afternoon of Thursday, June 27, 2013. Reports are still filtering in, but here&amp;rsquo;s what I know about right now.
The City of Ann Arbor is building a “Citizen Storm Corps” volunteer group to assist in stormwater/flooding data collection. Volunteers will visit Large Event Data Gathering locations after significant rain events, record visual observations about the stormwater&amp;rsquo;s behavior at that location using a LEDG Stormwater/Flooding Reporting Form, and submit the data to the city.</description>

      <description>Joyent has released Manta, a computing environment that includes a powerful map/reduce system which leverages native Unix commands. Unlike a Hadoop world where you have to spin up a Java environment to get anything done, Manta makes map/reduce as simple as possible for those of us who know the Unix shell pretty well.
Some examples may be useful.
for n in $HOME/doc/books/* do wc -l $n &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $TMP/wc-tmp done awk &amp;#39;{ t += $1 } END { print t }&amp;#39; &amp;lt; $TMP/wc-tmp  has an equivalent in Manta as something like</description>

      <description>People in Urbana Illinois are up in arms that the Urbana Free Library director decided to discard a large portion of the library&amp;#39;s non fiction collection. Shelves were left bare after books older than 10 years old were summarily discarded. Citizens, up in arms after their library collection was decimated, packed a library board meeting to demand answers.
Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&amp;#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day.</description>

The power outage map from Xcel Energy would be the normal reference point for storm analysis, but they have had so much traffic to the page that the power outage map is behaving intermittently.</description>

      <description>Ever since upgrading my Mac to 10.6.8 I&amp;#39;ve been running into memory problems, especially when I have a lot of Chrome windows open. I solved this problem - or I seem to have - by upgrading from 2G to 4G of memory, with memory from Crucial. Less than $100 spent, and the computer no longer starts to thrash when I have more than a few windows open.
Now of course it&amp;#39;s time to keep a lot more apps open to see what the new system limits are.</description>

Flooding and flash flooding has affected large parts of southern Alberta, due in part to a slow-moving storm front that is dumping a lot of rain on the area, up to 7.5 inches in 2.5 days. Three people have died from the flooding.

 At the&amp;#0160;Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited&amp;#0160;(BSNL),&amp;#0160;India&amp;#39;s state-owned telecom company, a message emerges from a dot matrix printer addressing a soldier&amp;#39;s Army unit in&amp;#0160;Delhi.&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;GRANDMOTHER SERIOUS. 15 DAYS LEAVE EXTENSION,&amp;quot; it reads. It&amp;#39;s one of about 5,000 such missives still being sent every day by telegram – a format favored for its &amp;quot;sense of urgency and authenticity,&amp;quot; explains a BSNL official.</description>

      <description>As reported in the Ann Arbor Chronicle:
 A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers.
  An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn.</description>

      <description>I have a fickle relationship with reminder systems. Usually the drill is to discover something new, vigorously dump everything I can possibly think into it, and then slowly but surely get disillusioned with it as time goes on. The smell of a new system is seductive, and when something new comes along there&amp;#39;s a tendency to look at its good side and to focus on the bad parts of whatever you were using before.</description>

      <description>The web site is http://higginsforcouncil.com . It was once a campaign website; it&amp;#39;s now an anti-campaign site, with the (anonymous) person hosting it heaping invective and scorn upon a local politician.
If you&amp;#39;re running for office and have a web site set up to support your campaign, use some of your campaign money to buy a domain registration that lasts a long time. You&amp;#39;ll avoid problems like this in the future.</description>

I tried to include enough maps that someone far away from the fire (like me) would find some context for it that made sense, and enough detailed links to more local reporting and official sources that someone nearby would be able to get to the resource that had more current and on-the-spot coverage than I could ever do.</description>

      <description>UPDATED Thursday June 13, 6:00 p.m MT with new maps at the top.
The fast-moving Black Forest Fire is burning homes northeast of Colorado Springs, Colorado. High temperatures, high winds, and low humidity are fanning the flames. Two people are known to have died in the fire, and more than 360 homes have been lost. If you are near the fire, please seek out current and official information rather than relying on this weblog.</description>

      <description>This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It&amp;#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain. A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&amp;#39;t write it down now it&amp;#39;ll be gone forever. It&amp;#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m fond of TuneIn, a free service that lets you tune in to radio broadcasts from all over the world. I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&amp;#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&amp;#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel.
One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&amp;#39;s playing now and who&amp;#39;s playing whom.</description>

      <description>Open up a &amp;quot;New Post&amp;quot; window, start typing.
Look at the categories on the right side of the screen - my screen, not yours. There&amp;#39;s an infinite scrolling list of them, from &amp;quot;Americana&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;zzz Draft Postings&amp;quot;. Somehow, categories became the wrong way to describe what is in this blog; aside from &amp;quot;Ann Arbor&amp;quot;, there&amp;#39;s few of them that have routine postings. But with almost 3000 articles written, it&amp;#39;s had to imagine any coherent way to recategorize them.</description>

      <description>Some notes on a 30th high school reunion, written last summer but just now published.
There&amp;#39;s a certain ritual set of behavior you can safely engage in when you talk to someone who you vaguely remember from high school but have been completely out of touch with for 30 years.
Ask about where they are living now, and discovered that most of your classmates moved more than 200 miles away from home.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&amp;#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&amp;#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.
The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&amp;#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting.</description>

      <description>A few highlights, not the whole talk.
My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.
For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.
Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;followers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</description>

      <description>A sample screen grab from tonight&amp;#39;s W8UM net on 145.23. Please note that the radio I&amp;#39;m using looks like it&amp;#39;s out of tune a little bit, since I&amp;#39;m actually listening here on 145.217.
 
It was a good clear strong signal (the red/yellow line), even with the not very good antenna I have; it should be, since the transmitter is only about a mile from here.</description>

      <description>A late night Hacker News summary, pulling from&amp;#0160;https://news.ycombinator.com/.

      <description>There are multiple rumors on Twitter - as of yet unconfirmed - that KMOV-TV has reported a &amp;ldquo;mass casualties&amp;rdquo; event at a Holiday Inn in Earth City, MO as a result of the storms that are going through St Louis on the evening of May 31, 2013. There is not yet any photo evidence or any web page from a reliable source to confirm this.
Let&amp;rsquo;s hope this is just an Internet rumor.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker&#39;s Internet Trends.
I&#39;m going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me.</description>

      <description>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&amp;#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini. This comes together in a hurry - you can cook the whole thing up in the time it takes to boil the pasta.
Ingredients:
 Olive oil Two or three cloves of garlic Asparagus, about a pound Button mushrooms, about a pound Basil, dried or fresh White wine  Preparation:</description>

      <description>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&amp;#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&amp;#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market!
Ingredients:
 oil for frying garlic 1 bag kale corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better green onions - chopped soy sauce  Method:</description>

      <description>Yesterbox is a technique from Zappo&amp;#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &amp;quot;inbox zero&amp;quot; for today&amp;#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&amp;#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&amp;#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&amp;#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.
The biggest problem with &amp;quot;inbox zero&amp;quot; is that it&amp;#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been writing summaries of the day&amp;#39;s Hacker News, after a challenge from Kyle Mulka to do the same. Here&amp;#39;s some observations summarized from that effort.
Writing summaries is easier with practice. If you know what you&amp;#39;re looking for, you can reduce a long article to some pithy bits just by finding the one quotable sentence in the whole thing that stands in for the whole. If there&amp;#39;s no pithy bit, then you hope that the title or the first paragraph is good enough.</description>

      <description>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&amp;#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each.
I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&amp;#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news.</description>

      <description>Dan Murphy wrote this biography of the fictional character Jay Gatsby for Wikipedia in 2009. Since then, the anonymous hordes of Wikipedia editors have not improved upon the page. Here is the 23 October 2009 version of &amp;quot;Jay Gatsby&amp;quot;, which is much better written than the current edition.
&amp;#0160;
Jay Gatsby&amp;#0160;is the&amp;#0160;titular character&amp;#0160;of&amp;#0160;F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s 1925 novel&amp;#0160;The Great Gatsby. The character has become an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join&amp;#0160;High society&amp;#0160;and the name has become synonymous with successful businessmen with shady pasts in the US.</description>

      <description>This is breaking news, and this blog post will be out of date.
The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River has collapsed near Mount Vernon, Washington. A map shows where the incident happened, about half way between Seattle and the Canadian border.
 
As of this writing there are no confirmed details about the cause of the bridge collapse. The Seattle Times says it may have been because an oversized truck hit the bridge with its load.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#39;s the word from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt:
 Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&amp;#0160;
 That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after the peonies start but before the u-pick strawberries are ready.

      <description>Here are some notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of May 22, 2013. They are in no way reflective of everything that was discussed at the meeting; indeed, there&amp;#39;s some things here that we didn&amp;#39;t talk about at the meeting that I discovered later. But here goes anyway.
1. How does Bitcoin work? I&amp;#39;m looking at the Khan Academy series on Bitcoin and listened to one lecture which seems to spell it out quite well.</description>

      <description>Strawberry season is on its way. Here&amp;#39;s some first estimates of picking times, based on email or postings from local U-Pick strawberry farms.
Rawsonville: Rowe&amp;#39;s Produce Farm has an active Facebook page, and doesn&amp;#39;t yet have details of when first harvest will be. Their strawberries survived earlier frost scares. No U-Pick raspberries this year. &amp;#0160;UPDATE: Rowe&amp;#39;s will open for the season on June 8, berries&amp;#0160;$1.78 per pound.
Ida: Whittaker&amp;#39;s Berry Farm (also on Facebook) is estimating first picking to start between June 10 and June 15, and notes that an average season is 18 days long.</description>

      <description>This map from the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma (via Atlantic Cities) shows the destructive path of the Moore, Oklahoma tornado of 20 May 2013. This is a preliminary map that also shows the track of a 3 May 1999 tornado that followed a very similar path.
 
There&amp;#39;s too much graphic, devastating imagery from the scene which I won&amp;#39;t include here. Dr Jeff Masters has an excellent overview of the meteorology of the event, including accounts of debris being thrown 100 miles in the air to land on Tulsa, Oklahoma.</description>

      <description>Credit to Salon&amp;#39;s Andrew Leonard for the article &amp;quot;Revenge, ego, and the corruption of Wikipedia&amp;quot;, which unmasks wiki-troll Qworty and his pattern of anonymous mean-spirited edits to settle old grudges. Qworty - his real name is not important to my discussion of him - was a prolific Wikipedian. He routinely sabotaged the biographies of rival writers by doing things like removing lists of literary prizes they had won after they had died.</description>

      <description>The site loads slowly, the photos are all squished together, and the carefully curated metadata and tags and comments and photo names are de-emphasized. It&amp;#39;s like a weird mix of Pinterest and Tumblr.
I&amp;#39;m hoping for a classic.flickr.com to preserve the old UI, in the same way that old-school Weather Underground users can use classic.wunderground.com to see things the way they were meant to be.
If I had the time, I&amp;#39;d cherry pick the best photos from my Flickr stream and blog about them here.</description>

      <description>Yahoo is in talks to acquire Tumblr, with a price tag north of a billion dollars. Who knew that simplifying the blogging interface could be so profitable? I wonder, though, how Yahoo is going to make money off of Tumblr page views without ruining the service. (cf Flickr) (cf MyBlogLog) (cf GeoCities) etc. &amp;#0160;See what Tumblr users think of the acquisition.

      <description>I wrote an early review of Contactually, and I signed up for their pro service after the trial period expired. I used the system for a couple of months, but have decided to back down from the pro version back to the free version for a while. Here are some reasons for that.
First and perhaps foremost, Contactually is relatively expensive at $20/mo. I looked at what I was spending (or not spending) on other internet services that I use and like.</description>

 Generation X is a journeyman. It didn’t invent hip hop, or punk rock, or even electronica (it’s pretty sure those dudes in Kraftwerk are boomers) but it perfected all of them, and made them its own. It didn’t invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing. Generation X gave you Google and Twitter and blogging; Run DMC and Radiohead and Nirvana and Notorious B.</description>

      <description>You run a library; it gets donations, from time to time, of books or other materials. Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age?
One approach is the &amp;quot;virtual bookplate&amp;quot;, described in this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida. The catalog is extended to include graphics that honor the donor of the materials, and the search is extended to make it easy to look up all of the works that were donated by a particular individual.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time there was a Journal of Irreproducable Results, which published science humor. It started in 1955, says Wikipedia, and saw a schism in 1995 that led to the founding of the Annals of Improbable Research. AIR is noted for its awarding of the prestigous Ig Nobel awards, rewarding achievements that&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&amp;quot;.
Now the august journal Nature is getting into the fray, with an entire special issue on Challenges in Irreproducable Research.</description>

  We did one other thing. We arranged all the attributes in alphabetical order, and then used a random number generator to select (without replacement) either 10 or 15 attributes from among them and then replicated this experiment a number of times. Here are the results for one particular replication of the experiment for truly hypothetical wines.</description>

      <description>From Systemantics, the systems bible:
 While Systems-people share certain attributes in common, each specific system tends to attract people with specific sets of attributes. For example, people who are attracted to auto racing are likely to be people who enjoy driving fast, tinkering with high-powered cars, and beating other people in fierce competition. The System calls forth those attributes in its members and rewards the extreme degrees of them. But a word of warning is in order.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#39;re hunting morels, you know that the first rule of putting dots on a map to say where you found them is to be imprecise. It&amp;#39;s OK to say which county you located the morels in, but don&amp;#39;t narrow it down any more than that. I happen to know that morels can be found in Marquette County, but even my mom won&amp;#39;t always provide an exact location.
With this mapping in mind, here&amp;#39;s a few sources for early morel sightings in Michigan.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve done a bunch of things in my life, so many so that a traditional style resume gets impossibly bulky if I have to add more than a few words per job.
Would it be too much to convert a resume to shorthand? There must be emoji that describe job qualities. A job that you didn&amp;#39;t like might get this unicode character, for instance.</description>

      <description>I do a lot of writing in vim these days, in part because my fingers already know how to make words move around on the page. I find it easier to do the work in a place where I can rely on muscle memory for routine changes rather than have to laboriously guide the mouse around to do edits.
Once upon a time there was an outlining tool called MaxThink (it still exists, for Windows only) that applied the same kind of keyboard-heavy work to outline editing.</description>

A diligent editor created a category of &amp;quot;American women novelists&amp;quot; and began adding female novelists to it, and then removing them from the category &amp;quot;American novelists&amp;quot;. A predictable hue and cry ensued. James Gleick tells the story in some detail in the NY Review of Books, under the title &amp;quot;Wikipedia&amp;#39;s Women Problem&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>I had the good fortune to talk about Arborwiki and Localwiki at eChicago in April 2013. Here are the notes that I took in preparation for the talk; the actual text of the talk varied from this, since I was speaking impromptu.
About Arborwiki
Who: More than a dozen core contributors over the lifespan of the project, plus many more who have made small edits to pages.
Where: Greater Ann Arbor - including Washtenaw County and the farmers who come to the Farmers Market from surrounding counties.</description>

      <description>For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&amp;rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.
I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them.</description>

      <description>I was reading this Medium post from Eric E Anderson on blog design and especially on sidebars, and decided to rework the design of this blog. No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&amp;#39;m working on upper right.
The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&amp;#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.</description>

      <description>Some will say that you should schedule your posts or tweets for a certain particular time of day, when it&amp;#39;s scientifically proven (by data scientists) that you&amp;#39;ll get the maximum number of page views or retweets or some other measure of progress. (Bitly says Monday between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern is good.)
Perhaps that&amp;#39;s true, but here&amp;#39;s the argument for posting now rather than scheduling into the near future.</description>

      <description>&amp;#0160;
 Localwiki  In Wikipedia, every article is measured against a broad global sense of &amp;quot;notability&amp;quot;. An individual or a topic has to be notable and newsworthy enough to be included, and though the standards vary there is some global consensus to what it means. If an article doesn&amp;#39;t meet the grade, it&amp;#39;s subject to deletion. &amp;#0160;
On a Localwiki, every article is measured against an individual sense of &amp;quot;locality&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Runtastic is a workout tracking program for Android. It lets you keep track of where you have gone on your run, bike ride, or walk (or a bunch of other means of locomotion) and using the GPS in the phone makes some estimate of how far you&amp;#39;ve gone and how much effort you have expended.&amp;#0160;
I&amp;#39;ve also used Cardiotrainer for this purpose, which has a similar reason for being.
It&amp;#39;s really handy to have your device track where you go so that you get a nice map of your journey.</description>

      <description>This map from MLive shows roads closed due to flooding in Western Michigan. (Turn around, don&amp;#39;t drown). Click through for the interactive version.
 
A similar map from NOAA shows flood gauge readings across the area.
 
The purple gauge in this above map is Grand Rapids at Comstock Park, which is showing flooding at almost 6 feet above flood stage.
 
The historical big flood in Grand Rapids is from 1904; this collection rephotographs scenes from that flood in 2004.</description>

      <description>I was out for a walk along the Huron River, and Runtastic mapped it as though I was actually in the middle of the river.
 
There&amp;#39;s actually a path in the &amp;quot;middle&amp;quot; of the river, a berm that separates the Argo Cascades city park from the Huron River per se. Microsoft and Nokia don&amp;#39;t appear to know about that path, just illustrating some of the perils of computing walking directions in an urban environment.</description>

      <description>From the Bitcointalk forums, 2011: &amp;quot;Bitcoins are peacock tails&amp;quot;
A series of studies, &amp;quot;Peacocks, Porsches and Thorstein Veblen: Conspicuous Consumption as a Sexual Signaling System,&amp;quot; was published recently in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&amp;#0160;A peacock&amp;#39;s tail is beautiful: magnificent plumage, iridescent colors. Alas, it is also wasteful. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to develop. Sound like bitcoins?
Let&amp;#39;s look at the Bitcoin as a signal of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste.</description>

      <description>The Boeing 787 fleet was grounded because of battery problems. The FAA has recently approved engineering fixes to their battery system, and the planes will be back in the air perhaps within weeks.
Some details:
From the New York Times:
Boeing’s fixes include better insulation for the batteries’ eight cells, and a stainless steel box designed to encase the batteries and contain fire and vent possible smoke or hazardous gases out of the planes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve started looking into software defined radio for Mac OS X. The goal is to take a cheap USB stick, plug it in to the Mac, and have it connect to software that will decode radio signals.
So far there&amp;#39;s nothing obvious that&amp;#39;s packaged as a single collection of software plus hardware, but that&amp;#39;s not surprising.
My best notes to date are from Pinboard&amp;#39;s t:sdr tag, which looks like it has a few dozen people sharing links.</description>

      <description>Every year on Earth Day I do a ritual weeding of our back yard garden and pick whatever garlic mustard I can find. We&amp;#39;ve been thinning out the garlic mustard every year for years and so it&amp;#39;s mostly in check but it&amp;#39;s always worth pulling a few more plants.
Aside from putting the garlic mustard in the municipal compost - not your own compost - there&amp;#39;s always a temptation to eat at least some of what gets pulled.</description>

      <description>My first reaction to the horrible events of today:
 Don&amp;#39;t look at pictures, especially not the graphic ones. There isn&amp;#39;t time to react. Focus on something small, like a neighbor who was running the marathon who is ok. Mistrust many news sources, because some people will write anything to get attention.  The Wikipedia page is pretty reasonable for coverage, though from time to time nonsense sneaks in.

I&amp;#39;m happy to have a chance to keep working on this, since even the smallest amount of money from new sales covers the direct costs &amp;#0160;of coffee to do the writing.</description>

      <description>A lovely day for a foolish parade. We were out and got some choice standing places in the springtime sunshine, and when the parade got to be too much for the youngest of the party, we went out for hot chocolate and a muffin.
This photo gives some idea of the fun. I didn&amp;#39;t get a picture of my favorite puppet, which was a camera complete with &amp;quot;flash&amp;quot;. This was definitely a time to get photos with as much resolution as you can.</description>

      <description>There are lots of Fool Moon photos from 2013 online; I&amp;#39;ll note them here as I find collections. But I thought I&amp;#39;d add my own in to start of this cat/bunny/Peep.
 
Some collections:
Moon Unit Face Pong.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;A video booth projected faces into a moon from green screen onto a building in real-time, while Fool Mooners play pong with the faces using wii-motes.&amp;quot;
Myra Klarman: FoolMoon 2013. &amp;quot;It was great to see so many veteran and first-time Fools participating in FoolMoon 2013.</description>

 Hope to see you there!</description>

      <description>The National Security Agency has declassified a number of issues of CRYPTOLOG, their in-house magazine. Here&amp;#39;s an example from 1977, announcing the publication (for anyone with a Top Secret Codeword clearance) of Katharine Swift&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Collected Articles on Code Reconstruction&amp;quot;. &amp;#0160;&amp;quot;It is hoped that managers as well as book-breakers and programmers, and senior analysts as well as neophytes, will find material that will help each in making his individual contribution on the job.</description>

      <description>North Quad at the U of Michigan had a flood today, causing classes to be cancelled and students to be evacuated from their rooms. There is no estimate of the damage at this time, but it&#39;s extensive.
The University of Michigan School of Information has a flood information page with reschedule and relocate information for classes and talks.
 All media inquires about the flooding should be directed to Kelly Cunningham in the UM Public Affairs Office: kecunham@umich.</description>

      <description>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them.

Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network.
It&#39;s OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts.</description>

      <description>Do I understand this? No. But this is a blog called Vacuum, and this is my service to that task.
Two forthcoming European Physical Journal D papers challenge established wisdom about the nature of vacuum. In one paper, Marcel Urban from the University of Paris-Sud, located in Orsay, France and his colleagues identified a quantum level mechanism for interpreting vacuum as being filled with pairs of virtual particles with fluctuating energy values.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things.
The thought is that at some times I&amp;#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&amp;#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down.
The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out.</description>

      <description>If you, like me, are interested in how systems work and when they fail, here are three good sources to look at from the internet persective on global network behavior.
The outages mailing list (outages at outages.org) describes itself as follows:
 The primary goal of this mailing list (&amp;quot;outages&amp;quot;) is for outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you&#39;re online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly.
The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m going to try to review two different applications for Android that are designed to track your sleeping habits and improve your ability to wake up on time.
Both SleepBot (http://mysleepbot.com/) and SleepTime (http://www.azumio.com/apps/sleep-time/) have the same basic strategy. You put your phone under your pillow and go to sleep. The phone&#39;s accelerometer notices your tossing and turning or your deeply quiet snoozing, and keeps track of same overnight. When it comes to be time to wake up, they look for a time window when you&#39;re not in deep sleep in order to maximize the chance that you wake up refreshed.</description>

      <description>One cup of coffee generated about 1400 words. Of those, I needed about 1000. It took three hours to write the 1400 words, and two hours more to remove 400 of them. I hope I removed the right ones.
It only took forty five words to summarize the day.</description>

      <description>I have an old Macbook (4,1) that my friends at the Apple store remind me that I should be replacing. But I&amp;#39;d like to squeeze a bit more life out of it.
The biggest issue has been with memory usage. Chrome has been more and more aggressive about using processes to keep one crashy tab from crashing the whole system, but this is done at the expense of memory consumption. One too many tabs and the poor laptop starts to thrash, which is no fun.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the scenario. You and your team work hard to use a new piece of collaboration software that offers some unique features that are suited either to the work at hand or that appeal to your sense of novelty. The tool works great and you get into it, using some of the more complex parts of the system to great advantage. Then the system&amp;rsquo;s owners send out the dreaded self-congratulatory message saying that they have been acquired by a big company, or some beleagured product manager announces that their system is being sunsetted.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t had a working smart phone in months, and so the times when I find myself needing to write down short messages to the world don&amp;#39;t always coincide with the times that I&amp;#39;m on the net. Hence this version of &amp;quot;pocket twitter&amp;quot;, writing down things that you want to share (or to remember) on paper, and saving that paper away until the next time it&amp;#39;s possible to share a photograph.</description>

      <description>GriefNet&amp;#0160;is an Internet community approach to on line grief support, providing support to people working through loss and grief issues of all kinds. Cendra Lynn is the leader of the organization, and I had some small technological part in starting it back in 1993 when the appropriate technology of the day was Gopher, not the World Wide Web. The system hosts dozens of moderated mailing lists for people who share a common loss like the death of a spouse or the loss of a child.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on http://am1610.org . The show is &amp;quot;The Strait&amp;quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&amp;#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&amp;#39;s always worth a listen.&amp;#0160;
Some day I&amp;#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&amp;#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it.</description>

      <description>If my Google Analytics reporting is to be behaved, the peak of Google Reader usage for me was in mid 2008, and by early 2010 it had been reduced to background noise. I can understand based on this graph (and perhaps millions of other graphs like it) that it might be time to call it quits.
It looks like from other charts (that I won&amp;#39;t show here) that Twitter picked up the slack, as did Facebook.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m working on a book on the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, which is just about half done. You can see a copy on LeanPub at http://leanpub.com/michigan-foia . There are some sample chapters to download for free, or you can get the whole thing in its current draft state for a price that you choose. It&amp;#39;s as good a time as any to let people know about it, since this week is Sunshine Week 2013.</description>

 in the log files. I&amp;#39;ve got monitoring set up to notice when this happens, but so far this has been a stumper. Apologies for the occasional downtime.
I&amp;#39;m now monitoring with monit&amp;#0160;which if it&amp;#39;s working correctly should automatically restart the server if it&amp;#39;s wedged.</description>

      <description>The paper is Social Resilience in Online Communities: The Autopsy of Friendster, http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109.
There&amp;#39;s math in there which I don&amp;#39;t understand, but this graph seems to sum it up:
 
The thesis is that if enough of your friends drop off of a service, you will too, because you won&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to. Then in turn your friends who are left will start to drop off because they miss you and don&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to, etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m slowly but surely reducing the number of people who I have listed as &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; on Facebook. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I have less&amp;#0160;fewer&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, but just that I&amp;#39;m tiring of reading updates from people who I barely know as though I were a real-life friend of theirs.
This ends up being a slow and tedious task since the user interface doesn&amp;#39;t have an easy one-click unfriend from a long list - instead you have to go to each stranger-friend in turn, select a drop-down menu, and scroll to the bottom of it to make your &amp;quot;friendship&amp;quot; go away.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s really quite simple to open up a Hubbard squash or any other big tough squashes.
Put the squash in a paper bag, lift it up high, and let it drop onto a hard concrete floor. I went down to the basement and dropped it from the ceiling. Once the squash has been cracked open, it generally can be cut into further smaller pieces without much ado.&amp;#0160;
The various suggestions to hit the thing with an axe, a mallet, or other sharp or blunt instrument, or even to use a knife to start the process are quite inefficient compared to the wonderful force of gravity that can be at your command in this process.</description>

From a news release from Carol Sun of Eastern Accents.&amp;#0160;
Eastern Accents will be closing its doors for good at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 16, 2013 (end of the day). &amp;#0160;A long-simmering dispute with our landlord has finally come to a head, and we’ve decided that it is time for change.

Coconut fried rice
 Leftover rice Coconut oil Dessicated (dried) coconut flakes or powder Milk (I used almond milk to make this vegan) Sugar  Heat oil in pan. Add leftover rice and dried coconut flakes. Mix and stir and cook. When the mixture is hot, add some milk. Sprinkle sugar on top to taste. Stir until hot; you&amp;#39;ll know when it&amp;#39;s done when the dried coconut doesn&amp;#39;t taste dry.</description>

      <description>As monitored from Seismic Network Operations, IC MDJ, Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, China, this is an earthquake signature characteristic of nuclear testing. Or so that&amp;#39;s the working assumption: North Korea is doing nuclear testing.
What follows will be links, because I don&amp;#39;t know any more about this than what I find out from the media.
Nuclear Test Facility, Google Plus. This pinpoints the test facility, and gives its address as Nuclear Test Rd, North Hamgyong, North Korea.</description>

      <description>Originally from Kate and Lynne, this recipe depends on red lentils (not green lentils) and generally can be made with ingredients already in stock in our house. Serve with pita and labneh (if you can manage to not eat all of the pita and labneh before dinner), and with a chopped green salad with a sumac vinagrette.
Middle Eastern Red Lentil Soup  1 medium yellow onion chopped 2 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed 1 T olive oil 1 and 1/2 C red lentils (NOT brown) 8 C water 1 t salt fresh ground pepper 1 T ground cumin lemon juice, to taste  In a big pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until the onion is soft.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m trying my best to track every bill that affects Freedom of Information Act laws in Michigan.
The method runs as follows:
1. Go to the Michigan Legislative Website, where bills and their status are shown.
2. Search bill text for &amp;quot;Freedom of information&amp;quot;.
3. Note with (dismay? amazement?) that 14 bills are found, 4 on the Senate side, 10 on the House side. Realize that this includes legislation that refers to FOIA laws but does not change them.</description>

      <description>In the early 1950s, Ann Arbor had only one public high school. A new high school was proposed and built on former University of Michigan land in the outskirts of Ann Arbor at the corner of Main Street and West Stadium Boulevard, diagonally across from the Michigan Stadium. (The land was formerly the Stadium Hills golf course.) Mahlon Buell, a physics teacher in the high school (1922-58), was an amateur photographer, and he filmed the the project from concept to completion.</description>

      <description>A bunch of folks met for lunch on Thursday. Here&amp;#39;s some notes from that meeting.
I asked people how they stayed warm. They dress in layers, use solar thermal heating, wear sweaters, wear hats, huddle under electric blankets, and all manner of good adaptive Michigan behavior.
Some events coming up, each of which features some a2b3 group member. Some details elided in the interests of brevity, click to links for more details.</description>

      <description>The cold overnight temperatures in the Ann Arbor area are illustrated nicely by the Weather Underground&amp;#39;s Wundermap for the area - here&amp;#39;s a snapshot from 12:30 a.m. Brrr!
Assuming that school is on tomorrow (and not called off because of bitter cold), this should be one of the few days of the year I don&amp;#39;t just send my second grader off to make it to school on his own.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on a 30 day trial of Contactually, a contact manager that seems to handle one important function only: reminding you to follow up periodically with people who are important to you.
On the plus side, it does a good job of importing data from my Google account and from a handful of social media sites, and by doing so the amount of manual labor needed to do something with it is kept to a minimum.</description>

      <description>All news clippings are from early Thursday, January 17, 2013.
From NPR, the FAA is grounding 787s because of battery problems:
The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered the U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 planes to be grounded, citing an incident in Japan earlier today in which one of the jet&amp;#39;s batteries emitted smoke. The Japanese report came a week after a similar incident occurred in Boston.
What kinds of problems? Not just smoke, but hot chemicals, according to the Seattle Times:</description>

      <description>Not so much &amp;quot;where did I put my glasses&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;how do I make sure that I find something the next time I&amp;#39;m looking for it online&amp;quot;. A piece of it is also &amp;quot;how do other people find it when they&amp;#39;re looking for it&amp;quot;, but for this exercise it&amp;#39;s the personal search pattern and not the global search pattern that matters.
My current workflow admits multiple patterns for doing this, and I suspect that the answer to my question is to do more than one save, depending on how important it is to save something.</description>

      <description>Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &amp;quot;social graph&amp;quot;. Techmeme&amp;#39;s front page has plenty of commentary.
I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:
 For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&amp;#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled.</description>

A photograph from the reporter shows smoke billowing out of a window.

      <description>Apropos the story of MTS running on tiny hardware, I&amp;#39;ve been musing about what it would take for modern software to consider itself a spiritual heir to the MTS online conferencing system Confer, written by Bob Parnes. I spent a lot of time on Confer in my misspent college days, and most of what I think about online communications is somehow influenced by that system.
Confer is a structured communications system, in that there is a definite distinction between the first message in a conversation thread (the &amp;quot;item&amp;quot;) and the subsequent responses.</description>

      <description>I organize lunch every week on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in downtown Ann Arbor. About 400 people get some kind of invitation, and attendance varies from 6 to 25+. (One week we filled the restaurant, which was just a little bit scary.)
This week&amp;#39;s crowd was good - I counted 18 seats - and the question of the week was asking people to talk about the job they had in college.</description>

      <description>Connecting William Street is a redevelopment project that the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is working on to make better use of properties which are currently surface parking lots. The grand plan envisions relatively dense development on these lots.
For background reading see the DDA site for Connecting William Street, the AnnArbor.com coverage of Connecting William Street, and &amp;#0160;the Ann Arbor Chronicle coverage of Connecting William Street. If you&amp;#39;re coming at it from scratch, expect to spend about an hour chewing on the debates to date.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m irritated when so-called newspapers fill their pages by rewriting stories from other newspapers. It&amp;#39;s worst when the rewrite is as long as the original and contains no new reporting, just regurgitage.
A typical example:
Dexter Patch writes a story about the township losing out to another bidder on land for a new fire station. AnnArbor.com follows up with the same story, too lazy even to call any of the officials named in the story to get its own quote.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s assume for a moment that the Internet is a very large, elaborate, multi-player game. What are its winning conditions?  0. Make money fast. That proves to be difficult, but it&amp;#39;s been pitched so many times that it should go up front first. If you can&amp;#39;t make money quickly, then at least make the promise that you are growing something that will eventually make money even if it&amp;#39;s not making money now.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;#39;t run on 10.5.8, so I&amp;#39;m holding this review until after I upgrade to 10.6.
It didn&amp;#39;t work on 10.6.8 either, just coming up with a &amp;quot;Loading&amp;quot; screen that hangs their seemingly forever. I&amp;#39;m on an early 2008 MacBook, certainly not the fastest computer in the world, but one that is usually adequate to the task of running most software.
After prompt help from Bluestacks tech support, I tried again, this time first closing my Chrome browser windows before starting.</description>

      <description>There is a tremendous appeal to the deletionist point of view.  I spent some time this evening improving Wikipedia by suggesting that some of its less well written articles be removed. The task was relatively simple; hit the &amp;quot;random page&amp;quot; button, read the article, decide if it is so horrible as to be unencyclopedic, and if it is then paste in the &amp;quot;please delete this&amp;quot; template and hope for the best.</description>

      <description>A France-based school of writing called &amp;quot;Oulipo&amp;quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is an entire novel written missing a letter &amp;quot;e&amp;quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&amp;#39;s end, you are just amazed it&amp;#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format.  A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &amp;quot;h&amp;quot; key on my keyboard.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details.  I&amp;#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&amp;#39;s stumped me before. I&amp;#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked.  The key bit which I didn&amp;#39;t use before was a screwdriver.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I started using Github as an issue tracker to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&amp;#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&amp;#39;s some reflection on that use.  I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order.</description>

      <description>Technology upgrades are a tedious but necessary task.  I&amp;#39;m going through this now, with an upgrade from Mac OS 10.5.8 to Mac OS 10.6.8 on my black MacBook. The world decided in its infinite wisdom that 10.5 was too old to keep supporting, and so quite a bit of software was starting to break. The promise is that 10.6.x will last a bit longer and keep my old 2008 vintage system running for a while longer.</description>

      <description>750 words has a system of point scoring that lets you keep track of how vigorously you have been pursuing your writing goals. This is very similar to the kinds of other daily projects I have been involved in like various pedometer games with goals of daily walking activity or language learning that prompts you for daily use.  Working on something every single day is hard. There are only so many hours in a day, and the commitment to do one thing at the exclusion of something else is a big one.</description>

      <description>This system has you writing 750 words each day.   I&amp;#39;ve already written 750 words today, a long essay on blogging, forgetting, and remembrance. It was pretty good, and I was pretty happy with it. At one point it was 830 words but I cut it down to size, removing a paragraph and tightening up a few phrases.  The goal of the 750 words site is to get you into a habit of writing that many words each and every day.</description>

      <description>750 words on blogging, memory and forgetting
I&amp;#39;ve been blogging for a long time, and writing online for longer than that - 27 years of typing. In the process, a lot of it has been saved, and a lot of it has been discarded. I&amp;#39;m luckier than most to have a complete set of my writing since 2003 all in Typepad. Heaven help anyone who wrote seriously on Prodigy or Compuserve or Facebook and tried to save any of it permanently.</description>

      <description>My friend Pete Kaminski suggests (on a private Facebook forum) that there are two reasons that Facebook has taken a big chunk of our online social time - &amp;quot;ubiquity&amp;quot;, which is the character of providing global communications at scale, and &amp;quot;focus&amp;quot;, which is the ability to narrow your personal interest discussions down to a small set of topics. For all of its other charms, Facebook provides both of those, imperfectly of course but well enough that it can serve as a does-everything social platform for lots of people.</description>

  Established in 2003 to bring pride and recognition to the trade, Lineman Barn is the First Choice of Linemen and their families for custom shirts, hats, decals, gifts, JOBS and Lineman Safety News.  Part of the news that gets circulated is information about power outages, in the form of calls for linemen to work at utility companies.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m struggling with the single user nature of this Android tablet. My kids are complaining that they don&#39;t want all of the interruptions and notifications from the apps that I have installed. Frankly I agree with them, a Facebook window just popped up when I was writing this. It would be easier if the front unlock screen was a real login screen.</description>

      <description>The boys got D2 pads (http://d2pad.info) for Hanukah. Here&amp;rsquo;s a 250 word long review of this 7&amp;rdquo; Android tablet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to compare against. The experience so far recommends it as a handy adjunct to a full-size computer for some tasks, and it makes me more confident in my hunch that an Android phone is going to be my next phone.</description>

      <description>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.
The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&amp;#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.
Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&amp;#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing.</description>

      <description>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&amp;#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way.</description>

      <description>The phrase &amp;quot;task surfing&amp;quot; came to me, and I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what it means.
The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&amp;#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&amp;#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&amp;#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&amp;#39;s not that.</description>

      <description>Students and teachers from the photography class at Marquette Alternative High School (MAHS) create a calendar each year. The project showcases their work and funds a field trip for the students. This year&amp;#39;s 2013 calendar features pictures of Marquette, the butterfly house on Mackinac Island, and the DeYoung Family Zoo in Wallace. The cost is $20 and it&amp;#39;s available for sale online.
Proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to photo equipment and to a photo field trip - the butterfly museum photos are from last year&amp;#39;s trip.</description>

Usually the effort is temporary, with one system working really well as I download all of my tasks out of my inbox and into it, and then slowly languishing until it fails for some mysterious reason to actually get me to do things more efficiently.
You only need to look at my productivity category here to marvel at how ideas come and go.</description>

Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.
The examples that come to mind share some common traits.
 there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least.</description>

In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.

It&amp;#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few coffee shops that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the flyers collection lets you see what&amp;#39;s on the bulletin boards around town.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Patricia F. Anderson for this non-summary of the November 29, 2012 A2B3 lunch at Eastern Accents.&amp;#0160;
Hi, folk!
Yesterday saw a decent sized group for lunch, roughly a dozen.&amp;#0160;Conversation was, as usual, fascinating and diverse.
General conversation included the search for a proper formalmythological &amp;quot;Muse&amp;quot; or Goddess as a kind of patron saint of geeks and&amp;#0160;code monkeys. A suggestion was Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of
measurement, mathematics, and librarianship, known for her&amp;#0160;seven-pointed headdress and leopardskin dress.</description>

      <description>Via Viral Viral Videos:
 Long Island hit music station 106.1 BLI ... made this genius Long Island Power Authority spoof of the KPop mega hit with their own relevant lyrics, all pertaining to the recent mass power outages due to hurricane Sandy. Naturally, the music video is instantly going viral!
&amp;#0160;
  Add this to your list of parodies of this hit - my other favorite is &amp;quot;Klingon Style&amp;quot;, and my younger son was singing along to &amp;quot;Mitt Romney Style&amp;quot; the other day.</description>

      <title>How many signs did the City of Ann Arbor remove from the right of way in 2012?</title>

      <description>The City of Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Community Standards Department routinely removes signs from the right of way when someone puts something there that doesn&amp;#39;t belong. This might be an advertising sign, a political yard sign, or something else that fits the bill. The city&amp;#39;s sign ordinance sets the standards.
I asked the city in a FOIA request to give me more information about sign removals, and after we went back and forth a while to get a request that was easy to fill, here&amp;#39;s what I got: a count of the number of signs removed each month.</description>

      <description>Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Stadium Bridges are reopening on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 after about a year of being closed for reconstruction, according to messages from the city. The latest information that I have is that the bridge will open at 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but that there will be intermittent lane closures for the rest of the week to finish up the job. City engineer Mike Nearing emailed me to say that &amp;quot;at least one sidewalk will be open while our contractor works to clean and finish the work on the roadway and bridges.</description>

      <description>A Death Cafe is a safe place where people get together to talk about death and have tea and delicious cake. The idea originated in Switzerland as the &amp;quot;cafe mortel&amp;quot;, is organized from the UK, and has spread to France, Australia and the US. Events are low key, held in public places, and are safe and informal.&amp;#0160;
The Ann Arbor Death Cafe is the first of these events to be held in Michigan.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m being followed (on Twitter) by a twenty pound carp - and not just any old carp, but a&amp;#0160;cyprinid philosopher-fish.
This particular carp - and it&amp;#39;s a distinctive carp, having been transported from its west side retention pond hood into the Waters of the State, namely the mighty Huron River - is a keen observer of riparian life, a stalwart proponent of local governance, and an aspiring banjo player. A carp of constant sorrow.</description>

The forecast for tonight from the University of Alaska suggests that the aurora may be visible as far south as Lansing, Michigan. From my Pinterest maps board:

I don&amp;#39;t try to make Pinterest a simple copy of anything else that I do online, in part because there&amp;#39;s really nothing similar to it to copy. It&amp;#39;s ridiculously easy to make a copy of an image and attach a few words to it, and there&amp;#39;s not any real problem with posting too much stuff to it because when you&amp;#39;re on topic it all just flows down the page nicely.</description>

      <description>I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective?
One suggestion, from long-time blogger Prentiss Riddle, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks.</description>

      <description>Writing this up to support a bug report, please excuse the technical intrusion.
When I use the blockquote function in the Typepad editor, there&amp;#39;s a sequence of steps that causes me to lose text out of the editor.
A series of screen captures follows. The general pattern runs like this:
 create three paragraphs select the second paragraph, and blockquote it; the third paragraph blockquotes as well switch to HTML view to confirm that the blockquote includes two paragraphs switch back to rich text reselect the second paragraph, and unblockquote it; nothing seems to happen switch to HTML view; the second and third paragraphs are not there reswitch to rich text, the second and third paragraphs disappear  I&amp;#39;m using Chrome 21 on MacOS 10.</description>

      <description>I think I voted today.
I used the Automark machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&amp;#39;ve used this machine before many times, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator.</description>

Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.

&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;You are not your user.&amp;quot; The importance of talking to your users. The book &amp;quot;Design of Everyday Things&amp;quot;, 1986 as a watershed event. Everyone understands this now, so &amp;quot;we won&amp;quot;. But what does victory look like?
&amp;#0160;Less of an information architect, more of an information therapist.
Reports from the user research group; information about site search analytics (in another group); logs from the call center (yet another group); reports from web analytics applications (yet another group); also &amp;quot;Voice of the Customer&amp;quot; (survey research); CRM applications like Salesforce; papers from a research center; papers from the net; a &amp;quot;mental model&amp;quot; diagram; brand architecture research; net promoter score (survey research).</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &amp;quot;snor&amp;#39;eastercane&amp;quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;nor&amp;#39;easter&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;hurricane&amp;quot;. Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name.
 Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.
 The Twitter hashtag is #snoreastercane and is in use already, with comments like this from @LoriG: &amp;quot;Unexpected consequence of global warming: having to learn the names of a bunch of new types of storms&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>It started as two email messages in quick succession: both the City of Ann Arbor and the AATA reported that their phone service was out, due to a &amp;quot;regional outage&amp;quot;. How bad is this outage, and what&amp;#39;s the cause?
I did some searching and came across the very useful &amp;quot;outages&amp;quot; mailing list, where network operations staff goes to share network down problems. This pointed at Windstream as the source of the network problems, and expanded the scope of the problems well beyond Ann Arbor.</description>

      <description>How many votes should you cast when you are voting in a contest which has multiple candidates? Consider a ballot with 5 candidates for 4 spots, where you can pick any 4 of 5. You&amp;#39;re wildly enthusiastic about 2 candidate, neutral on 1 candidates, and opposed to 2 candidates. Here are your choices:
1. Undervote the ticket, casting only 2 votes for your favorites and leaving 3 votes behind.
2. Undervote the ticket, casting votes for your favorites and the neutral, leaving 2 votes behind.</description>

      <description>THE L.A. Times has a great story about a map collection that is going to the Los Angeles Public Library after the collector died, leaving no heirs.
 Stashed everywhere in the 948-square-foot tear-down were maps. Tens of thousands of maps. Fold-out street maps were stuffed in file cabinets, crammed into cardboard boxes, lined up on closet shelves and jammed into old dairy crates.
 The find included all sorts of rare materials - here&amp;#39;s only a partial list:</description>

      <description>I had my first chance to sit at the new Elixir Vitae cafe on East Liberty today. The store is one of two with that name, after the Cafe Ambrosia store on Maynard Street changed its name. (Same ownership, just a new name, because of conflicts with too many other coffee businesses called Ambrosia).
Some impressions:
There&amp;#39;s a lot more sunshine in the new cafe than there ever was in the old one.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;#39;s earnings announcement came out early today, with a mis-step by financial printer R.R. Donnelly blamed for the early release which included boilerplate text &amp;quot;PENDING LARRY QUOTE&amp;quot; at the top instead of an actual quote from Google founder Larry Page. The press release is here, though I fully expect the text to be altered before too long. Earnings did not meet estimates.
The internet, quick to jump on a catch phrase, has come up with a pending Larry quote tumblr blog.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor City Council holds meetings twice each month, which are streamed online through the city&amp;#39;s CTN network. I tuned in last night on my laptop to listen and watch.
While I was listening, I had a few other windows open on my computer. First and foremost, I had a twitter stream that I was watching for the #a2council&amp;#0160;hash tag; that caught commentary from a few other people who were watching at home, plus some reporters in the audience.</description>

Flat leaf parsley
Radishes
Sweet potatoes
Sweet red peppers
The market was busy and there was a full set of vendors under the covered awnings, but no one in the sand lot.</description>

      <description>Mark this down under &amp;quot;things to be sure to do next October&amp;quot; -
The 5th annual, 2012 Lake Orion Pumpkin Launch was a blast. It was held at Orion Oaks park, about 90 minutes from Ann Arbor. Five teams competed to launch pumpkins with trebuchets out into a field. The winning team, the Masters of Mayhem, lobbed a pumpkin over 1300 feet (a quarter of a mile).

      <title>Listening to five channels of CBC Radio 2</title>

      <description>CBC&amp;#39;s Radio 2 has 5 channels of online music going at any time, reflecting the need to provide programming from the Atlantic Time Zone to the Pacific Time Zone. Newfoundland, a half hour east of the Atlantic Time Zone, gets a shout out from time to time but not its own time slot.
It&amp;#39;s nice to have a choice of five channels, because sometimes you want to have mid-day classical music, and some days you want to have afternoon popular music, and in this way you can just time-shift your listening all from the same page.</description>

      <description>Arborwiki is a local encyclopedia about the Ann Arbor area that anyone can edit. Up til now, it&amp;#39;s been running on the same Mediawiki software that powers Wikipedia, but we&amp;#39;re in the process of moving it to a new Localwiki instance.
Localwiki is wiki software designed especially for using in city wikis. It&amp;#39;s based off of ideas learned from DavisWiki, a very successful wiki based in Davis, California. The Localwiki software is especially good at handling maps, and so it should be that much easier to map out the streets and roads of Ann Arbor and surrounding Washtenaw County.</description>

      <description>As I listen to a plane go overhead today, I remember how quiet it was here in Ann Arbor after 9/11 when the entire US airspace was shut down. You could hear the birds a lot more easily, and the sky was clear.
Here&amp;#39;s what I wrote at the time:
 A fighter jet made a circle over the center of campus as [we]&amp;#0160;were heading downtown, the only plane in the sky the whole day.</description>

Chicago teachers are on strike. The Chicago Tribune&amp;#39;s live blog of the strike&amp;#0160;notes that 144 locations are open to handle kids that get free lunches and breakfasts, and that the CTA is offering free fares to students to get to those schools.</description>

In honor of this day a couple of nice photos of Marquette, MI came via Shorpy. The photos of the harbor and ore docks, Front Street, and a panorama of downtown Marquette&amp;#0160;date from 1908 and 1909 and are from glass negatives from the Detroit Publishing Company.</description>

      <description>This graph measures water levels downstream from Argo Dam. Water levels are not supposed to fluctuate this much - it&amp;#39;s not good for the river.
More data at the USGS.
Update: I checked with USGS to make sure that the gauges were working fine, and got back this result:
We&amp;#39;re pretty certain everything is working just fine there. I believe we have a hydrologic technician there today making a streamflow measurement and he&amp;#39;ll verify the operation of the equipment at the same time.</description>

The second day at our house featured a last-minute lunch prep (mac and cheese) and then two bicycle rides, one each for the 7th grader and for the 2d grader. The Burns Park school grounds were busy with a stream of parents and kids coming for dropoff; I haven&amp;#39;t seen the new Summers-Knoll morning rush yet.</description>

      <description>Hurricane Isaac brought with it high winds and a substantial amount of rain, and both of those combined has led to a lot of flooding. Here are some maps I&amp;#39;ve collected while the storm is still underway. You should know that for each of them I&amp;#39;ll also give a link to the underlying mapping source so that you can get current information.
If you are in the affected area and need details about flooded roads or the risk of dams or levees bursting or anything else, do not trust this weblog for current information; seek out official and up to date sources.</description>

      <description>From the news release:
The&amp;#0160;Gallery Project presents&amp;#0160;Quantified Self, a multimedia exhibit in which 34 local, regional, and national artists examine how individuals collect and often project information about themselves and others in the digital world. Artists examine the quantified self from two unique perspectives: one, how information about individuals is collected, stored, processed, and used by these individuals and communicated to others; and two how entities collect information about individuals and groups for commercial and other purposes.</description>

      <description>Each year is a new hurricane season, and each year the internet is a little different. Here&amp;#39;s some things that are new that I&amp;#39;ve noticed.
Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&amp;#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&amp;#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come. The word of the year is &amp;quot;spaghetti model&amp;quot;, illustrated below, showing a whole series of separate tracks from different atmospheric models to predict a set of possible futures for the storm.</description>

      <description>For the most part, I don&amp;#39;t comment on newspaper web sites any more; it&amp;#39;s generally more effective to engage by writing the same message directly to the reporter or to the editor.
In some cases, good results can also be had by sending messages directly to the parties involved in the story, and cc&amp;#39;ing (or bcc&amp;#39;ing) the reporter in question.

      <title>When the boys bring home trout from the trout farm, there&#39;s no question that it&#39;s trout for dinner.</title>

      <description>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect.
The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&amp;#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this video from &amp;quot;battlebauble&amp;quot; on YouTube looks convincing.</description>

      <description>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m eating a sandwich&amp;quot;.) Here&amp;#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.
From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &amp;quot;Interpreting some of Twitter&amp;#39;s API changes&amp;quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m working on a lot of things, or so it seems, but right now I just want to write.
The working environment at the moment is the Chrome browser, with 6 tabs open. Two are Gmail accounts, one is Twitter, one is the Typepad dashboard from which I&amp;#39;m writing this, and one is a Google Analtyics window set to &amp;quot;real time&amp;quot; view for Arborwiki. A sixth tab is currently on Google search, but it varies from time to time.</description>

      <description>How many people do you need to know before it&amp;#39;s likely that two have the same full name?
The answer is going to depend critically on the pool of people you are sampling from, and whether you count people in multiple generations as Sr., Jr. as &amp;quot;same name&amp;quot;. Similarly, middle initials or middle names will be distinguishing marks. What I&amp;#39;m after is less about collisions within a family and more about two John Jones in your addressbook, otherwise completely unrelated.</description>

      <description>After writing about power problems that affected thousands of homes, it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine a problem that would take out 700 million subscribers. But that&amp;#39;s just the problem facing India, which has seen failures of its transmission grid in two days straight - the biggest power outage ever.

      <description>Microcoworking is independent workers and freelancers working together at the same time in a coffee shop, sharing ideas and conversation. It&amp;#39;s more informal than the coworking facilities that have sprung up all over the country, but it shares with them the idea that just because you&amp;#39;re working on your own you don&amp;#39;t have to be alone.

      <description>According to Facebook, none of my friends have a birthday today. How many friends do I have to have so that there&amp;#39;s a 50/50 chance that there will be a birthday every day of the year?
An answer comes from the blog Math Goes Pop!, referencing the well known &amp;quot;coupon collector&amp;#39;s problem&amp;quot;.
What’s known about this problem? Well, as I said above, even if you buy hundreds of thousands of cards, or stuff millions of people in a room, there’s no guarantee that you’ll collect every card or every date.</description>

      <description>This is a corollary to Steve Fuller&amp;#39;s observation
 Public ignorance thus ascends to the meta-level of not knowing the expert system in which the relevant expertise is contained.
 It&amp;#39;s worse than that, of course - the system that has the goods is something you used to understand, but don&amp;#39;t anymore, and thus you are ignorant about the very expertise that you once had.

      <description>The West Shore Pipeline carries refined fuels from refineries near the southern end of Lake Michigan north to Green Bay, and from there fuel is carried by truck to the Upper Peninsula.
A spill on this pipeline near Milwaukee led to it being shut down for a time this week, and even though the pipeline is back in operation, the effects linger in the form of a fuel shortage in the UP.</description>

The 2012 Michigan hay crop is not looking good, due to widespread drought conditions. From Michigan State Extension:
 The dry weather of 2012 has left most livestock producers in the Midwest scrambling for more hay. First cutting hay yields were down 20 – 40 percent in much of Michigan and with the dry weather intensifying, total hay yields for the year could be off by 50 percent or more.</description>

      <description>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for Kedgeree - last night. I don&amp;#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close.
 2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee 1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt, pepper fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch hard boiled eggs for garnish  The method runs roughly as follows.</description>

      <description>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&amp;#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&amp;#39;s going on in real time. This is helped by the live simulcast of Ann Arbor City Council meetings on CTN, the city&amp;#39;s cable access television feed, as well as online.
There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary.</description>

      <description>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.
The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&amp;#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&amp;#39;t remember it either).</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR (June 29, 2012) An intense storm called a derecho with long lived straight line winds passed to the south of the area today. The Disaster Mapping weblog entry 6/29/2012 Derecho has a good summary of the impact to the power grid from storm, which had knocked out power to over 3 million people as of 11:45 p.m from Illinois all the way to DC. Wind gusts of over 90 miles per hour were clocked in some areas as the storm blew through.</description>

      <description>From UVA Today:
 June 26, 2012 — The University of Virginia&amp;#0160;Board of Visitors&amp;#0160;today voted unanimously to reinstate Teresa A. Sullivan as president.
University Rector Helen E. Dragas apologized for actions that sparked the controversy and pledged that she will work with Sullivan to capture the energy from the events of the past three weeks to address the issues confronting the University.
 The University of Virginia Libraries is documenting this turn in the power struggle at UVA, which saw Sullivan ousted from her post by the Board of Visitors.</description>

      <description>As part of my search for work in Ann Arbor, I&amp;#39;ve been compiling a list of employers who maintain lists of open opportunities on their web sites. You can see the list here
http://arborwiki.org/city/Jobs
As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.
There&amp;#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide.</description>

      <description>1. Read and study How to win at Bejeweled, a LiveJournal thread which goes over a set of strategies and tactics. In brief: avoid losing, work from the top down, avoid things that blow up, and build hypercubes.
2. Learn from that scene in War Games. &#34;The only way to win is not to play.&#34;

      <description>From a book by Patrick Wilson, as referenced by Soo Young Rieh in a conversation we had last week. Consider that this was written before the appearance of both Wikipedia and Google, and ask yourself how each one appears to be both universal and authoritative in its recommendations.
&amp;quot;An authority on authorities is one who can be trusted to to tell us who can be trusted.... A universal authority on authoritie would be one who could be trusted to tell us who else can be trusted, in all possible spheres; such a person would be potentially an authority on everything, for if he could identify the authorities in any sphere, he could in principle find out what they claim to know and so inform himself on any subject whatever, and subsequently inform us.</description>

For local coverage, the Duluth News Tribune&amp;#0160;(Twitter: @duluthnews) is a good source for detail. Minnesota Public Radio put together a stunning set of photos of the Duluth floods, including a picture of a seal that washed away from the Duluth Zoo (the seal is OK).</description>

There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world.

I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&amp;rsquo;s, and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home.</description>

Ars Technica reports that the Flame virus uses a previously undiscovered attack on the MD5 cryptographic hash in order to carry out some of its devious work.&amp;#0160;

Here&amp;#39;s a map of the telemetry that was visible through APRS.FI&amp;#0160;for the duration of the launch. The device is identified as KC8SBA. Note that for some reason tracking didn&amp;#39;t pick up until a few minutes after the launch, and the tracking was also silent for a while until just before the descent.</description>

      <description>There are a couple of good sites for information about do-it-yourself washing machine repair. Ours had a leak, which I think I traced to a tiny hole in the low-pressure drain hose that was fixable with a pipe tape that the good folks at Stadium Hardware helped me find. Let&amp;#39;s hope the repair holds!
I used the Family Handyman&amp;#39;s How To Repair a Leaking Washing Machine&amp;#0160;as my guide. The pinhole sized leak was in the middle of the low-pressure drain hose, where a rusty piece of bracket had wedged itself against the hose and slowly caused it to get a pinhole sized hole.</description>

News emerged on Wednesday, June 6, 2012 that LinkedIn had a leak of its password database. This was confirmed as a number of security researchers identified their own password hashes in the file, as well as a number of cracked passwords from that file that had the string &amp;quot;LinkedIn&amp;quot; or some variant in the text. You can protect yourself by changing your LinkedIn password, and by also changing any other passwords that you use which are the same.</description>

It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey.</description>

      <description>Two views of the Wisconsin recall election, in which Governor Scott Walker (R) survived a challenge from Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett (D). With 93% of precincts counted, Walker leads 54% to 45%.
The&amp;#0160;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel results map&amp;#0160;shows who won which county:

TheNew York Times coverage also shows the margin of victory, which puts the map into stark relief:

Compare this with theless clear Huffington Post interactive recall results margin graphic, which shows percentage size of lead on a county by county basis; that over-weights the color of rural counties, and underestimates the size of the urban difference in the total vote count.</description>

      <description>Some notes for this evening&amp;#39;s transit of Venus across the Sun.
University Lowbrow Astronomers has a page full of Venus transit information for Ann Arbor area locals, including viewing parties at local observatories and at the Traverwood Library. The Great Lakes Association of Astronomy Clubs has a similar list of Venus transit viewing sites statewide if you want to meet up with others while watching.
 Depending on your location, the 2012 transit will take place either June 5 or June 6.</description>

      <description>Why oh why can&amp;#39;t we have a&amp;#0160;better press corps?
I am sure that all this “you’re doing it wrong” media criticism hearkens back to a golden era of competition in journalism, so bully for you all&amp;#0160;in stirring up a Newhouse/funhouse fight.
Perhaps instead of throwing up wadded old balls of newsprint at each other you could both get back to focus on accurate attention to details, expressed concisely enough to be grasped.</description>

      <description>The problem with unreliable networks is that you have to engineer extra hard to be able to make use of them, and you still can&amp;#39;t rely on them even when you do.
Consider the network connection that&amp;#39;s randomly working and not working. If the network were actually down, you could work with that, knowing that eventually it would be a time and place that you could reconnect. Until then you stay offline in airplane mode and just chill and enjoy it.</description>

      <description>My Mac is in the shop. It&amp;#39;s getting a new wifi card, and while they are at it they&amp;#39;ll replace the chipped case. The chip fixing means that labor is free for the wifi fixing so it&amp;#39;s a very reasonable cost.
The last time I had any kind of extended computer downtime I remember it being a strain, since I then had so much of my personal computing stuff actually on my computer.</description>

 &amp;quot;A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn&amp;#39;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.&amp;quot; Leslie Lamport, 1987; though the same observation would be true for cloud computing today.  &amp;#0160;

      <description>There&amp;#39;s a great song by The Horse Flies, called &amp;quot;Roadkill&amp;quot;, with the memorable line &amp;quot;eat what you kill&amp;quot;. This is from their live show at the Grassroots Festival, 1993:

You&amp;#39;ll find more Horseflies tunes on the Internet Archive from their live shows. Look for their other seasonally appropriate tune &amp;quot;I live where it&amp;#39;s gray&amp;quot;. I haven&amp;#39;t yet heard their latest album Until The Ocean. (Amazon link).</description>

      <description>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:
 The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
 I can&amp;#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems.</description>

      <description>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &amp;quot;fork&amp;quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge.</description>

      <description>Some sources for information on the Duck Lake Fire, which started on Wednesday, May 23, 2012 and is burning rapidly in Luce County, north of Newberry, MI. The fire is dangerous and has caused evacuations; if you are reading this and you are in the area, seek authoritative and current information from official sources.
The fire brings to mind the 2007 Sleeper Lake Fire&amp;#0160;which burned over 18,000 acres in Luce County.</description>

      <description>Andrew Keen&amp;#39;s Digital Vertigo is a follow-on to his earlier The Cult of the Amateur. Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at Facebook and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful.
With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&amp;#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo.</description>

      <description>Imagine that it&amp;#39;s the year 2020; it&amp;#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?
Something new
One possibility is that people&amp;#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&amp;#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&amp;#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that.</description>

      <description>The early reports from strawberry growers that send out periodic newsletters to their perennial customers is that Michigan strawberries will be early this year. If you normally plan to pick on Father&amp;#39;s Day, you may be too late for the crop.
None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&amp;#39;ll share those when I have them; it&amp;#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day.</description>

      <description>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world.
There&amp;#39;s a lot of talk about a &amp;quot;smart grid&amp;quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes the power does go out, and it&amp;#39;s not always obvious why it did or when the systems will be back online.</description>

      <description>I used the Automark machine to vote today, as I did in 2010 (AnnArbor.com story) and in 2008 (Vacuum post).

This year&amp;#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.
For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me.</description>

      <description>Tonight&amp;#39;s Ann Arbor City Council meeting discussed at great length the expenditure of some sizable sum of money for art that would be installed in the secured lobby of the Justice Center part of City Hall, where would you have to go through a security check to visit it.
What I have noticed from visits to City Hall is that the art that&amp;#39;s there is quite accessible is a tile mural that you can not only see without going through a checkpoint, but is even so ready to hand that you can touch it.</description>

      <description>David Bloom holds forth in song in Off I Go To The County Board, one of the few songs written about the process of covering public meetings.
Off I Go To The County Board,
inspired by Mary Morgan
Off I Go To The County Board,
To hear the rabble bray,
Of taxes met, infractions scored,
On this harumphing day.
 Oh Washtenaw, brave Washtenaw,
Of eighty-three, the best.
The other counties hold in awe,</description>

      <description>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I&#39;m not &#34;producing content&#34;, I&#39;m writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else&#39;s interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges.</description>

Regional Commissioner Charlene Peiffer noted that union members accounted for 17.5 percent of wage and salary workers in Michigan in 2011 compared to 16.5 percent a year earlier. At its peak in 1989, the first year state data were available, Michigan’s union membership rate was 26.</description>

      <description>The Michigan Daily story of April 15, 2012 has an excellent set of photos of MLK&amp;#39;s visit to Ann Arbor on&amp;#0160;November 5, 1962, and the story of how they were discovered.
 David Erdody, a digital curator at the Bentley Historical Library, discovered a series of 20 photo negatives in early January that feature King giving a speech and hosting a discussion at the University. These photographs, which have never been printed or published, depict King speaking and greeting a crowd at Hill Auditorium, attending a small discussion in the Michigan Union and having dinner at the University on Nov.</description>

      <description>A fire at a chemical plant in Japan killed one and injured dozens, according to broadcasts monitored on international shortwave frequencies and Internet news and trade publication sources.

The NHK news includes news of a chemical plant explosion at Mitsui Chemicals&amp;#39; Iwakuni-Ohtake facility, which straddles areas in Yamaguchi and Hiroshima prefectures. The Mitsui Chemicals site&amp;#0160;identifies the site of the plant as&amp;#0160;1-2, Waki 6-chome, Waki-cho, Kuga-gun, Yamaguchi 740-0061, and says the following chemicals are produced there:</description>

As always, for DTE power outage information, the DTE Power Outage map is a place to go. Our old analog meter was replaced by a digital one, so there&amp;#39;s one additional point of non-mechanical failure to watch for. The page onDTE outage claims is worth noting.

      <description>This stop work order on a new Insomnia Cookies store caught my eye tonight as I was walking down South University.

The relevant permits - or the absense of same - can be found in the City of Ann Arbor eTrakit system. As of 3/23/2012, the ones that have been pulled are
COFO12-0037, which I presume is a certificate of occupancy and is &amp;quot;under review&amp;quot;.

In no particular order, we talked about the +a2b3 Amateur Radio Club (with Dan Romanchik as the likely point of contact), since we had a couple of people who were online listening to +Skywarn for the last tornado. There was also good discussion of fruit trees and the impact of unseasonable weather on the fruit crops, and at my end of the table some neat talk about underground clay irrigation systems.</description>

DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.
Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.
Busch&amp;#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky.</description>

      <description>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff.
Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups.</description>

      <description>Personal wikis are a source for endless fascination, and they would lend themselves towards machine learning to the extent that you can imagine personal information management as a machine-assisted process. These are as individualized as snowflakes and about as durable.
Public utility wikis come in a variety of flavors, and don&#39;t always share an equivalent management structure or function. Sometimes there is a very small team of creators and a large periphery of consumers, and it&#39;s possible for a suitably designed personal effort to extend to public use if approached with care.</description>

      <description>A proposal to reform the calendar system, circa 1935, would have simplified the seasons by making every single year have the same calendar, every single quarter have 91 days and 13 Sundays, and every January 1 always fall on a Sunday. Leap years are accomodated with a mid-year extra Saturday, and the end of the year is celebrated as Year End Day, also as an extra Saturday.

This view shows 4 of the 5 trucks that were out on Monday evening, January 2, 2012.
Plow routes are color coded, and plow trucks are numbered. One tip: if you are using Chrome, turn on and off the &amp;quot;label&amp;quot; field to get the trucks to show.
The system is build by Radio Satellite Integrators, and uses ESRI map technology.</description>

 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. failed to check nearly 14 miles of gas distribution pipelines for leaks for up to two decades when it lost track of 16 maps needed to guide mandated safety inspections of its system in eastern Contra Costa County, company officials acknowledged to state regulators Friday.</description>

1. Power outage maps for 50 states. I only really have about 44 states with maps, but the collection is otherwise excellent, and it gets lots of search traffic when there are big storms. Peak storm action of Hurricane Irene and of the Halloween snowstorm that hit the Northeast both saw 3000+ visits per day of people looking for outage maps for their area.</description>

      <description>Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt - marvelous error! -
that I had a beehive
here inside my heart.
And the golden bees
were making white combs
and sweet honey
from all my old failures.
(Antonio Machado, translated by Robert Bly)
Last night I had a dream—
a blessed illusion it was—
I dreamt of a hive at work
deep down in my heart.
Within were the golden bees</description>

      <description>BJ Fogg is hosting an online program in which he encourages people to produce three tiny habits that they can learn to do in the span of a week. One of the ones I&amp;#39;m trying to do, for instance, is to take my medicine after the kitchen is clean. That&amp;#39;s not a huge task - after all, the medicine cabinet is in the kitchen - but it&amp;#39;s one that anchors a little task in a place where I know I can make it happen.</description>

Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.

      <description>Typepad has a very convenient &amp;quot;drafts&amp;quot; folder into which you can write things that aren&amp;#39;t ready for publication yet. My drafts folder is overflowing. I suppose that means that the editor in me is looking forward to reviewing them and sending them back for revisions.
If you wait long enough between the time you write something and the time you publish it, it&amp;#39;s possible that you can make your writing enough better to be worth the wait.</description>

      <description>We got word via telephone this morning before school started that a power outage at Burns Park Elementary School (see map below, from the DTE outage map) has cancelled school for the day. The outage affects over 1400 customers in Burns Park, Lower Burns Park, and along South State Street. I can&#39;t tell from the map whether University of Michigan facilities are also affected, but the report from the dotcom is that traffic signals are also affected along Packard and on East Stadium near the Stadium Bridges project.</description>

 In this great country of ours, one could eat a different sandwich every day of the year—so that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. Here&#39;s A Sandwich a Day, our daily look at sandwiches around the country. Got a sandwich we should check out?
 As a a part of this they note the Grandwich competition in Grand Rapids, where 10 sandwich vendors competed for the best sandwich in town prize.</description>

      <description>[New] technologies are currently being viewed as either substitutes for, or possible augmentations of, human faculties. I argue that the proffered scenarios of computerized ‘help’ for human activities evident in the ubiquitous computing world tends to focus on augmentation of human remembering, with sensors and computer networks archiving vast amounts of data, but neglects to consider what augmentation might mean when it comes to that other human activity, namely, forgetting.

 I agree! There is a serious lack of sandwich reporting on this website. I, for one, love sandwiches. What if all the pet stories were sandwich stories instead? Everyone isn&#39;t into pets, but who doesn&#39;t like sandwiches? Not anyone I want living in my town. PS if [redacted] puts this advice into action, I expect a share of what is sure to be a tremendous surge in profits.</description>

So I will go two new ways
Down your one way street
 A bridge to nowhere
Barriers upend us all
Together we cope
 Confusion arrives
Cars become pedestrians
Can&#39;t wait for State Street!
 Stadium is closed?
The bridge is being torn down?
How do I get home?

      <description>The technical description is from Groundwater and Soil Moisture Conditions from GRACE Data Assimilation, one of the sets of maps available at the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.
 Launched in 2002, NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites are unique in their ability to measure variations in water stored at all levels above and within the land surface (terrestrial water storage). However, the spatial (150,000 km2) and temporal (monthly with a significant time lag) resolutions of the GRACE fields limit their direct applicability for drought assessment.</description>

      <description>Fran has been going through a lot; here&#39;s what I wrote to her tonight.
 Thank you so much for writing your way through your chemo treatments. I don&#39;t often see anyone with such power to look at what is going on and make sense of it, never mind the subject matter. I wish only that I could write with a fraction of a clear mind in such a circumstance.</description>

      <description>My phone is either nearing the end of its useful life, or reaching the start of some new useful life; I&#39;m not sure which.
Its one true calling is as a terminal for Twitter, and that task it does admirably. Everything else is marginal or slow at best. But Twitter and a fast keyboard makes up for all of that.
The phone in question is a Blackberry Pearl with one of those squooshed keyboards that makes typing an adventure but also lets the phone fit into very small places.</description>

      <description>Tasks to take on at the end of filling up a paper notebook.
 Read through the whole thing, copying out the good parts. There are bound to be enough good parts that you want to save and remember some of them, and scanning them in is one way to preserve the rough qualities. Retyping a clean copy with additional notes inspired by the original is another way to manage that same task.</description>

      <description>On the way there, clear roads and what seemed like a quick trip.
At our destination, a gathering of Wolverines to celebrate a victory over Ohio, and many cousins including the once and twice removed varieties.
On the way back, rain, gray, drizzle, more rain, and slow going. A detour through Kalamazoo for fine dining ended up at Denny&#39;s, which means only that my planning next time will be much better.</description>

Geoff Zeiss has a note on the University of Tennessee Power Information Technology Laboratory and its network of power sensors. FNET&amp;#0160;is
 a low-cost, quickly deployable GPS-synchronized wide-area frequency measurement network. High dynamic accuracy Frequency Disturbance Recorders (FDRs) are used to measure the frequency, phase angle, and voltage of the power system at ordinary 120 V outlets. The measurement data are continuously transmitted via the Internet to the FNET servers hosted at the University of Tennessee and&amp;#0160;Virginia Tech.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR (December 5, 2011): There are a number of neighborhoods in Ann Arbor where there are citizens who receive newspapers, and &#34;newspaper-like items&#34;, where the citizen does not pay for the newspaper. We receive a free copy of the Ann Arbor Journal, and there are some neighborhoods where a number of students receive the Wall Street Journal gratis.
Alas, not everyone who gets a free paper opens it up in time for it to be useful, and some of it turns into litter.</description>

      <description>Every so often my world gets influenced by the colors of things that I see, and I find the need to sort by color.
At the moment, I&amp;#39;m sorting a lot of web tabs by the color of the favicon, left to right in a rainbow, with Gmail (red) on the left and Google Calendar (blue) on the right. Surprisingly few violet and indigo favicons, or else they would take the rightmost tabstop; I suspect that if I used Yahoo more, I&amp;#39;d sort the other way.</description>

      <description>Google&#39;s Google Trends, on the UC Davis Pepper Spray incident, characterizes the incident as &#34;mild&#34;. The Boing Boing coverage shows the intensity much better. Perhaps most surprising from a public records standpoint is the lack of official acknowledgement of incidents in the UC Davis police crime logs, where given the size of the event I&#39;d have expected a &#34;crime alert&#34; at the very least.
The courts weigh in on pepper spray as excessive force in Young vs County of Los Angeles.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the Stadium Bridges project are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.
The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign M4-9b.</description>

      <description>A band scan from Ann Arbor, with notes especially on how to get ahold of the station if you like the tunes being played. This list is incomplete, because you can always have a better radio with a better antenna that can pick out one more low power station at the edge of its range. It&#39;s also incomplete, because it only points to stations I&#39;m likely to listen to, and because it&#39;s starting at the left edge of the dial.</description>

      <description>Is a non-disclosure agreement the right agreement to draft for a first meeting with a potential partner, investor, or venture capitalist?
There might be a much more straightforward approach to this, one that does not require as much resolution of ambiguity between the entrepreneur and the VC. Consider the approach where you treat the key information to be protected as a trade secret. The entrepreneur impresses upon the VC the value of the trade secret and the efforts maintained to protect the trade secret by carefully marking all documents which would disclose the trade secret and visibly restricting their distribution.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR, October 25, 2011, 6:00 AM.
Did you see them? The Northern Lights were visible from Ann Arbor at about 10:30 p.m. on October 24, 2011, described by Julie Weatherbee as &#34;giant red areas like someone had set off a red smoke bomb&#34;.
This epic time lapse was captured by lakefxnet as seen from East Martin, Michigan, north of Kalamazoo.

 Once upon a time, there was mybloglog. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.
Google now has a real time version of Google Analytics, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR, October 11, 2011. Residents of North Burns Park gathered at the Friends Meeting House on Hill Street for the annual North Burns Park Association meeting this evening.
The organization announced its new web site, northburnspark.org , which includes a neighborhood calendar, history, photographs of notable homes and a directory of city and civic resources. The webmaster, (who?), was generous in recognizing volunteers who had helped compile and edit text and photography for the site.</description>

This photo is provided courtesy of Mike Nowak (@snackdog) and is used with permission. The Ann Arbor Fire Department cleared the scene just after 11:00 p.m, according to radio monitoring reports.
 Enough smoke was generated by the fire that residents of the nearby Woodbury Gardens complex called for help, and trucks from Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township were seen departing the scene.</description>

Go there to look at it (now; thanks) and then some more ideas:

Quince caramel from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels. I&amp;#39;m not a candy thermometer owner, but it does sound delicious.</description>

Del.icio.us turned into delicious.com, got bought by Yahoo. Some cool people started to work there supporting it.</description>

      <description>I spotted Nickel Plate 765 as it was heading north through Ann Arbor on Tuesday, September 27, 2011. It was easy to recognize from the clouds of black smoke and the distinctive steam whistle.
 This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944.</description>

On Twitter, the #UARS hash tag has a lot of traffic. I&#39;m following @UARS_Reentry and @NASA and that&#39;s enough to get the summary information.
Heavens Above has an orbital display with current location information; you&#39;ll need to refresh periodically.

I turned on the new profile page, and started monkeying around. The most notable part was a nice and very usable timeline that unearthed a few gems from the not so distant past, and that also surfaced a small handful of posts that I was able to delete because I didn&amp;#39;t want to see them again.</description>

      <description>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&amp;#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.

      <description>Running roughly south to north. Several of these web servers are currently under heavy load, so where there are mirrors I&amp;#39;ll note them; in addition, some of the official maps are relatively large PDFs, so in some cases there are simpler to load images available.
Other sites with map collections: Core77, PSA: Hurricane Evacuation Maps; Hurricane Channel evacuation maps collection. &amp;#0160;A consolidated set of evacuation map data is in the FEMA GIS Data Feeds collection, labeled &amp;quot;HSIP Gold &amp;#39;10&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>The Macintosh Battery web page has all you need to know; it was enough detail to properly diagnose a dead battery on a Mac LC III at the University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive. The symptom was that the machine did this:
 With a dead battery, these often fail to start up at all - you may hear the hard drive spin for a moment, but the screen remains black.</description>

      <description>Hurricane Irene is the first major storm of the 2011 season, with a forecast path that is tracking up the US East Coast. The Weather Underground 2011 Hurricane Irene page is a good one page summary of data, and it will be accurate after this page is outdated.
 Hurricane forecasting uses a series of models to estimate the position and intensity of storms. With a system this size, there is uncertainty as to the ultimate storm path, and it&amp;#39;s not uncommon for a 5 day forecast to note that it might be more than 200 miles off course.</description>

It turns out that the game is NP-hard; the The Complexity of Flood-Filling Games&amp;#0160;(from&amp;#0160;Raphael Clifford,&amp;#0160;Markus Jalsenius,&amp;#0160;Ashley Montanaro,&amp;#0160;Benjamin Sach).
I don&amp;#39;t feel so bad about it any more.

      <description>Given a weblog which has been updated sporadically but regularly for a dozen years, the question is, what to write next.
Recent observations indicate that there are two kinds of writing that tend to get lots of traffic over time. One is the post that is extremely timely, where the world is looking for news of an event as it is happening. A timely and informative post on that event will get a burst of search traffic on one day, and then will get no traffic after that.</description>

      <description>There is an instinct, when things go bad, to want to make sense of the situation by putting the fragments of information that you have on a map. Things are going badly around London tonight, and several people are making sense of it the best they can with maps of what is being reported on Twitter as #londonriot.
I&amp;#39;m keeping links to the original sites here, but the maps I&amp;#39;m including are not live embedded versions - click through for those - but rather snapshots of a moment in time.</description>

      <description>A trip to the Goodwill store in Marquete, MI prompted an examination of their media collection. I ignored the piles of CDs, skipped the shelf of LPs, and went to the bin that had cassettes and 8-tracks. For sale at a reasonable price were a handful of 8-track tapes from the 1970s, including a scuffed copy of Billy Joel&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Stranger&amp;quot;. On the video shelves, there were plenty of 1990s vintage VHS tapes and a whole shelf of VHS players stacked up.</description>

      <description>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own.
The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism&amp;#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks.
 Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network.</description>

      <description>At about 3:30 p.m. CEST (about 9:30 a.m. EST) a bomb exploded near the office of the prime minister in central Oslo, damaging buildings, blowing out windows, and causing at least 8 injuries. Reporting from the scene 45 minutes later is still chaotic. I&amp;#39;d rather point you at a coherent narrative, but there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be one yet; here&amp;#39;s some of the details I&amp;#39;ve found from people near the scene.</description>

The service looks like an iTunes which you can play any song that you can find, for free. I haven&amp;#39;t probed the catalog to see how deep it is, but the Beatles and Bob Dylan are represented by cover bands, not the originals. It&amp;#39;s shiny, and the music plays instantly when you click on a song.</description>

To elaborate: Google+ is like Usenet, except with no newsgroups, and most of the control over what you read being done through kill files and keep files. It&amp;#39;s so busy that you can never catch up, and the default group is a combination of rec.</description>

The retailer used Amazon Mechanical Turk to improve the quality of the reviews posted on its own website. Using the&amp;#0160;Find-Fix-Verify pattern, the retailed used Mechanical Turk to examine&amp;#0160;millions&amp;#0160;of product reviews.</description>

      <description>Part of the fun of Google+&amp;#0160;is learning a new system and its new metaphors and mechanisms. The hard concept to wrap your brain around in G+ are &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;, which combine a filter for viewing incoming messages (like Twitter&amp;#39;s lists) and access control for outgoing messages (like Facebook&amp;#39;s private groups). It&amp;#39;s sufficiently confusing that I never really know with any degree of certainty who will read anything I post without thinking about it pretty hard.</description>

      <description>The defining characteristic of the newsroom is the steady sound of dispatch traffic from the police scanner. The newspaper in turn dispatches reporters to cover incidents of note, and relies on its proprietary access to this information to make decisions about what to consider news.
In the presence of internet-ready scanner rebroadcasting systems like Radio Reference, which offers listeners the opportunity to listen to scanner traffic worldwide, the newsroom editor no longer has a proprietary edge on hearing the news first compared to everyone else tuned in.</description>

      <description>As of 9:30 p.m., 7 are dead in shootings in Grand Rapids. The suspect,&amp;#0160;34-year-old Rodrick Shonte Dantzler, has hostages. I&amp;#39;m not going to try to keep up with the news, but here are some links to follow.
UPDATE: at 11:50 p.m. the hostage situation is over, and the suspect is dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

      <title>How late will the train be? Tracking Amtrak</title>

      <description>In summary, the train will be late, and it will be later than you had previously expected it to be late because of delays on the line due to the track owner (Norfolk Southern) restricting the speed of the track user (Amtrak). &amp;#0160;See Amtrak Train Status History for details.
 More discussion is scattered around the net; I found a good thread at this RailroadFan.com site (&amp;quot;Norfolk Southern cuts train speeds&amp;quot;) with some discussion of the various rail infrastructure in the area including the three NS paths from Detroit to Chicago (via the Wabash and via Toledo) making the more direct Michigan Central line less critical for freight use.</description>

Arizona State has a good page on basics of Arizona summer weather, including a discussion of a haboob - a lens-shaped dust cloud associated with a gust front from a thunderstorm.
   The Arizona Republic story on the day after has a good map, showing the spread of the dust storm throughout the southwestern corner of Arizona including Tucson, Yuma, and Phoenix.</description>

      <description>U-Pick Strawberry season in the Ann Arbor area is over; it ended June 29 at Rowe&amp;#39;s, and June 26 at Whittaker&amp;#39;s.
Juneberries are still on the trees, but they are overripe and best left for the birds.
Mulberries are out in full force on the trees and on the sidewalks. Look down for black blotches, then look up for ripe berries.
Blackberries and black raspberries can be found in parks or in the yards of helpful neighbors.</description>

      <description>I was away from my computer for a few days, but still near my Blackberry - a not-so-smart smartphone with a rudimentary web browser that is reminiscent of the finer parts of web browsing circa 1995. It&amp;#39;s even better than 1995 in that the browser is so portable that it can go with you everywhere, and thus can be reasonably expected to be a mobile companion on social network outings.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I have just now gotten access to Google+, so this review is a reflection of other reviews, some personal experience, and a weary view of novelty.
Google+ is out in very limited test. Some small number of well connected people now have access to a new piece of social software from Google, and initial reviews have been generally positive.
How do you assess whether the initial reviews of a system designed for communications are accurate for when the system eventually gets rolled out to a wider audience?</description>

Pedestrian Path (+1). It&amp;#39;s always good to find a way to get from here to there that&amp;#39;s not on any map. The pedestrian path I found connects Needham Road to Amelia Place.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m inventing a new urban game called Walking Around. I&amp;#39;m sure that someone else has invented it already, but reinvention is part of the process of creativity. Here&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s played.
First, you play with a pedometer, which tells you how far you&amp;#39;ve walked during the day. There are a number of systems already for tracking your pedometer usage, including Walker Tracker, Steps, and a bunch of others. Use whatever system that gives you, or just a spreadsheet, to take care of the basic structure of making certain that you count steps daily.</description>

      <description>At what point did &amp;quot;top of mind&amp;quot; get replaced by &amp;quot;top of page&amp;quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&amp;#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.
Some background for context.
The earliest use of the phrase &amp;quot;top of mind&amp;quot; that I can find in a modern context is Alin Gruber&amp;#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share.</description>

From time to time, someone reads Vacuum and comments that the writing looks unpolished and incomplete. Why would you publish this kind of work, which obviously isn&amp;#39;t up to the standards that would let you sell it to someone for use in print? Why wouldn&amp;#39;t you hide it in your notebooks?</description>

      <description>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&amp;#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at discardia.com. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.
For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos.</description>

      <description>After a rough winter, potholes are ubiquitous on Ann Arbor streets. The end of winter marks the beginning of road repair season, and some fraction of the potholes get filled in. The beginning of snow removal season marks the end of road repair season, and the cycle repeats. Annual Google trend lines show most news stories about potholes happen between January and April, as do most searches for potholes.
The technology to repair a pothole is relatively cheap, with a one or two person truck and some hot patch all that is needed to deal with the incident.</description>

      <description>Prediction markets provide a nice, idealized way to use market mechanisms to predict the future. They are a slightly idealized version of an office betting pool and allow small scale bets (real or virtual) on future events. Unlike a real futures market, where you can get guarantees of future performance on things like delivery of gasoline or frozen orange juice, there&amp;#39;s no way that betting on some prospective GOP hopeful will lift your candidate to office.</description>

      <description>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&amp;#39;s Day at Rowe&amp;#39;s in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.
The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends.</description>

      <description>Neurodiversity means accepting those whose various nervous system components behave as generally expected (neurotypical), as well as those whose nervous systems don&amp;#39;t (autism, migraines, scotopic sensitivity, sensory hyperacuity, parkinson&amp;#39;s, ALS, etc.).
 One of the challenges in building an effective team and a useful network of people to work with is to reach out widely enough to reach some people who have a diversity of background and experience. Seek representation from all corners including people from large and small cities, from a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and with diverse religious, cultural, and economic backgrounds.</description>

      <description>The City of Ann Arbor is on a steady path to install LED street lighting. Downtown&amp;#39;s Main Street and the campus entrance along South State Street both have distinctive and highly visible LEDs to illuminate well-travelled corridors.
While it&amp;#39;s clear the LED lights use less energy, it&amp;#39;s not always obvious that they cost less to install and operate for the duration of their expected lifetime. The technology is moving fast enough that next year&amp;#39;s model will top this year&amp;#39;s for the foreseeable future.</description>

      <description>United Airlines is down because of a computer systems crash. Details are minimal as to what has actually happened. Here&amp;rsquo;s some sources.
Chicago: Chicago Breaking News puts the start of the problems at 7:15 p.m. Central (8:15 p.m. Eastern) and reports major problems at O&amp;rsquo;Hare. A later update attributes the first official announcement of the problem as coming from the FAA, not from United.

      <description>The poll is provided through All Our Ideas, which unlike most other polling software is actually useful for writing in that it lets readers come up with their own suggestions and not just pick from a pre-packaged list.
If you are wondering what to cook for dear old Dad, last week&#39;s Pancakes? poll might give you some recipe ideas. It generated 21 ideas with over 200 votes.

      <description>More Father&amp;#39;s Day events! West Park had a major construction project over the last year, and it&amp;#39;s now being unveiled complete with a grand ribbon cutting and the unveiling of the sculpture in the park.
If you were at West Park during the recent monsoon rains you&amp;#39;ll appreciate that quite a bit of work went into stormwater handling, with very visible results.

      <description>The input box on Twitter is very small, the user interface works on a cell phone, and it all feels so much like you are having a small intimate conversation with a few confidants. Something horrible is said and you and perhaps the world realize that this thing is not just a harmless lark.&amp;#0160;
Twitter is a global communications infrastructure, with short meaningful names that replace carrier-assigned numbers for text and picture messaging.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.
The power outage maps I have been collecting started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&amp;#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z.</description>

      <description>I find myself wanting to call people once in a while, and I also find that I know people&amp;#39;s twitter names pretty well.
What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &amp;quot;dial by twitter name&amp;quot; in the sense that there&amp;#39;s no command line prompt that has a &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object.
 % call @vielmetti
 Actually, I&amp;#39;m at even a worse spot; I don&amp;#39;t even have a &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; command to start from at the shell script prompt.</description>

      <description>The weekend is a low email diet, but somehow that&amp;#39;s difficult to do without explaining myself a little bit. Here&amp;#39;s some thoughts as to how I might do things the next time that I work through the world of weekend time, how I can get some more effective communications rather than just more frequent.
Short asynchronous private message. A Twitter direct message works nicely for this, as does an SMS message.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Sisyphus had it easy.&amp;quot;
I&amp;#39;ll be off email starting Friday night and continuing to Sunday night; the second weekend in a row of a &amp;quot;no email&amp;quot; weekend. It wasn&amp;#39;t quite 100% offline the first weekend, since I&amp;#39;m so addicted, but I made a point of not clicking on any messages in my inbox and not sending any mail.
Part of the plan for not doing email is making sure that at the end of the time you can recover gracefully and not feel overwhelmed.</description>

      <description>From The Unknowledge Pattern Language, on Nooron:
 Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&amp;#39;t know about the elements, until we &amp;quot;filled in the blanks.&amp;quot; These &amp;quot;named voids&amp;quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery?</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR, May 7, 2015: Power outage maps for those utility companies that provide it are listed here by state, alphabetically. As of November 2, 2014, 45 of 50 states have something here.
The list is known to be incomplete, but the list from Wikipedia (outage management system) is also incomplete. To be overly comprehensive, if there are screen captures that I can gather, I will; they will not be current when you look at them, but I will time and date stamp them as best I can.</description>

      <description>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&amp;#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&amp;#0160;
The Twitter input box doesn&amp;#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&amp;#39;t pop for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve written about Supermemo before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&amp;#39;t overwhelm.</description>

I envy those with enough status to completely exit electronic mail, but at the very least I expect that an occasional weekend could be email-free.

      <description>The a2b3 group met at Eastern Accents this Thursday, June 2, 2011. Here&amp;#39;s a summary of sorts.
I took notes in a quadrille notebook   for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly.</description>

a2b3. I would have loved to have written meeting non-summaries for every lunch meeting, capturing at least who was there, what the question was, how long it took to introduce everyone, how many people where there, and who the new people were.</description>

      <description>This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens, and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.
Coconut-potato curry.
 2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved 1 onion, chopped Oil for frying curry powder, to taste 1 can coconut milk 2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed  Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done.</description>

      <title>Bo Biafra: &#34;the invisible paw of the International Wolverine Conspiracy has taken down Tressel&#34;</title>

      <description>The Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning that Jim Tressel has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&amp;#39;s leadership of the program, culminating in an NCAA investigation.
For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the Dead Schembechlers. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&amp;#39;s best to have a &amp;quot;holy rivalry&amp;quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &amp;quot;New Wolverine Order&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&amp;quot;, or the &amp;quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&amp;quot;.</description>

Twitter, to chat with people who are also in their basements. The local hash tag is #miwx for severe weather. I have a list @vielmetti/weather that I follow for the news.
Weather Underground for radar and forecasts and what not. I like the classic version of the user interface, which is busy and deep and which I know well enough to navigate.</description>

      <description>Gil Scott-Heron (b. April 1, 1949; d. May 27, 2011) was a poet and musician.
 Obituaries: NPR, by Daoud Tyler-Ameen; Wikipedia; Associated Press / New York Times.
Los Angeles Times written by Randall Roberts for the blog Pop and Hiss:  Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson. Written after Scott-Heron had recorded &#34;I&#39;m New Here&#34; but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.</description>

 Crowdmap&amp;#0160;is a tool that allows you to crowdsource information and visualize it on a map and timeline.
 I&amp;#39;ve typed in a bunch of these, but if you notice a news report of flooding, sewer spills, landslides, closed roads or fish flopping around on the road please add in a dot on the map with a link.</description>

      <description>Lightning hit a brick chimney at Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Northside Elementary School on Wednesday at about 4:15 p.m., sending bricks flying 100 feet through the school pickup area. Fortunately, no one was hurt, as the area was vacant except for a staff member&amp;#39;s vehicle which was damaged by flying brick.
I was aware of this when it happened because the lightning strike was powerful enough to cause the power grid to bounce, prompting comments on Twitter and speculating on the exact location.</description>

      <description>The river is high. Will it flood? That&amp;#39;s a very good question to ask in the morning before a storm; and the answer today turned out to be yes. Roads were inundated, Lake Barracuda emerged from its stormwater geyser, Depot Street filled with water, Mullholland Creek popped a manhole cover, and S. Main Street near Michigan Stadium filled. West Park&amp;#39;s new water features get a workout.
Basements have taken on water, and the full extent of storm damage is unknown yet until we get the May 26 predicted rains.</description>

      <description>The Michigan Open Meetings Act requires 18 hours advance notice of special meetings, and even less time (though I am not clear how much less time) for special meetings of committees. Thus, if you were not on a mailing list (with a relatively small number of people on the list), you did not receive notice directly of this meeting which is needed to resolve the City of Ann Arbor and the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority&amp;#39;s mutual disagreements over the city budget.</description>

      <description>Two years ago, the state of the art in local news aggregation was outside.in. That site aggregated postings about a specific geographical area and offered up a web based user interface to republish those links on your web site. Outside.in did not have its own staff of reporters, and its automated systems for newsgathering were (to be charitable) fallible, and thus it sometimes threw up junk of various kinds which was unpleasant to wade through.</description>

Note the track along Michigan Avenue and then heading a bit to the north via the Davison; you&amp;#39;re looking for when individual purple dots turn to green, yellow, orange and then red.

      <description>This weblog has more than 2000 posts in it, and from time to time I sift through it looking at old work looking to make it better.
I can see that my writing improves to the extent that I believe that other people will read it. The best written pieces are publishable, at least in the modern web sense of publishable. The ones that need improvement usually need a new lead paragraph, a bunch of formatting cleanup, and some kind of conclusion.</description>

&amp;#0160;
Identify the public body which has oversight or jurisdiction over the issue in question. There may be multiples of these, at the local, county, state and federal levels, plus occasionally a treaty organization or two that gets involved.</description>

The one constant is that everyone seems to have gotten a lot of rain. Here&amp;#39;s a map of the last 7 days of precipitation.

      <description>A convenient calendar for the end of the school year, which is to say that I&amp;rsquo;m doing this for next year.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a point when I visit the school to pick up or drop off J. to make a pass past the lost and found and put anything on a hanger that could possibly go onto a hanger. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know if that makes an immediate difference, but it&amp;rsquo;s satisfying to find a 5 minute volunteer opportunity that I can see.</description>

      <description>The building is at the corner of Huron and Fifth Avenue in Ann Arbor, across the street from the downtown fire department and also across the street from the striking brutalist wonder of the Michigan Bell telecom bunker.
With every downtown event comes the &amp;quot;where do we park&amp;quot; question, to which I am certain that there must be an answer.
Light refreshments will be served!

      <description>Today is opening day. Every year the baseball season is a little different, as the Internet is a little different. I&#39;ll probably be tuning in on Twitter (#tigers), and hopefully I&#39;ll have a terrestrial radio receiver handy. For more media, the Detroit Free Press live blog should have play-by-play updates.
My favorite bit of Tigers memorabilia to share is this letter from the Detroit Baseball Club, sent after the 1984 World Series from CEO Jim Campbell to University of Michigan Men&#39;s Glee Club faculty advisor Jim Shortt.</description>

      <description>A portion of a retaining wall on Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s downtown Library Lot project failed on March 24, 2011, causing a sinkhole to open up and forcing the evacuation of Earthen Jar and Jerusalem Garden, two restaraunts nearby.
At noon on Friday, March 25, Jerusalem Garden was open again for business. Earthen Jar is expected to open at 1:30 p.m., per to a phone call to the restaurant.
Will those restaurants be open for business on Friday, March 25?</description>

      <description>A portion of a retaining wall failed on March 24, 2011 before 5:00 p.m. at the Ann Arbor &amp;quot;Library Lot&amp;quot; construction project, and Earthen Jar and Jerusalem Garden have been evacuated as a result.
 Contractors from Christman, Soil and Materials Engineers, DTE Energy, and Doan Companies&amp;#0160;were on site at 9:00 p.m. to stabilize the sinkhole that formed when a portion of the retaining wall gave way.&amp;#0160;

Note that it doesn&amp;#39;t include every possible thing going on, just what people tell me about, and what is interesting enough for me to notice and plan ahead for. I&amp;#39;ll be at some of these, I hope.

      <title>Huron River water level watching: USGS National Water Information System</title>

      <description>Follow the level of the Huron River as it goes through Ann Arbor&amp;#0160;with the USGS National Water Information System. On March 23, the river is rising, but it&amp;#39;s also fluctuating in levels, enough that it&amp;#39;s difficult to determine whether current trends would lead you to believe that there is any risk of flooding.
If you were to watch this closely, what would you watch?
The USGS will give you an alert if the level of the river is above or below a certain level.</description>

      <description>March 22 is World Water Day. The 2011 theme is Water for Cities: Responding to the Urban Challenge. The Ann Arbor District Library is hosting a 7:00 p.m. panel &amp;quot;Our Water, Our Future&amp;quot;, with&amp;#0160;Mike Wiley from the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment hosting.
A recording of the event is available for viewing or download at the Ann Abor District Library.
In Ann Arbor, the slow-moving but inexorable urban water supply problem is the spread of a dioxane plume towards the Huron River and the City of Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s drinking water supply source at Barton Pond.</description>

(Dinah Sanders)   Each quarter I celebrate the modern holiday of&amp;#0160;Discardia.&amp;#0160;This quarter&amp;#39;s Discardia runs from&amp;#0160;March 20 (the vernal equinox) to April 3 (the new moon).&amp;#0160;Here&amp;#39;s some of the things I did with my kids this Discardia season.</description>

      <description>Publish quickly. The network rewards the first person to show up on the scene to describe what is going on, and it&amp;#39;s important to get a version of that story underway promptly.&amp;#0160;
Edit at leisure.&amp;#0160;The editing process takes time, and it shouldn&amp;#39;t be unduly rushed. If necessary, work at it one paragraph at a time, and publish each paragraph after it is finished. Every single piece of work can be improved at any time by an edit.</description>

Eggs were plentiful, $3/doz and up.&amp;#0160;Donna&amp;#0160;Puehler&amp;#0160;from Delta, Ohio who owns Grandma&amp;#39;s Kitchen said her chickens were enjoying the out of doors.
The most lovely ornamental I saw were the pussy willows from Jan Upston at Wasem Fruit Farm&amp;#0160;in Augusta Township. &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
Molly Notarianni, the market manager, talked to me about plans for a new Wednesday evening market, which will only feature prepared foods and fresh produce.</description>

Of the map, the authors write (in German)

      <description>I wrote a weekly FOIA Friday column for AnnArbor.com for about a year. The position that I had was eliminated in layoffs in March 2011, as the Ann Arbor Chronicle&#39;s story History Repeats at AnnArbor.com describes. Ironically, I was laid off the week before the newspaper industry promotes Sunshine Week, though I am certain that was just coincidence.

      <description>On this day, St. Urho drove the grasshoppers out of Finland and by doing so saved the Finnish grape crop. More from SaintUrho.com&amp;#0160;and from the 1800+ fans of the St Urho page on Facebook.
Heinäsirkka, heinäsirkka, mene täältä hiiteen!
Traditionally: wear purple, celebrate by drinking wine.
As it turns out, Urho didn&amp;#39;t complete his task, and a 2009 book&amp;#0160;Suomen heinäsirkat ja hepokatit (&amp;quot;The Grasshoppers and Crickets of Finland&amp;quot;) describes the species of orthoptera found in Finland.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s a view from Ann Arbor of the Japanese earthquake. A magnitude 8.9 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan at 5:46 UTC, 2:46 pm Japan time, and 12:46 a.m. Eastern Time, about 6200 miles from Ann Arbor. Damage is extensive, with the city of Sendai hit hard, and concern for the&amp;#0160;Fukushima Nuclear Plant. The effects of the tsunami stretched across the Pacific.

      <description>Camera-wiki.org is a successful, non-commercial fork of Camerapedia. It was built over the span of about a month, with a small team of volunteers reconstructing the wiki and its image database in response to a sale of Camerapedia to Wikia. Steevithiak tells the tale from the inside, of late-night perl scripts crawling through the databases reconstructing the site and of coordinated action to rebuild the photo pool.
The challenge of running a wiki is not only that you have to maintain a large collection of encyclopedic content, but also that you have to keep a pile of funky software running.</description>

      <description>The world of Twitter has an infinite demand for your 140 character episodes, but it&amp;#39;s not a satisfying place to compose something that has depth or nuance to it. My daily column of 500 words on AnnArbor.com takes an hour or more to write, and I never have the sense that I can dash it off casually.
Perhaps the best approach is to aim for a happy medium. What if the unit of composition is 140 words, not 140 characters?</description>

      <description>An old bicycle wheel makes a good pulley wheel.
An old modem, of any sort, can be repurposed by attaching a single RJ-11 cord to both ends of it; you now have a loop, and the RJ-11 threads through the bicycle wheel.
An RS-232 cable should be thought of as a very strong wire rope with helpful screw connectors.&amp;#0160;
A transformer makes an excellent counterweight.
There is no piece of old electronic junk that doesn&amp;#39;t have some possible usefulness as a part of a kinetic sculpture, whether it works or not.</description>

      <description>You are given a day to produce something of interest. How much of that time should be spend reading, and how much time should be spent writing?
There is a good argument to be made that you want to minimize your research budget and maximize the number of words produced. It&amp;#39;s hard to be a productive writer when the time is spent in the inbox deleting mail or on the net looking aimlessly for something of interest, for neither mode lends itself to long stretches of concentrated thought.</description>

 It really died a few years ago, but this at least makes it official. I really liked the service when it was under active development, especially because it tracked click-through on links quite effectively; I am sure there is some way to replicate that using Google Analytics, but I didn&amp;#39;t get far enough into the new event tracking parts of it to make it work.</description>

LA Times / Associated Press:&amp;#0160;Thousands rally at Wisconsin Capitol to protest anti-union bill. &amp;#0160;
 The new Republican governor, Scott Walker, is seeking passage of the nation&amp;#39;s most aggressive anti-union proposal - a plan that would all but eliminate the bargaining process for most public employees.

      <description>The Dayton Daily News notes an overnight frost quake centered around Darke County, Ohio&amp;#0160;on February 10, 2011.
 The quake, or cryoseism as it’s known in scientific circles, occurs when moisture soaks into the soil and a quick freeze causes a sudden, even violent expansion and contraction. Darke County’s 911 director Brandon Redmond said the quakes erupted for eight hours Thursday, starting at 1 a.m. The heaviest reports were between 5:30-7:30 a.</description>

From the Renesys blog, &amp;quot;Egypt leaves the Internet&amp;quot;
 At 22:34 UTC (00:34am local time), Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet&amp;#39;s global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt&amp;#39;s service providers. Virtually all of Egypt&amp;#39;s Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide.</description>

      <description>The video, entitled &#34;It is pitch dark&#34;, from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot.

The lyrics, in part:
You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue?
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, Flickr was just an experimental part of Game Neverending. Then it was a full blown society, full of interesting people who happened to express their interestingness through photography. Digital photography was new then, and special, and there was some first flush of enthusiasm for having a system that &amp;quot;got it&amp;quot;.
Time and space happened, and Flickr became part of Yahoo. A piece of the fun drained out, and the Internet got bigger.</description>

Street Railway Journal. v.21, 1903.
Electric Railway Service (Detroit United Lines). 1917. This last one is remarkable as an in-house PR newsletter, full of editorials railing against the Detroit Evening News, and with notably precise accounting for the delays (and causes thereof) on streetcar lines. &amp;quot;The Lying Evening News Still Continues to Lie&amp;quot; was a headline from 1914.</description>

      <description>For future reference, since I end up immediately thinking of Veblen when I read about artisanal tofu. This from Theory of the Leisure Class is on hand-made goods (emphasis added).
 The position here taken is enforced in a felicitous manner by the place assigned in the economy of consumption to machine products. The point of material difference between machine-made goods and the hand-wrought goods which serve the same purposes is, ordinarily, that the former serve their primary purpose more adequately.</description>

      <description>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup.
The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere.
The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food.</description>

      <description>The scuttlebutt is that delicious is going to be axed by Yahoo.&amp;#0160;
Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &amp;#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.
Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it.</description>

      <title>clean your dishwasher with the breakfast drink of astronauts</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s a cheaper way to clean a dishwasher than to put heavily marketed, sugary &amp;ldquo;breakfast drink&amp;rdquo; powder into it. Tang is citric acid and sweetener and artificial flavor that tastes like moon rocks.
The dishwasher is cleaner, though, which is a good thing.
Other suggestions for cleaners include vinegar, straight citric acid, borax, and baking soda. None of those have the astronaut cachet.</description>

      <description>An old, old recipe to keep your feet warm: sprinkle cayenne in your socks. &amp;#0160;
 The powdered capsicum slightly dusted in the socks of persons subject to cold feet will generally prove a salutary means of overpowering that unpleasant sensation. (The American Dispensatory, 1823)
 Not recommended to keep your fingers warm.
An illustrated example, from The Cooper Family: Warm feet in the snow.</description>

      <description>A much-beloved but seedy local landmark will close, with developers planning to build a shiny hi-rise on the location. The developers will raise enough money to partially demolish the landmark, but will run out of money before they start building the hi-rise. A decade and several bankruptcies later, a new building will be built on top of the rubble.</description>

      <description>My twitter feed is full of the Wikileaks release of 400,000 records from the Iraq War. A number of news organizations got early access to the data; each of them wrote their own story.
New York Times: The War Logs.
Al Jazeera: The Secret Iraq Files.
The Guardian: Iraq: The War Logs.
Spiegel Online: Iraq War Logs.
CNN was offered the data, but chose not to take it.
 CNN was offered access to the documents in advance of the release but declined because of conditions that were attached to accepting the material.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;When you retire,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;you should go offline for a whole year.&amp;quot;
The idea is to sell all of your computers, turn in your cell phone, and generally shun any computer technology. Perhaps you&amp;#39;ll still write, but it will be longhand or on a typewriter. If there&amp;#39;s a phone call to be made, you&amp;#39;ll have to be there to receive it, since there is no answering machine. No Twitter, no Facebook, no blogs.</description>

      <description>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece. (This article will be no exception.) But the academic buzz around the subject isn’t just a case of eggheads rationalizing their slothfulness. As various scholars argue in “The Thief of Time,” edited by Chrisoula Andreou and Mark D.</description>

      <description>Also known as &amp;quot;retcon&amp;quot;, this is a term from science fiction and from comics. &amp;#0160;As pulled from the notoriously unreliable Wikipedia entry for retcon (at least today):
 &amp;quot;Retroactive continuity&amp;quot; was shortened to &amp;quot;retcon&amp;quot;, reportedly by Damian Cugley in 1988 on&amp;#0160;USENET. Hard evidence of Cugley&amp;#39;s abbreviation has yet to surface, though in a USENET posting on August 18, 1990, Cugley posted a reply in which he identified himself as &amp;quot;The originator of the word &amp;#39;retcon&amp;#39;.</description>

 Third is&amp;#0160;discipline&amp;#0160;(here comes the Foucault!). Most readers will probably know where this line of argument goes – rankings and other metrics are internalized and begin to alter our behavior without any direct action on the part of the rankings-makers.

      <description>I must learn to love the fool in me—the one who feels too much, talks too much, takes too many chances, wins sometimes and loses often, lacks self-control, loves and hates, hurts and gets hurt, promises and breaks promises, laughs and cries. It alone protects me against that utterly self-controlled, masterful tyrant whom I also harbor and who would rob me of human aliveness, humility and dignity but for my fool.</description>

The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm
The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The reader became the book; and summer night
Was like the conscious being of the book. The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The words were spoken as if there was no book,
Except that the reader leaned above the page,
Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be</description>

      <description>How far in the future do you need to be thinking to make sense of the world?
I can imagine some calendar-centered routine that starts with &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll need that for tomorrow&amp;quot; and works its way out slowly through time into a year from now. &amp;#0160;To the extent that you can do something now in advance of needing to do something in the future (distinct from planning to do something in the future) that seems reasonable.</description>

      <description>The Michigan Radio account&amp;#0160;details the opposition:  But not everyone agrees. A representative of large scale chicken farms has warned the city of the risk of disease. And the Kent County Health Department also opposes backyard chickens.  The Editorial from the Grand Rapids Press is careful not to take a side on the question.
 Grand Rapids is considering joining the trend. The city’s proposal will be up for a public hearing July 13.</description>

      <description>The Bloom filter, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970,[1] is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.</description>

      <description>The basic idea of a non-imaging light concentrator is that if you just want bright light in a particular spot and don’t care about making the light form an optical image, you can just generally reflect random light into the desired place. The concentrated light then illuminates any subject in that spot from all sides, making a very bright yet diffuse light. This idea has already been used for concentrating sunlight for solar power applications, but as far as I can see nobody has applied it to photography.</description>

      <description>Rankings, an ordinal list, can result from tests or from contests. Start with contests, and take first the forms in which competitors play against each other. The score in such a contest indicates which player (team) performed better (earned more runs or goals, ran faster, jumped higher) against another or others on a given day. The score of a soccer match is the result of a direct, head to head competition.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#39;s a question I often pose at the beginning of projects, and one that I struggle with often when there is no simple answer.&amp;#0160; Some reflection has me thinking it might be too simple a question to pose when goals are complex and long term and emergent.
I&amp;#39;ll illustrate with a project that by some multiple measures has been successful so far, my weekly lunch meeting called a2b3.&amp;#0160; Every week we gather for lunch, people eat, they talk, they leave.</description>

      <description>Copied in its entirety from the Iowa, City IA city government web page in their &#34;Public Art&#34; section.
King-Littrell-Palmer Chicken Hatchery
Irving King, head of the University of Iowa Department of Literature, had an unusual sideline for an English professor: raising chickens. In 1918, King started a hatchery as a hobby on the south side of Jackson Avenue. Eventually, the hatchery occupied several wood structures from Sheridan Avenue to Ralston Creek between the alley and Rundell Street.</description>

      <description>Aardvark is vark.com - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &amp;quot;your network&amp;quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&amp;#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &amp;#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&amp;#39;s capable of doing.</description>

      <description>The challenge is to get rid of some set of books that have accumulated, while simultaneously fulfilling the need to always have some kind of new reading in the house. &amp;#0160;
A new (to me) way to do this is Paperback Swap, a system which works as a trading board for books. &amp;#0160;You are entitled to books in the proportion that you send books to others, and every book you request is free to you.</description>

      <description>James Poulos in a comment on Ricochet on the role of editors:
Writers now have competing pressures -- to be witty, quick, ironic, noticeable, flip, to dispatch every clay pigeon tossed up by a culture pandemic with pigeons; but also to self-edit, to self-moderate, to be reticent at the right time, to pussyfoot expertly, to pick battles, to avoid perils, to besmirch rarely, to duck blame, to satisfy spectral overseers. This is a serious pickle, is it not?</description>

      <description>An essay published in Open Letters Monthly.
What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. I fear for our memory theaters.</description>

When you say “color coding improved your ears”, the first thing that comes to mind is that you are doing some kind of machine-assisted synesthesia. very cool, that. another enticing pice from oblong industries
It&amp;#39;s true that one of the elements is a blue ball that bounces in time to the music and touches down on the notes that are playing just then.</description>

      <description>Hiding in municipal archives across the county are maps of where the freeways will go. &amp;nbsp;Some of them got built, some of them didn&#39;t. &amp;nbsp;Those documents will date from after the Second World War, and lots of them will be 1950s and 1960s artifacts.
Some of the history will show up in land records; this account from Genoa Township looks typical
 The land was farmed from 1950 until 1962 when the Michigan State Highway came through and condemned eight different parcels in the township to construct Interstate 96.</description>

M. and I went to the spillway that connects this mill race with the Huron, just upstream of the Detroit Edison Argo Substation. &amp;#0160;There was a lot of trash - sticks, logs, aquatic weeds of various kinds, the odd can and bottle - clogging the spillway.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m reading Timothy Egan&#39;s The Big Burn. Here&#39;s other information online about that disasterous fire.
The Great 1910 Fire of Idaho, Montana, and Washington site - 1910fire.com - is run by Wade Bilbrey of Avery, Idaho.
The Idaho Forest Products Commission has Idaho Forest Fire Stories: The 1910 Fire, written by Jim Petersen and originally printed in Evergreen Magazine, Winter Edition 1994-1995.</description>

      <description>About this analysis, from the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service of the National Weather Service
:  &amp;ldquo;Observed&amp;rdquo; data is a byproduct of National Weather Service (NWS) operations at the 12 CONUS River Forecast Centers (RFCs), and is displayed as a gridded field with a spatial resolution of roughly 4x4 km. &amp;ldquo;Observed&amp;rdquo; data is expressed as a 24-hour total ending at 1200 Z (same as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT), with longer periods simply being a summation of multiple 24-hour periods.</description>

      <description>That&amp;#39;s not news.
Is this news worthy... really? &amp;#0160;
Who cares?
How can writing so void of analysis and content, based on innuendo and false assumptions be so widely admired?
Slow news day.
Follow the money.

There&amp;#39;s a law which I haven&amp;#39;t formed completely which notes that those who complain the most about the comments have the least to say. &amp;#0160;On the other hand, when some does a rewrite to your intern&amp;#39;s story, you know that they are reading you quite carefully.</description>

      <description>February is thirteen months long in Michigan. - A Primer, Bob Hicok, The New Yorker
Looking forward to February, a civic project: a Marcel Duchamp readymade project, a retrospective civic installation of his work Prelude to a Broken Arm (1915). See Shearer, 1997 for more.
The installation would provide a convenient hook for each of these readymade pieces. Care must be taken to ensure that the works of art be completely decorative and not functional.</description>

      <description>post-storm mushroom 5/5, originally uploaded by Edward Vielmetti. Big storms came through town and dumped somewhere between 2 and 4 inches of rain in the neighborhood. A morning walk showed a lot of mushrooms that came out including these unknown varieties growing on a dead (or partly dead) tree.

      <description>for reference:
The A2B3 logo design is by Laura Fisher of Mitten Artworks.
The font is P22&amp;#39;s London Underground. &amp;#0160;Accept no substitutes.
The stickers I printed were printed at VG Kids&amp;#0160;in Ypsilanti. &amp;#0160;We used a&amp;#0160;2.75&amp;quot; x 4.25&amp;quot; oval, and one of their standard templates.
The hoodie with the top secret illuminati lining is still under construction.
Update 6/13/10: Typekit has the P22 London Underground font, for $25/yr. &amp;#0160;Hmm.</description>

      <description>More at VacuumLand&amp;nbsp;and a review at the Austin Statesman.
The convention isn&#39;t open to the public, but if you were to drop in, you&#39;d find these people attending clinics on repairing, cleaning and restoring vacuums. You&#39;d see them holding vacuuming contests, playing &#34;Vacuum Jeopardy&#34; and eating vacuum-shaped cake on tables decorated with vacuum components. Each was allowed to bring along 12 vacuums.  Next time I&#39;ll ask for a press pass.</description>

Next, GM killed Saturn.
Then, Ford killed Mercury.
Now, Jupiter is under attack.
When will the madness end?

      <description>I had a disturbing thought while rereading Malcolm Gladwell&amp;#39;s piece on Nassim Taleb in his latest book which collects his New Yorker essays. What if Taleb is not only profiting from unknownable random adverse events, but also encouraging their proliferation?
The logic runs like this. You place a series of bets, where if you lose you lose $1 and if you win you win $1000000. The bets are on some implausible condition, one which (at the outset) there is no chance of happening.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write something short and pithy and insightful for Facebook or Twitter or some other minimalist thing and couldn&amp;#39;t come up with anything. &amp;#0160;The ultrashort format is not suited to ruminations on things you don&amp;#39;t completely understand and are trying to work out in the process of writing about them.
Instead I will go for a walk.
Perhaps this is a rumination on the length of communications, their immediacy and the expected audience.</description>

      <description>I used this phrase in my meaningless indicators of progress post.
Some other uses of it, just so I manage to put it in an appropriate context:
Chronicle of Higher Education has a story called The Art of Living Mindfully on the work of Ellen Langer. Her blog is not frequent but it is thoughtful.
 We have been explicitly and implicitly taught by our culture to be mindless. We have been taught absolutes when none really exist independent of context.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out how to retell stories about a place that I only know a little about. &amp;#0160;The particular spot is a one time grocery store, now a bicycle shop, that I am guessing was a center of a neighborhood in its time. If there ever was a lore around it, it circulates among a group of people who I don&amp;#39;t know. &amp;#0160;The owner of the store was notable in his day, but that day is about 60 years ago.</description>

      <description>Metblogs was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.
From Metblogs series finale:
[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May.</description>

      <description>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &amp;#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.
I had to hit &amp;quot;shift-refresh&amp;quot; to force everything to load.

      <description>I have been in too many meetings where the first part of the meeting is the brainstorm of what we might do to address the opportunity at hand, and the remainder of the meeting is the long, tedious process of turning that vision into a project plan with dates and deliverables and milestones and activities that can be resolved into auditable checkboxes on a spreadsheet. And you know what? I hate the work that turns vision into process before the vision has had a chance to see how things actually are for a while.</description>

      <description>is still worth fighting over, if you and your brother both want it.
What&#39;s the smallest piece of lego?
A eurobricks forum suggests it is a flower petal.
Lugnut says a gold coin, weighing in at just over 0.056 g; the flower petal is a hefty 0.064 g.
For reference, a 1x1 plate is 0.176 g and a 1x8 brick is 3.06 g.

Drive the car to an auto parts store (O&amp;#39;Reilly, formerly Murray&amp;#39;s), borrow their diagnostic tool, read out the code. &amp;#0160;The tool itself doesn&amp;#39;t say too much about what it is, but it was free to use, and it was easy to use. &amp;#0160;Note to self: next time the check engine light goes on on any vehicle, take it there first.</description>

      <description>The season of discardia is upon us again. &amp;#0160;
It&amp;#39;s time to unsubscribe from mailing lists, take out the trash, empty out your pockets, weigh your inbox and reduce its weight, clean out the cupboards and more.
It&amp;#39;s also time for me to stop even pretending that I can follow everything that have at one time been interested in and let some things that fascinate me slip by the wayside for a while, so that in some future I can come back to them and be surprised by how much progress has been made since I was gone.</description>

I take no small measure of pride in the first comment: &amp;quot;thank god for the ann arbor news and their hard-hitting muskrat coverage. unbelievable.&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.
In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&amp;#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.
Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&amp;#39;s missing the lack is noted.</description>

The working structure for the talk is the 5 minute or so talk I give at the beginning of every a2b3 meeting, with the little ritual introduction of the group and the origin story and the monologue. I think it will work out; heaven knows that I&#39;ve had some practice.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m still trying to modulate which parts of which other feeds and streams land in Buzz, the new service from Google which is similar to but different from Twitter.
I took out the automated post from Twitter to Buzz, for now, since I looked at my habits on Twitter and how it looked on Buzz and it looked ugly. I like my Twitter, which is mostly centered around Ann Arbor related newsy things, and that looks silly on Buzz.</description>

      <description>Edna St. Vincent Millay: This Gifted Age

Upon this age, that never speaks its mind,
This furtive age, this age endowed with power
To wake the moon with footsteps, fit an oar
Into the rowlocks of the wind, and find
What swims before his prow, what swirls behind &amp;mdash;
Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,
Rains from the sky a meteoric shower
Of facts &amp;hellip; they lie unquestioned, uncombined.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve changed the title of this blog back to Vacuum, since all of the extra gobbledygook was making it hard to bookmark things.
The &#34;quick compose&#34; part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don&#39;t have titles, so I don&#39;t get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type. Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like.</description>

 Even more interesting are the stories about Walmart’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and the real reason why David Lee Roth used to demand that there be a bowl of M&amp;amp;M’s with all the brown ones removed in his dressing room backstage. Times Online review
The surgeon-author was on the track of what might be described as a classic magic bullet — a low-tech way in a high-tech, expensive world in which lives might be saved and costs reduced.</description>

      <description>Michael Sippey writes about Ben Hammersley writing about metadata.The quote he pulls is
So why do everything you can to keep metadata intact? Because it’s from this information that new products can be automatically created, at a scale and rapidity that would be impossible otherwise. With every piece of metadata that you don’t throw away, you gain a factor more potential ways of slicing through your content and delivering it as a separate product, simply as a result of a database lookup.</description>

      <description>Networked buffering: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, James Whitacre and Axel Bender, 2009/12/10, arXiv:0912.1961
Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents.</description>

The back story is that some veterans of the &amp;quot;strike newspaper&amp;quot; industry decided they could make a go of doing a new daily Detroit paper, with delivery.
They launched to the point of being able to print a week&amp;#39;s worth of paper, then abruptly shut down.</description>

The OMA resolution, which was added to council’s agenda at 5 p.m. on Oct. 20, was discussed in relation to the approval of the Ypsilanti Downtown Development Authority bylaws - a separate agenda item at the meeting.</description>

      <description>(write about the display in Paradise)
from the Sault Star:
The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum is getting to once again ring the bell 29 times, during the 14th annual Edmund Fizgerald Memorial Service. The Edmund Fitzgerald, a 729-foot ore carrier, and her entire crew of 29 men were lost on Lake Superior 34 years ago in one of the worst storms in three decades. The freighter lies north-northwest of Whitefish Point in 160 metres of water.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been writing a &amp;quot;FOIA Friday&amp;quot; series at AnnArbor.com, and the thought has started to occur to me that it would be a lot easier to write it if I had another blog to use to cut and paste clippings into so that I had more material to work from.
So, prepare for a new FOIA blog at http://vielmetti.typepad.com/foia which doesn&amp;#39;t have a clever name yet but will serve as a place to collect stuff that&amp;#39;s relevant and interesting to open government issues, yet out of scope for the newspaper.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#39;s a wide variety of quality in people&amp;#39;s ability to express themselves in written form, and an &amp;quot;email interview&amp;quot; is one way of assessing this.&amp;#0160; This generally takes the form of a set of questions provided to the interviewee to be answered by them using whatever means they have to prepare a suitable answer.&amp;#0160; You will often find that it takes some time to get a response back, especially if there are a lot of questions or if the questions are hard.</description>

      <description>The basic idea is from Martha Rose &amp;quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&amp;quot; 1986, p. 103.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s very simple, as befits her normal cooking.&amp;#0160; Cut the tops from peppers, clean them out, fill with a mix of leftover rice and beans and top with cheese.&amp;#0160; Bake 30 to 40 minutes, as long as it takes for things to get as soft as you want.
I&amp;#39;m guessing I&amp;#39;ll end up using black beans; there&amp;#39;s rice from yesterday.</description>

 Blanch cauliflower and saute in olive oil until browned. Make a lemon-tahini-garlic sauce. Mix.&amp;#0160; Cook. &amp;#0160; Serve sprinkled with sumac and parsley.  Some alternatives:

      <description>From Concentrate: &amp;quot;The politics of dirt in downtown Ann Arbor&amp;quot;
The hole is for the Library Lot underground parking deck next to the Ann Arbor District Library. The city has started on some of the work to build a 677-car parking garage underneath a surface parking lot on Fourth Street and to replace some of the surrounding infrastructure, such as sewer and water lines. 
But the big hole for all of those cars is coming later this year.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s the annual letter for Saturday Morning Physics at Michigan, published in its entirety because I am lazy.
----
Greetings Saturday Morning Physics Community Members,
&amp;#0160;
September marks the start of a new academic year, the return of Michigan Football, and the beginning of a new and exciting year of Saturday Morning Physics (SMP)! We are proud to be starting our 14th year of SMP on October 3rd and are very grateful to our speakers and our audience for their time and enthusiasm, which has made SMP so successful.</description>

      <description>Add you to my address book, and note carefully your telephone number and postal address.
Give you a call; thank you for your mail; ask some questions that came up as a result of the mail that were too complicated to answer in a followup email.
Send you a handwritten note as a follow up to the telephone call.
Locate you on culturally appropriate online social networks (not all of them, but which ever were sensible) and do the appropriate friending rituals; note any mutual friends.</description>

      <description>After every Michigan football win, the band plays Temptation.&amp;nbsp; Here&amp;rsquo;s a version from practice.

And, after every Michigan win, the blog MGoBlog posts the Muppet Glee Club&amp;rsquo;s version of Temptation.. Alas, MGoBlog usually gives you the abbreviated version minus the first half of the sketch.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the whole thing. &amp;ldquo;It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what song you&amp;rsquo;re going to sing, as long as we all agree the song we&amp;rsquo;re going to sing.</description>

      <description>What just happened: I rode into town on the #5, including the portion of it which is under construction on Packard near campus. &amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;
The back story: City streets are always under construction in the summer time. &amp;#0160;Some times construction projects unexpectedly run late. &amp;#0160;When students move in, every single street near campus - including that stretch of campus near Packard - is jammed full of returning students. &amp;#0160;The students are coming (EEEK).</description>

      <description>We had purple beans for dinner, from farmer&amp;#39;s market.&amp;#0160; I heated some olive oil in a pan and cooked them through until they had turned all green, and then salted them a little at the end.
The recipe called for adding chopped almonds but it didn&amp;#39;t happen; instead I served the boys tofu that I had cut into cubes and boiled (boiling it improves the texture quite a bit, firming it up more to my liking).</description>

      <description>notes on the AnnArbor.com launch; first Sunday edition on the streets.
We were at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market a week ago, and market manager Molly Notarianni had a sample left of an item that a vendor was gearing up to sell for next year: a tub with a praying mantis ootheca which, when left inside, would hatch little bitty mantids for your garden. Well, today was the day that they hatched - this video is someone else&amp;rsquo;s kids enjoying their mantid hatch.</description>

      <description>Some notes, before I quit for the night, from the launch of AnnArbor.com .
We went live at 8pm Thursday.&amp;#0160; I took a nap after coming home from work, got up at about 830pm, and went online looking at the comments; most of that evening was spent answering comments, dealing with details, being helpful and present and attentive.&amp;#0160; As much as possible, I tried to be like Caterina and George were like at the launch of Flickr.</description>

      <description>The Jolly Pumpkin has a sign up at 311 S Main St, where Pepperz used to be, in downtown Ann Arbor. Barbara Tozier snapped a photo of the sign, a photo which has been making its rounds of the beer-loving community around town. Permits were approved for the space on July 21, 2009 for electrical work; ELEC09-0838 goes to contractor Top Line Electric LLC. Mechanical work on MECH09-1259 goes to Koch &amp; White Heating &amp; Cooling.</description>

      <description>The Fort Wayne Railroad Historical Society brought Nickel Plate 765, a steam engine, through Ann Arbor on its way to Owosso for Trainfestival 2009.  Of the engine they write:  This is the historic steam locomotive no. 765: a high-stepping, fourteen wheeled magnificent machine that stands 15 feet tall, weighs 404 tons, and goes over 60 miles an hour; restored to the way it looked and sounded when it was built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1944.</description>

      <description>Notes from day 16 of the new job at AnnArbor.com
Here is the &amp;quot;soft launch&amp;quot; definition from Wikipedia; of course you don&amp;#39;t completely trust Wikipedia, but it&amp;#39;s a first start, especially when you credit it.
Soft launching&amp;#0160;is the method of launching a missile (such as an&amp;#0160;anti-tank guided missile) in such a way that the&amp;#0160;rocket motor&amp;#0160;ignites outside of the launch tube; the missile is ejected non-explosively. The point is to minimize the risk of damage to the launcher by maintaining a safe distance.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been collecting data on parking prices for Michigan football games in yards near the stadium for a couple of years now; the better the team is doing, the better the chance that the $20 parking turns into $25 parking, or $15 turns into $20.&amp;#0160; The one data point I have for Art Fair parking pricing for 2009 is that a lot near the new office is offering $15 parking, in a location that in previous years had fetched $20.</description>

      <description>notes from day 14 at annarbor.com
Why was the launch scrubbed this time?

Hydrogen leaks (STS-127) (STS-73)Thunderstorms (STS-93)Problem circuit card in the pyrotechnic initiator controller (STS-51)
Perseid meteor shower&amp;#0160;(STS-51)
I didn&amp;#39;t see a complete list of all possible reasons, but there are lots of problems that can happen when you launch into space. &amp;#0160;I watched two launches in the last few days - the SpaceX rocket which went up without a hitch, and the shuttle which went up on its 6th try, all very exciting to see.</description>

      <description>Another copy of the Ann Arbor Gerbil showed up on my sidewalk this morning. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s nice to have a morning paper, much nicer than the mid-afternoon Ann Arbor Snooze that used to never arrive quite early enough to read over lunch, and by the time it got to be after dinner to read it it was most of a day old.

Some of last week&amp;#39;s Gerbils that were left on lawns unread decayed enough to leave crumbs of newspaper on the lawns of apartment buildings on Packard, no worse so far than the occasional decaying NY Times or Wall St Journals that sometimes pile up in front of student rentals unread.</description>

 Eastern Accents takes a vacation in the summer time so I was on my own to organize something somewhere else; and all of Ann Arbor is full of Art Fair food vendors, serving a wide range of cuisine ranging from elephant ears and funnel cakes to key lime limeade and coffee. &amp;#0160;(Water, $1 almost everywhere.</description>

      <description>public notes from day 13 at AnnArbor.com.
I&amp;#39;m noting some MT setup details here, since I need a spot for it, and since I&amp;#39;ve been relatively spoiled by having the Typepad crew figure out how to make things just work.
1. &amp;#0160;&amp;quot;Replace Word Characters&amp;quot;. &amp;#0160;A default setting when you paste in Word documents is to have them paste in with entity characters; this setting converts those to ASCII. &amp;#0160;(Word, bleah, but it&amp;#39;s the norm.</description>

The notable new item at farmer&amp;#39;s market today was peaches. &amp;#0160;Two vendors, Erie Orchards and Kapnick Orchards, both had peaches for sale - Kapnick had the Flaming Fury variety, and Erie had Garnet Beauty. &amp;#0160; Here&amp;#39;s what the net has to say about both of these:</description>

This declaration was extremely significant as Loux&amp;#039;s JS-Kit is currently installed on over 600,000 sites. He blames the death on social media sites like Twitter and Flickr and the rise of &amp;quot;parallel channels away from [the] product&amp;quot;. In essence, dialogue has moved from a singular destination to a series of parallel but separate social networking channels.</description>

A new newspaper showed up on my sidewalk yesterday afternoon; I&amp;#39;m not going to name it by name, but let&amp;#39;s just call it the A2 Gerbil.&amp;#0160; It was a happy little paper, full of happy little stories about quaint things happening in some leafy town somewhere near here.&amp;#0160; It took me a couple of minutes to leaf through it and a few more minutes to hunt down the web site for it and appreciate some of its finer points.</description>

      <description>day 8 of notes on my new job at annarbor.com
Almost every week for the last 4 years I&amp;#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&amp;#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&amp;#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers.</description>

      <description>Blogs-on-Paper Idea Runs Out of Steam - Bits Blog - NYTimes.com Not hilarious. It makes sense. Over 90% of Politico’s revenue comes from its print edition, even though it’s only distributed in D.C. The truth is, as the CFOs of both the NYTimes and WSJ will tell you, print advertising, on a CPM basis, generates 75x more revenue than Web ads. — Patricia (tags: blog newspaper print politico revenue-model)  John Palfrey » Citizen Editors In the past several weeks, I’ve been playing with a new format that my friends at TopTenSources developed.</description>

      <description>day six of notes about my new position at annarbor.com
It&amp;#39;s about a mile and a half as the crow flies from my office at annarbor.com to my home.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; If I&amp;#39;m willing to detour a bit out of the way along the way, I can make a reasonable direct path by bus, bicycle, or walking that takes me through a big part of central campus, the athletic campus, a few neighborhoods, about 20 coffee and ice cream shops, and dozens of bulletin boards where events and notices are posted.</description>

      <description>Trying to keep the chronology going - this is back to Monday of this week.
I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at AnnArbor.com .&amp;#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be.</description>

      <description>From Skepticism to Citizen Journalism via a Tea Party « Emerging Technologies Librarian I learned to mistrust the US popular press several years ago. A friend of mine is positioned high enough in the military to have a sense of the big picture and low enough to have a sense of what is going on in the lives of the “grunts”. It is an interesting point of view, and I have found little tidbits that cropped up in conversation to sometimes be wildly different from what was reported by our media.</description>

      <description>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process.
Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&amp;#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.
In some sense that&amp;#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &amp;quot;law of two feet&amp;quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people.</description>

I ducked out at the end of the second day of MT training and headed off to the DDA meeting downtown.&amp;#0160; The meeting had started on time, but I didn&amp;#39;t get there on time, so I missed some of the initial public commentary.
In addition to the usual crowd of developers, city staff, and other interested parties, there were three reporters in attendance: Dave Askins from the Ann Arbor Chronicle; Andrew Cluley, a news reporter at 89.</description>

      <description>Bob Frankston - Opportunity for Innovation Perhaps the most difficult concept is the need to invert our usual “procurement” model of problem solving – we can’t dictate the solutions but instead need to create (generative) opportunity and then accept the solutions that arise.
We can only dictate solutions for the short term but we’re rewarded for short term thinking. This makes it doubly difficult to “sell” the idea that we need to create opportunity.</description>

      <description>Aggregate, Curate, Publish To Create Local Media The good news is I wouldn&amp;#039;t have to build that aggregation and curation system. Our portfolio company Outside.in has built it and they launched it earlier this week. It&amp;#039;s called Outside.in For Publishers (OIP).

MinnPost charges, on average, $15 per thousand impressions for its display advertising, but because the ads are for local businesses, they’re only served to readers in Minnesota.

One of the things I&amp;#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&amp;#39;t exist yet.&amp;#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&amp;#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&amp;#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen.</description>

      <description>At various times I&amp;#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&amp;#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity.
It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.</description>

At DeGroot&amp;#39;s Strawberries in Gregory, 16 acres of lush plants are close to ripening.
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not too hot and could be a little warmer,&amp;quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &amp;quot;But the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket for the plants.</description>

      <description>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.
The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&amp;#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&amp;#39;t agree with.

      <description>this in from Crain&amp;#39;s Detroit:
Grady Burnett, who led Google Inc.’s advertising operation in Ann Arbor, has taken a position with Palo Alto, Calif.-based social media giant Facebook.com as it launches a revenue growth push.
Burnett now runs Facebook’s global online and inside sales.
Ann Arbor is the headquarters of Mountain View, Calif.-based Google’s AdWords division, the pay-per-click, search term-based advertising that’s the company’s primary source of revenue.
I would think this would be worthy of mention on TechMeme but no other stories up yet.</description>

      <description>telegraphic codes and message practice Buell&amp;#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a novel reuse of an old copper mine - the Miner&amp;rsquo;s Revenge bicycle race is using a 1&amp;frasl;3 mile long section of the mine no longer in active use as a part of the race course.&amp;nbsp; Bring your own lights - it&amp;rsquo;s dark in there.
 The race is July 11-12, 2009, with free on-site camping for racers and a bonfire the night before. Greenland is near Ontonagon; the mine is owned by the Adventure Mining Company which also does walking tours as well as other more extreme mining adventures that involve rappelling down a mine shaft.</description>

      <description>This seems to be a plausible strategy - people send you interesting things that you want to remember, so you post them to your blog so that when you search for them you find them.
If the blog seems overful of cut and paste of events sometimes, it&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m necessarily going to be going to all of them - who can do that with two kids at home! - but that it seemed like the best way to deal with an influx of details.</description>

      <description>We haven&amp;#39;t scheduled our visit yet to Rowe&amp;#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, MI, but as a public service you should know that they are open.&amp;#0160; From the mailing they sent out:
STRAWBERRY SEASON TO BEGIN SOON !!!!!! 
The first day of the 2009 strawberry season will be Wednesday June 3rd. As usual, when we first open not all of our varieties of berries are&amp;#0160; ready to pick. If you are looking to pick massive amounts to freeze or make jam it would be better to wait until they are more plentiful.</description>

      <description>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09). That gave me a chance to enter &amp;ldquo;airplane mode&amp;rdquo;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.</description>

Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&amp;#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.</description>

Twitter search: black river falls
As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there&#39;s a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.
When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.</description>

      <description>If you can figure out the City of Ann Arbor zoning, you&amp;#39;re better than me.
The Westside Farmers Market, which has been holding court in the parking lot of Zingerman&amp;#39;s Roadhouse, has put off its 2009 season until zoning issues get resolved.&amp;#0160; Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Westside Farmers&amp;#39; Market is currently &amp;quot;on hold&amp;quot; due to zoning restrictions from the city of Ann Arbor.

      <description>The &amp;quot;crisis informatics&amp;quot; (Google search) term is new to me, but the research I&amp;#39;ve been able to find under that term is familiar.&amp;#0160; Faced with an unexpected crisis situation that is bigger than what the mainstream media and existing government organizations can easily manage the news flow from, how do communities response in emergency situations with social media and with ad hoc emergency response systems?
Without going into lots of detail I do want to share one recent paper that caught my eye, via Leysia Palen: Backchannels on the Front Lines: Emergent Uses of Social Media in the 2007 Southern California Wildfires.</description>

      <description>On May 18, 1927, disgruntled school board member Andrew Kehoe bombed the Bath, Michigan school, killing 38 children and six adults.
There is a new book out on the disaster, entitled Bath Massacre: America&#39;s First School Bombing, from the University of Michigan Press, written by Arnie Bernstein.&amp;nbsp; The press kindly sent me a copy.&amp;nbsp; Bernstein has a historian&#39;s eye for small and significant period details of fascinating interest to anyone who thinks about what the 1920s were like in Michigan, which makes it easy to pick up anywhere and read some small detail that gives you a sense for the times.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow.
1.&amp;#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy.
2.&amp;#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to write.&amp;#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary.</description>

      <description>Bumboats are small boats used as floating shops that market to sailors in harbor.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;rsquo;s a tradition of them on the Great Lakes; here&amp;rsquo;s what I could find with a bit of searching.
In Duluth, Minnesota, the Marine Trader went back to the lakes in 1998:&amp;nbsp; (via a story in Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s World Port w/photos)
On May 24, 1998, an old boat and an even older maritime practice both came back to life.</description>

      <description>I put up a little project on github last night, twitter mutual friends.&amp;#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.
I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &amp;quot;follow or don&amp;#39;t follow&amp;quot; decision when someone follows you.&amp;#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</description>

      <description>When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&amp;#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.
As a small public service, the best one blog I&amp;#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again.</description>

      <description>Let me explain to you why those terms don&amp;#39;t explain things very well.
I learned about public accounting from studying the works of Henry Carter Adams at the Interstate Commerce Commission by going through his correspondence and notebooks as stored at the Bentley Library.&amp;#0160; Adams was an economist who left Ann Arbor to go to DC to help regulate the railroads, and in particular to help deduce by careful study of required safety records which of several kinds of rail technology in use were most prone to accidents that would injure, cripple, or kill railroad workers and passengers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve become one of those people who requests and then reads the &amp;quot;board packets&amp;quot; for meetings of public bodies.&amp;#0160; These are fascinating things, generally 50-150 page tomes of memos, spreadsheets, graphs, charts, and news clippings that the staff of a public body will prepare for its board to go into a public meeting.
The fascinating thing from a technical point of view is just how many of these board packets include spreadsheets, and how many of the spreadsheets are presented either as bitmapped images or as text-only documents.</description>

      <description>A trailer:
 Mark Starr&amp;#39;s review on GlobalPost of the new movie Sugar:
A fine start, though, is the new movie “Sugar” — a bittersweet look at the familiar baseball dream through Dominican eyes. The Dominican Republic has, in recent years, been Major League baseball’s mother lode. And to the young Dominicans, of course, America is the mother lode. Boys on the island dream of getting out and — just like Pedro Martinez or Albert Pujols or “Big Papi” David Ortiz — making it to the bigs and to its cathedral, Yankee Stadium.</description>

Candied violets are said to be very easy - dip the violet flower in egg white and then in sugar.

      <description>Laundry is a chore. I&amp;#39;m only slowly getting better at it after most of a year of having increasing responsibilities. Mama mama make me clean. Every day the same routine.&amp;#0160; (Jean Marzollo)

The most important part of doing laundry once you start it is to figure out what the cycle time is that you need to keep up to make continuous progress, and then work with that timing in mind as you plan your effort.</description>

      <description>The menu plan for tonight for the late supper for the resident scholar: spring salad w/asparagus, oyster mushrooms from Alpena, eggs from Grandma&amp;#39;s Kitchen, spinach from Brines Farm, savory tofu from the coop, and a curry dressing. The boys will probably get something a lot simpler.
I wish I had rhubarb to have made stewed rhubarb but I got there to market too late.&amp;#0160; A stewed rhubarb is a compote, which is not to say a compost.</description>

The Ann Arbor Area Chamber of Commerce now plans to use its own funds to reimburse people who purchased Ann Arbor Gold certificates. Earlier this year, the company that administers the program, CertifiChecks, filed for bankruptcy.

An April 15 story from the AP notes that the bankruptcy filing has gone through in Dayton, OH (via the Newark Advocate):</description>

Here&#39;s a list of some morel festivals in the state; if I have missed any, please let me know so that next year&#39;s list can be better.</description>

 The paragraph is the unit of composition.&amp;#0160; Keep your paragraphs together, making it possible to have any one of them pulled out and quoted in some other part of the internet without losing too much in the process.</description>

If I wanted to grow pea greens on my own, what variety of peas would I use?
Are pea vines usually sprayed, and would you want to look out for no-spray vendors?</description>

On CRM usage on &amp;quot;snow days&amp;quot; from John Paterson:
There has been a lot of press articles related to computing-in-the-bad-weather, talking about rolling out VPNs to peoples’ homes, how to protect the in-house network from home-borne viruses, but web based CRM needs nothing so complex - just log in and go! Sometimes life doesn’t need to be so complex.</description>

Horseradish is now available at market; $4 for a jar from Grandma&amp;#39;s Kitchen.&amp;#0160; Grandma says hers is pure, not mixed with turnip as some would do.&amp;#0160; Farmers Market had a lot of produce - field greens and flowers were the big new crops.&amp;#0160; We had some tat soi from Shannon Brines that was very good in a stir fry.
The phone on the farm in Homer, MI is answered only at 8am, if I read the handout right.</description>

      <description>Discardia is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.
Priority one is a book purge; I&amp;#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house.</description>

 THE STORY OF MAD-STONE
[Fort Worth (Texas), December 4th - Cor. New York Mail and Express]
Miss May Bartlett was bitten yesterday by a dog which, from all
indications, is mad. A mad-stone owned by W. R. Sanner, of this city,
has been applied and adhered several times, drawing out the poison.</description>

Here&amp;#39;s build notes for that, with the caveat that I am not 100% satisfied with it just yet, and it will probably get another tweak for the next preso.</description>

The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags. As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event:
There&amp;#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member Stephen Rapundalo, who&amp;#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said.</description>

The Ohio Attorney General, Richard Cordray, has sued Ann Arbor Gold vendor Certifichecks in Dayton, OH for violation of Ohio’s Consumer Sales Practices Act in conjunction with them shutting down redemptions of gift certificates from the Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce and 100s of other Chambers and civic organizations around the country.</description>

      <description>noted on Geert&amp;#39;s blog
IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network!
Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friends’ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)!</description>

      <description>I stumbled into a world of &amp;ldquo;parking advocacy organizations&amp;rdquo; (trade associations for parking structure operators) and this video about how a garage in California is using per-space lights and sensors to speed up the process of people finding parking in a structure that&amp;rsquo;s mostly full.
The parking rhetoric in Ann Arbor is that a structure is full if it&amp;rsquo;s at 85% capacity, based on one consultant&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;d like to challenge that and say that no one really cares how full a garage is if you know that you won&amp;rsquo;t be frustrated finding a space.</description>

      <description>Paul Harvey passed away today at the age of 90.
Rich Hall played him on Saturday Night Live - a clip I can&#39;t find right now - and also in this 1987 Showtime special I found on Youtube.   Time Magazine&#39;s obituary talks a bit about the Rich Hall piece on SNL: A salesman for himself and his vision of the American dream, he was also a master peddler of many products, whose makers were as loyal to Harvey as his listeners.</description>

      <description>As ever I am tracking the blueberry markets in anticipation of summer.
This from the Capital Press: Blueberry stocks in cold storage outpace past years; Berry dealers see bright side in large stocks of fruit
Frozen blueberries are selling at a steady clip, but carryover stocks from 2008&amp;rsquo;s crop are still huge, according to industry experts.
Sales seem to have picked up speed late last year, with warehouse stocks falling by 4 percent in October, 6 percent in November and 7 percent in December 2008, according to the USDA&amp;rsquo;s National Agricultural Statistics Service.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while you find a smallish wiki that looks like it&amp;#39;s healthy and has interesting material. &amp;#0160;These wikis are bigger than the single person brain-dump, and smaller than Wikipedia, and less abandoned than most temporary bouts of enthusiasm that bring people into wiki-land.
Inevitably when I find one of these I have the urge to edit and organize just long enough to figure out what kind of stuff is in it.</description>

      <description>Slate&amp;#39;s&amp;#0160;Farhad Manjoo&amp;#0160;wonders what the fuss was all about of the Internet of 1996:
I started thinking about the Web of yesteryear after I got an e-mail from an idly curious&amp;#0160;Slatecolleague: What did people do online back whenSlate&amp;#0160;launched, he wondered? After plunging into the&amp;#0160;Internet Archive&amp;#0160;and talking to several people who were watching the Web closely back then, I&amp;#39;ve got an answer: not very much.
Once you get past the &amp;quot;oh ha ha dancing cats&amp;quot; attitude of the article, you discover that the preserved online record of the World Wide Web circa 1996 is incomplete (at least as seen via the Internet Archive) and there&amp;#39;s really not that much to explain why people were interested in it.</description>

      <description>Brian Marick on How to get invited to conferences:
Someone asked me for advice on how to get invited to speak at conferences. &amp;#0160;Key advice:
 become a valuable participant in a niche field, grow along with the niche, become a good speaker.   &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;There&amp;#39;s more, of course; there&amp;#39;s always more; it&amp;#39;s a good discussion of how he found a growing niche and helped popularize it in part by viewing things from a novel perspective.</description>

      <description>why writing this? &amp;#0160;a query came in for it, in part because my &amp;quot;Detroit in the 1920s&amp;quot; post is popular, and of course the title of the blog. &amp;#0160;So here you go.
The Vintage Vacuum Cleaner Museum has a story with pictures of the Sears Energex, sold by Sears in the 1920s.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
The New Cleanness&amp;#0160;is a portion of Simply Switch On! &amp;#0160;A virtual museum of small early electrical appliances&amp;#0160;, which has good coverage of appliances from the UK.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve been blogging since April 1999; here&amp;#39;s the first month or so of posts. &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;They were edited oh so patiently with vi, and at the time the genre was new enough that I could say with confidence &amp;quot;Huh, this daily weblog stuff is too hard.</description>

      <description>Some references to collect here on the use of general-purpose graphic processors in OCR.&amp;#0160; Nominally, you run some kind of MapReduce based algorithm with a GPGPU over some image, and out spits text much faster than any ordinary processor of any speed; of course, there are lots of details to attend to.

      <description>I&amp;#39;m just going to keep posting about blueberries until I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s going to be summer again; I think we have a few tubs still in the freezer.
The search is for a blueberry muffin recipe with cardamom, and here&amp;#39;s some sample of same, to see what the variety is in the recipes so that perhaps some meta-recipe will emerge.&amp;#0160; Do be sure to read the first one through; it&amp;#39;s a moving memorial and a story of how we celebrate the end of someone&amp;#39;s life.</description>

People using Chi.mp will have identities that are importable, exportable, interoperable, portable and most importantly theirs. 
and I can&amp;#39;t help but think of this from the magazine In Formation #2, part of the late dot-com era: Every day computers are making people easier and easier to use.</description>

      <description>Pulled from the University of Maine Wild Blueberry Newsletter, January 2009:
Cultivated Blueberries
Total reported cultivated production in the United States reported by the USDA was 191.86 million pounds fresh and 156.8 million pounds processed for a total crop of 348.9 million pounds. In addition British Columbia, Canada had an average estimated cultivated crop of 70 million pounds despite the increase in the acreage. &amp;#0160;Michigan/Indiana had 113.8 million pounds which represents a bumper crop and greatly exceeds the 94.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s some notes about parallel computing, going in two directions at the same time.&amp;#0160; In one direction you have tools like Map/Reduce or Hadoop managing the work of parceling a problem into many pieces and then coordinating the collection of those pieces.&amp;#0160; In another direction you have graphics chips being turned into interesting general purpose parallel computing chips that can do some specific operations very fast.
It&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of clippings, in part because I don&amp;#39;t have a whole story yet, just the fragments.</description>

Here&amp;#39;s the links and notes I could find easily.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s prompted by the Ann Arbor Chronicle&amp;#39;s story about the city of Ann Arbor tree inventory going on now, which I hope will yield a precise map of where all of the public juneberry trees are.</description>

Poor markets delay construction of Michigan mine By JOHN FLESHER , 02.12.09, 05:25 PM EST        Construction of a proposed nickel and copper mine in Michigan&amp;#39;s Upper Peninsula is being delayed because of poor market conditions, its parent company said Thursday.
But project manager Jon Cherry said the announcement by London-based Rio Tinto Group  (nyse: RTP - news  - people ) does not mean the Kennecott Eagle mine is off the table.</description>

      <description>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&amp;#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&amp;#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&amp;#39;re concerned too.
The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&amp;#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.</description>

Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&amp;#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&amp;#39;re working on.</description>

Her introductory post spells out the reasons for blogging about school:
Sometimes I find the schools satisfactory, and sometimes not, but in general I have a lot of questions. Questions about why things run the way they do. Questions about whether things could run better. Critiques about the schools. Ideas to improve them.</description>

This is my notes from the LAC meeting of 2/10/09,
edited slightly but not intended as a faithful
transcript of the meeting.
I came in 10 minutes late; the meeting starts at
10:00am, and the AATA #6 from downtown gets there
at 10:01am. The meeting ends at 12:00 noon; the inbound #6 arrives at 11:58am.

Concerned citizens will get a chance on February 18 to voice their opinions on Kennecott&amp;rsquo;s plans to re-open the old Humboldt Mill at a public meeting hosted by Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality
Kennecott Minerals bought the property last September with plans to process ore from its proposed Eagle Project. Without legal permits to develop Eagle, the company continues to push permits for this processing facility, which was not part of the original mine plan.</description>

      <description>from &amp;quot;ruined by reading&amp;quot; -
I envied my older sister her uninterruptability. While I looked up immediately from my book when my name was called, she had the uncanny ability not to hear. I would test her as she read. It was like addressing a stone, except that with a stone, if we are imaginative enough, we can infer some kind of response albeit in stone language. My sister appeared to be present, but she was in the book.</description>

      <description>lifted straight from Matt Roush&amp;#39;s Great Lakes IT Report
Pasty Cam marks 4,000th straight daily item on the Web
Next Tuesday, Feb. 10, the Upper Peninsula&amp;#39;s Pasty Cam will publish its 4,000th consecutive daily picture and discussion. That&amp;#39;s nearly 11 years without missing a single day. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t know of any other daily feature Web site that has been around that long -- especially without missing a day. The daily cam is the brain child of Charlie Hopper, who fell in love with the Keweenaw as a kid at summer camp, and moved there for keeps in 1988 with his wife Edie and two kids after selling a software company.</description>

      <description>this post on &amp;quot;how twitter was born&amp;quot; is making the rounds; thanks to Prentiss Riddle for alerting me to it.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; The best quote from it is the use case that involves the worst possible internet device in the world: text messages from a mobile phone.
I remember that @Jack’s first use case was city-related: telling people that the club he’s at is happening. “I want to have a dispatch service that connects us on our phones using text.</description>

      <description>There are active volcanoes in Alaska, especially now including Mt. Redoubt.&amp;#0160; It appears likely to erupt as of this writing, and I&amp;#39;m not expecting to be on the top of things when it does.&amp;#0160; The Alaska Volcano Observatory is the best source of current information, and they are using twitter at @alaska_avo for updates.
Here are some sources for Alaska volcano maps - so you know where things are, how far apart the various places are, and what might be downwind.</description>

Dated 1/28/2009, 4pm; the image itself does not have any watermarks, copyrights, or other credits, so any conclusions you draw will be your own.&amp;#0160; It does clearly show the extent of the storm, though I don&amp;#39;t know if the no-damage areas are outside of this power company&amp;#39;s service area or if they are really undamaged.

      <description>From President Obama in his memo to the heads of federal agencies: A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency.&amp;#0160; As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”&amp;#0160; In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government.&amp;#0160; At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike.</description>

      <description>One of my very favorite weblogs from Michigan Tech is the aptly named Backyard Arthropod Project: A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI, which is written in a style that a professional metallurgist and amateur entomologist can do.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s hosted on somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com .
This week&amp;#39;s post is a very lovely photo set of a Canadian Tiger Swallowtail butterfly.&amp;#0160; The account of the identification of the Papilio canadensis is accompanied by a story of how it was collected, footnoted of course, with this note about the use of the word &amp;quot;snarge&amp;quot;:</description>

      <description>I purchase Trader Joe&amp;#39;s brand &amp;quot;Cheddar Wisconsin Mild&amp;quot; from the Ann Arbor store weekly on Sunday a.m.&amp;#0160; Inevitably the cheese has started to grow mold in the package by the time I use it mid-week, well before the sell-by date.&amp;#0160; The latest incident was this week&amp;#39;s moldy cheese with a sell-by date of Feb 11.
The UPC is 221563 502583 .
If I didn&amp;#39;t know better, I&amp;#39;d suspect that a cheese slicing machine was not cleaned frequently enough, introducing mold into the product where it is cut.</description>

UPDATE: the story is online; it references the link http://bit.ly/a2parking which points here.&amp;#0160; Still working on the complete how-to so that you could do this yourself, if you happened to have a parking garage of your own.</description>

      <description>A second try at menu plan Monday, written Sunday night.
Farmer&amp;#39;s market on Saturday was eggs, apples, some good conversation and not much more food.&amp;#0160; We didn&amp;#39;t get there early enough for fresh greens from Brines Farm, and by the time we were there Wasem&amp;#39;s was out of donuts.&amp;#0160; Still a lot of fun.
Food coop was pleasant, but I didn&amp;#39;t do most of my shopping there.&amp;#0160; Next week I&amp;#39;ll do shopping for spices there, since their selection is best and they are never out of stock of anything.</description>

      <description>Joy of Cooking, my go-to cookbook for some basic version of pretty much anything, has a recipe with anchovies for Green Goddess dressing.&amp;#0160; While I like anchovies, I really don&amp;#39;t cook with them at home.&amp;#0160; So I&amp;#39;m looking for alternatives for that same style dressing that use something else in its place.
Some suggestions:
for anchovies, substitute tarragon;
for anchovies, substitute miso or fermented black beans;
bacobits;

      <description>From the Frog Blog: Cold weather leads to price hikes (1/9/2009)
Blueberries--now for some good news. Blueberry prices hit rock bottom this weekend. I can&amp;#39;t imagine they could get this cheap in the winter. Prices could be as low as $15 per case. 
I&amp;#39;ll be following the twitter stream of EuroFruit to get more details as well; country of origin might be Chile?

      <description>Thanks all for your suggestions; I gave them my 4 minutes. Here&amp;#39;s what I said.
 1. &amp;#0160;Not going to talk about the Link Bus and how bad the signage is; I did my own pocket schedule and now I&amp;#39;m OK.&amp;#0160; This is not the right board to give that feedback to.
 2. &amp;#0160;Not going to talk about how the AATA Ridetrak is down and how it&amp;#39;s been down for a month; that&amp;#39;s a message to the AATA board, not this board.</description>

      <description>Matt Hampel has released a study of Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Community Television Network.&amp;#0160; He writes about an organization that was innovative and forward-looking in the 1970s that is now running with little public oversight and with only the most tentative ways of engaging with the public through networks other than cable television.
Most notable in the whole discussion is a comparison of CTN&amp;#39;s video archiving and online access system with a similar setup at the Ann Arbor District Library.</description>

      <description>if you have too many legos on the floor, here&amp;#39;s the patented design for picking them up:
A toy cleanup vacuum attachment which can be used easily by attaching to household vacuum hose for the quick and efficient clean up of a plurality of different size and shape plastic building block toys. The toy cleanup vacuum attachment compromises: a curved suction channel for sucking up plastic toy building blocks; a convex plate guide with vent holes which guides the plastic building block toys within a suction channel into a drop channel while allowing the passage of vacuum current and dust; a rectangular drop channel through which plastic building block toys pass from the force of vacuum momentum and gravity; a transparent collection container for housing the plastic building block toys during cleanup and an air-tight bottom, hinged lid for conducting quick and simple dropping of plastic building block toys back into a toy box; a spring loaded push/twist thumb button agitator for dislodging clogged or stuck plastic building block toys; a grip handle for ease of use and.</description>

      <description>It was a dark and stormy night.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, the power went out.
The biggest effect: 210,000 DTE customers all over SE Michigan went dark.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s a piece of the map to give you an idea - click through for current map.
The best DTE site for updates seems to be mobile.dteenergy.com, as much as there is a &#34;best&#34;.
 The biggest side effect of this was an outage of the AT&amp;amp;T mobile network and as a result the iPhone network.</description>

      <description>When the AATA mobile ride track is up, I have a script that runs periodically to decode the web pages and turn them into data.&amp;#0160; The pages are formatted for humans, so I need to do screen scraping on them to reconstruct the original data values.
There are a lot of tools for screen scraping, with each of them appealing to a programmer who has a certain world view of the web and how things are put together.</description>

      <description>While waiting for the AATA&amp;#39;s mobile ridetrak system to go back online (it&amp;#39;s been down for two weeks now due to a series of unfortunate events), I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about how to model the network of bus and pedestrian routes so that you could say some useful things about the goodness of a given route network for a particular task at a particular time of day.&amp;#0160; What I&amp;#39;m after is understanding just how far I can reasonably go from where I am to somewhere else useful based on bus routes, my willingness or ability to walk, and the minute by minute information about how late the bus is.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&amp;#0160; (&amp;quot;Twitter zero&amp;quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&amp;#0160; It seemed like a good plan, Dunbar number and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&amp;#0160; The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&amp;#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&amp;#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&amp;#39;s advertising there sponsoring it.</description>

      <description>Detroit has a new weather radar offering what the Weather Underground calls &amp;quot;high def radar&amp;quot;.&amp;#0160; Here&amp;#39;s the link to the TDWR Radar for Detroit.
The vendor&amp;#39;s web site, TSC, says
The Federal Aviation Administration&amp;#39;s (FAA) Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) system detects and reports hazardous weather in and around airport terminal approach and departure zones. The TDWR identifies and warns air traffic controllers (ATCs) of low altitude wind shear hazards caused by microbursts and their associated gust fronts, in addition to reporting on precipitation intensities and providing advanced warning of wind shifts.</description>

      <description>Some collected thoughts on serendipity.
serendipity in book-finding: (via if:book)
the pinpoint accuracy of computer-searches, leaves those of us lucky enough to have spent time in library stacks, nostalgic for the unexpected discovery of something we didn&amp;#39;t know we were looking for but which just happened, serendipitously, to be on a nearby shelf.
Lindsay Marshall on serendipity:
We are not, I believe, looking for tools to record our thoughts or to provide them with structure.</description>

      <description>thanks to Paul Hartzog for the connection.
A new book on its way on the post-automotive era; quoting their release page in its entirety.
After the Car By: John Urry (Lancaster University) and Kingsley DENNIS.    Description It is difficult to imagine a world without the car, and yet that is exactly what Dennis and Urry set out to do in this provocative new book. They argue that the days of the car are numbered: powerful forces around the world are undermining the car system and will usher in a new transport system sometime in the next few decades.</description>

 &amp;quot;Iron ore docks of the Great Lakes&amp;quot;
 Pocket ore docks are monumental structures used to transfer iron ore from railway cars traveling from nearby mines to ships that carry the ore to steelmaking centers or transfer points on the Lower Great Lakes. These structures were constructed from wood, steel, or reinforced concrete.</description>

      <description>LONG-LOST OPERATIC FRAGMENT COMES TO LIGHT
 During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music community even this crumbling shard of Verde&amp;#39;s never-performed Il Internetto.</description>

Two weeks ahead of time, get notified by Plaxo by email.&amp;#0160; That gives you enough time to update the email and postal address and send a postcard.&amp;#0160; (Note: the &amp;quot;everyone gets a postcard&amp;quot; bit is something I aspire to; still haven&amp;#39;t figured out all of the infrastructure yet, though I have a postcard project to track what I can.</description>

      <description>The joke of course is that most of what passes for Mexican food outside of Mexicantown is really something else, and that there&amp;#39;s a lot of bland or just plain weird vaguely hispanic cuisine that gets sold as &amp;quot;mexican food&amp;quot; but is better described as &amp;quot;Mich-Mex&amp;quot;.&amp;#0160; e.g. &amp;quot;there are no good burritos in Michigan&amp;quot;.
The kids were hungry tonight, and I had enough ingredients in the fridge to put a hot plate full of food for them in less than 25 minutes.</description>

      <description>I have an index card stuck in my copy of Anne Lamott&amp;rsquo;s Bird By Bird. In that essay, she exhorts the reader to write down the ideas and thoughts and clever lines of dialog and whatever else they want to remember on a handy index card (carry one, folded, in your back pocket so you don&amp;rsquo;t look bulky). I just reread it out loud to myself, and now I kick myself for not having recorded myself to listen to it again (not for you all mind you, just for me).</description>

I&amp;#39;m not used to doing grocery shopping, but going with the boys helps since they have been doing it all along.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;I am a leader by default, because nature abhors a vacuum.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Desmond Tutu, quoted in the Christian Science Monitor, Dec 20 1984.
&amp;quot;The real leader has no need to lead - he is content to point the way.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Henry Miller, from his essay The Wisdom of the Heart, 1947.
&amp;quot;Only in the frictionless vacuum of a nonexistent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict.&amp;quot;&amp;#0160; Saul Alinsky, 1971</description>

      <description>In recent days a number of modestly successful online social and productivity services have been scheduled for decommisioning. Pownce is being turned off as that team moves to Six Apart, and I Want Sandy is going away as Rael moves to Twitter. You will see more systems get acquired and shut down with graceful exits, and some exits will not be so graceful.
There seem to be multiple common reasons why upstart systems get wiped out in times of economic crisis.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s winter, your hands see cold so you are wearing gloves, but you need at least a few fingers free for your mobile phone. What designs work?
The gloves I am wearing now have a flap to expose a sort of fingerless Mitten, and if I fold things right I can expose just two index fingers. I could imagine thumbs free gloves too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m writing this from my mobile phone, using typepad mobile to post with. As a blog post interface it works pretty well.  There is one key piece that is missing to make it more helpful: a search function. I don&amp;#39;t see a way to easily search through my past posts from the phone to go back and update and edit one of them. It is easy to get to the last 5 posts but the next option is to list all 1900 entries, no thanks.</description>

      <description>http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/031507/milk.html
Ever wondered how to milk a spider? In this video, Dr. Greta Binford, a researcher at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon, extracts venom from a sleeping spider&amp;#39;s fangs. 
http://www.kgw.com/news/specialreports/stories//kgw_042707_special_news_spider_woman.146f5fbf.html
 Greta Binford, however, has slightly less cooperative subjects. Binford collects venom from the world&amp;#39;s most dangerous spiders.   Binford jokes she has &amp;quot;the dream job of most 8-year-old boys. I sit and watch spiders catch bugs.</description>

      <description>Ten of us met for lunch at Kai Garden on Friday, Nov 21 to help plan Arbcamp, which is coming up the evening of December 18, 2008 in Ann Arbor.&amp;#0160; I had the Mongolian beef and egg drop soup; Dug ordered a round of scallion pancakes.
Here&amp;#39;s a summary (or not).
Dug Song summed up the discussion at the end including:
Schedule: how the event will be structured, how much time we have, how many parallel tracks can happen, how to accomodate both short &amp;quot;lightning&amp;quot; style talks and longer sessions, how to wrap up at the end.</description>

      <description>You&amp;#39;re at a meeting, somewhere, and you want to quietly and unobtrusively take meeting notes or some other record of the meeting while it&amp;#39;s happening, and you have a mobile phone but nothing else.
What tool or application do you use?
Mobile twitter.&amp;#0160; Twitter your short notes out to the world, or use a direct message to some bot of some kind that collects and gathers the notes for you.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; Twitter&amp;#39;s mobile interface is fast, simple, and reasonably complete.</description>

There&amp;#39;s now a copy of The Brain for the Mac, and I pulled it down this afternoon to help someone work on a presentation where they need to make sense of a whole semester&amp;#39;s worth of interconnected ideas.</description>

      <description>Achieving Extraordinary Organizational Performance Through Diversity
Professor Scott Page, University of Michigan
Friday, November 21, 1-2:15 p.m.
Founders Room, Alumni Center
200 Fletcher
Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&amp;#39;s predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&amp;#39;re talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why diversity trumps ability.</description>

UPDATE2: analytics for wiki edit failure
Google Analytics has a bunch of new features.&amp;#0160; Mediawiki, the code that runs Arborwiki, has Google Analytics installed and is tracking user behavior to help improve the quality and relevance of the content that&amp;#39;s there.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve seen lots of electoral maps, with the US colored various shades of red, blue, or purple. The simplest ones just colorize the map; the most complex distort the map and refine the color space to show various aspects of the population, its voting patterns and changes over time. Jason Kottke has a good collection of 2008 election maps from all over the world, showing mostly the state of real time map software by newspapers, web sites, and television updated during the vote count.</description>

      <description>Mark Maynard, Ypsilanti, November 2008: Cafe Luwak
This month, the MM.com special can be found at&amp;#0160;Cafe Luwak, where, if you buy one sandwich, you’ll get one free… And the same goes for those urban elitist coffee drinks known as lattes… Seriously, how better to celebrate an Obama win in Michigan than with the official drink of the liberal elite?

      <description>on time tracking, in general, an observation from last year:

It&amp;#39;s hard to have great weird ideas when you&amp;#39;re tracking every minute to determine who it gets billed to. The cognitive overhead of deciding which part of your brain gets dinged for each good thought gets in the way of flow.
My days have a lot more specific time points where something needs to happen at a certain time, no compromises.</description>

      <description>Part of a Wiki Wednesday series; this post is NOT FINISHED but I needed to post it anyway.
Using a wiki to help develop and edit text for your project is appealing because when it all works you can, when everything works right, get a lot more done with less document management overhead. &amp;#0160; However, there is a large group of professionals who regularly work with complex documents who are intimately familiar with Microsoft Word, are experts in understanding how it can be used to build complex and attractive deliverables, and for whom a wiki environment is novel - not just because the mechanics of editing, change tracking, and formatting for presentation are different, but because the model for how people work together in this world is not the same.</description>

      <description>Holiday traffic is seasonal, and we are in the post-Halloween, post-election, pre-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas season now.&amp;#0160; Just look at the typical retail display which is already showing holiday stuff.
Based on a study of the last three year&amp;#39;s worth of traffic to this blog, here&amp;#39;s some things you can anticipate me writing between now and the end of November, in part because I&amp;#39;ll write it down because I need to know it, and in part because it&amp;#39;s just that time of the year.</description>

      <description>Quite a few cafe networks have filters set up to block various kinds of use.&amp;#0160; My usual failure modes with these are that they mark perfectly reasonable internet services as inappropriate.
Here&amp;#39;s a litany of Panera complaints, to give you a feel for it.
Tinotopia was blocked for a while, which got the author riled up enough to document some of the failures.&amp;#0160; No entries since April 2005:
In this case, Tino of all people is the loser: for he has once again been suckered into coming into Panera only to find that the network is kaput.</description>

      <description>This 1948 collection of essays about the changing of the seasons in Wisconsin was on my parents bookshelf, and sits on mine in the dining room where various bits of natural history live.
 There is an essay or three for each month.&amp;#0160; Here&amp;#39;s some part of November captured in words as &amp;quot;If I Were The Wind&amp;quot;
The wind that makes music in November corn is in a hurry.&amp;#0160; The stalks hum, the loose husks whisk skyward in half-playful whirls, and the wind hurries on.</description>

      <description>Since it&amp;#39;s game day (Michigan at Minnesota) I thought I&amp;#39;d link to at least a few connections between Michigan and Minnesota.
1.&amp;#0160; The Little Brown Jug is the trophy that goes back and forth between the two schools depending on which one wins the game.&amp;#0160; It was originally purchased as a water jug for the Michigan team on an away game to Minnesota in 1903, it was left behind after the game (a 6-6 tie).</description>

      <description>Along with all of the other t-shirts (Michigan Beer Pong, Michigan Undecided) for sale on State Street before football games, a new one has appeared this year:&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;2008 Worst Season Ever&amp;rdquo;.
Not being one to quarrel with a t-shirt, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go back through history and see just how bad this year&amp;rsquo;s team is compared to teams of the past.

      <description>There was a brief interlude after Halloween to allow for Election Season, but then all of the orange-themed holiday items were swept away from the stores and are now replaced by green and red themed holiday items.&amp;#0160; (New packaging, same stuff.)&amp;#0160; That was what it looked like both at Kroger and at Caribou Coffee yesterday, quite disconcerting to go with the 60+ degree weather.
Kroger had a large clock up in view of the checkout lanes with a countdown timer until Christmas, something like this one (except a lot cheaper).</description>

0. Party in the streets!

Election reporting is perhaps the best reason to look at cloud computing as a system for dealing with peak load needs.</description>

There were ... people in attendance, a turnout (helped, hurted) in part by a (rare) promotion of the event on Facebook.&amp;#0160; Facebook doesn&amp;#39;t have a repeating event structure, so to do this regularly I&amp;#39;d have to type it in every week; perhaps it&amp;#39;s worth that, perhaps not, I don&amp;#39;t know.</description>

Organized by Zach Steindler and Matt Pizzimenti, this group when I visited last week was mostly current and recent UM engineering students, with a few people from out of town visiting old friends.</description>

      <description>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly part of the same easy to define train of thought. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;note to self&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;note to future self&amp;rdquo;, for the sorts of things that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again. It&amp;rsquo;s notes about places I&amp;rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&amp;rsquo;d like to go to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get interested enough in something to write down what I find out about it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that find it (and more) so I can learn more.</description>

County offices - the county clerk, Larry Kestenbaum, is hosting an election night at the county offices (Main and Ann) with vote reporting, food, local politicos, what passes for a press corps, and probably a few bloggers.&amp;#0160; Starts at 8pm, non-partisan.</description>

      <description>Twitter is using an octothorpetag #votereport to mark voting reports today.&amp;#0160; There&amp;#39;s several systems downstream processing and mapping that data.&amp;#0160; See e.g. votereport.us (simple log), twittervotereport.com (map), and the Twitter vote report wiki (details for media and developers).
You can also get a pretty good point of view via Twitter just searching for the string Ann Arbor.

      <title>Baked Polenta: &#34;no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup - possible but unlikely&#34;</title>

      <description>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to do that.&amp;#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the delicious tag polenta, from the blog Hungry Cravings - the so called Cheater Method Polenta.
The critics were skeptical:
Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck!
but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that.</description>

      <description>(from the ICOS mailing list)
Join ICOS this Friday to hear from Wendy Espeland of Northwestern’s Sociology Department. &amp;#0160;Espeland has developed the concept of commensuration in markets—efforts to value diverse things in a common
metric, from finance and human organs to environmental degradation. &amp;#0160;Her talk this week examines the effect of widely-publicized US News &amp;amp; World Report rankings on law schools and their conception of legal education.

      <description>Recipe credit: freddyknits, who writes about knitting (and importantly takes pictures of projects).
This recipe comes close to what you&amp;#39;ll find as the soup in any of the middle eastern restaurants around town - easy to make (10 minutes chopping at the beginning), forgiving, easy to make in quantity, and sustaining on days when you get the first snow of the season.
You&amp;#39;ll want to keep red lentils in stock in your pantry so that you can always make this soup in a pinch.</description>

1.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&amp;#0160; If you&amp;#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&amp;#39;ll understand.&amp;#0160; Locally this means that the first day of blueberry, raspberry, juneberry, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</description>

      <description>This is not medical advice; you refer to more trusted sources than blog postings for health care.
That said, I&amp;#39;m taking some notes to share.
Hand Food and Mouth Disease, from the Center for Disease Control
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth (also called hoof-and-mouth) disease, a disease of cattle, sheep, and swine; however, the two diseases are not related—they are caused by different viruses.</description>

lemon juice
no white wine before noon on Sunday
Wash and trim the green beans, chop the tomatoes, smash the garlic.
Heat the oil in a big pan, saute the garlic, add the green beans, add the tomatoes.&amp;#0160; Sprinkle on dried basil.
At some point the tomatoes will cook enough that the bottom of the pan will start to have browned tomatoey bits.</description>

The last few times I have gone through this there have been problems.&amp;nbsp; The first time, I gave up and voted on a regular machine; the second time, I figured things out in time to vote with it.</description>

      <title>Scrambled eggs with slow roasted tomatoes (炒鸡蛋西红柿)</title>

      <description>I did the slow roasting during high tomato season, and there are a few quarts of them in the freezer.
Wondering which recipes would show up for a search for &amp;quot;recipe egg tomato&amp;quot; on Twitter, I ended up much to my surprise on a Beijing travel web site, which had a recipe for Fried Egg and Tomato – Chǎo Jīdàn Xīhóngshì – 炒鸡蛋西红柿.
Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing.</description>

      <description>some notes for a project that my oldest is doing -
from the Michigan DNR: Landowner&amp;rsquo;s Guide, Bats
The  little brown bat is especially abundant throughout the state and is the most seen species. A light brown to dark brown in color, little browns are fairly small in size with a wingspan of 8 1&amp;frasl;2 to 11 1&amp;frasl;2 inches, small ears, and large feet. In summer, colonies of the species live in hot attics and under shingles and siding; in winter, they hibernate in caves, crevices, houses, hollow trees, or mines.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Kill your television.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Quoting Robert Efroymson&#39;s long since abandoned home page at U Minnesota:
My favorite reason for not watching TV is that it has a fixed, low bandwidth.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t watch tv fast or slow, you have to watch it at the rate the show goes, which could very well be much slower than you can accept the information (or much faster).&amp;nbsp; A book you can read at your own pace, a tv show sets the pace for you.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s that time of year.&amp;#0160; Ballot information:
Washtenaw County&amp;#39;s Washtenaw Votes site has complete details about precinct locations etc.
The State of Michigan&amp;#39;s Web Voter Information Center will spit out your personal sample ballot, if you are registered in a particular place; there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be an easy way to get a sample ballot for an arbitrary location.
The City of Ann Arbor has a detailed page of voting information and a voting FAQ online.</description>

The World Spider Catalog is a thorough catalog of the scientific literature regarding spiders, with a special attention paid to classification and taxonomy.&amp;nbsp; The organization of the entries is hierarchically determined; hence synonymies at the &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; generic level are indicated under the family (and cross-referenced under the appropriate &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; generic) listings, but affected species are listed separately only if there are significant &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; references to them in particular.</description>

From &amp;quot;coolest homemade costumes dot com&amp;quot; in their home appliances section:
My husband started with an empty box, free from the grocery store and cut it down to fit her. He then wrapped it in some black vinyl, attached some parts from old vacuums we had in the garage (handle, hose and attachment, caddy with brushes).</description>

      <description>In Australia, they go on sale in September (!):&amp;nbsp; From the Australian Newsagency Blog

Our calendar sales in September were up 72% at Forest Hill and 37% at Frankston.
At Forest Hill the increase is driven by having a solid range on display early in the calendar season.
At Frankston it is thanks to a new point of difference - previously this store focused on magazine distributor calendars. We are focused on a more unique range of titles.</description>

      <description>Every week on Thursday I host a lunch at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor; you&#39;re invited.&amp;nbsp; One regular element of that lunch is helping figure out what events are happening the upcoming weekend and weeks ahead so that people can find help in publicizing those events or tell people about something they are looking forward to.
I&#39;ve tried a zillion difficult ways to keep the calendar for that group, none of which are ideal, mostly because they involve some kind of calendar system which requires more precision than I have time to deal with and which makes me type things into fields.</description>

      <description>A follow up on the earlier post about the commercialization of the internet -
Once the basic data infrastructure of the Internet was open to commercial use - which starts in late 1991, and accelerates rapidly from there - you start to get slowly and then at a rapidly accelerating pace the appearance of businesses online who are selling things to people directly.
Some milestones there as well:
1993: Fry Multimedia launches web sites for Godiva, Ragu; mostly marketing and advertising not sales.</description>

      <description>A friend asks, &amp;quot;when did the Internet go commercial&amp;quot;?&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.
1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds
1989: Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.
1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.
1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet</description>

      <description>Bubble wrap!&amp;nbsp; Who knew.
Build It Solar has the super-easy instructions, which involve cutting the wrap to the size of the window, spraying a thin film of water on the window, and letting the bubble wrap stick.&amp;nbsp; Add a little glycerin perhaps if you have trouble removing it in the spring.
It&#39;s apparently a common practice in the greenhouse industry.
And it&#39;s more transparent and high tech than duct taping some foam insulation to the window.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know if anyone makes this, but I think it would be helpful.&amp;nbsp; Rough specifications:
- usb powered; plugs into your laptop
- some kind of secure clip or clamp attaches to your laptop screen
- bright led lighting designed to deal with seasonal affective disorder
This product page has some plausible options from Gentron Telecom in Taiwan; I can&#39;t find ordering or pricing, so these may be designs available for use but not in actual production.</description>

      <description>We have a patch of land that should be doing something productive but instead is growing Japanese Knotweed.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d like to fix that.
The simple description of how to deal with it seems to be to smother the affected area (using tarps or old carpets) and to do container gardening on top of that ground cover.&amp;nbsp; (ref about.com)
It&#39;s time to think about it now, because I know that come May, it&#39;ll be growing with wild abandon.</description>

      <description>from the Randy Pausch lecture on time management, which I looked at 100 days ago:  And do a time journal, and if that&#39;s really too much effort, just count the number of hours you watch of television in the next week. That&#39;s my gift to you.
 The last thing is, once you&amp;rsquo;ve got your day-timer, make a note for 30 days from today - it&amp;rsquo;s okay if that one goes &amp;quot;ding&amp;quot; to remind you!</description>

My name is Sarah and I’m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a spider with a body about 3&amp;frasl;4 an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the spider is only there during evening and night.</description>

      <description>For a bunch of reasons which I don&#39;t completely understand, there are gasoline shortages in the Atlanta area.
The net is responding by using the #atlgas tag on Twitter to coordinate real time information about the location and availability of gasoline.&amp;nbsp; To look at it the easiest way is through the twitter search for #atlgas.&amp;nbsp; Some recent examples -
 wheelmom: #atlgas BP at I-85 and Clairmont. $4.39(!) Barely a wait.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place in the time between the Solstices &amp;amp; Equinoxes and their following new moons. Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&amp;rsquo;t buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that you have enough.</description>

      <description>One way to get high density storage without creating building-wide cooling issues is to move your computing and storage facilities into a container which can be housed out of the building.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m looking at specs for some various systems to do this, optimized for storage density, to see what the expectations might be for what you&#39;d get in &amp;quot;petabytes per container&amp;quot;.
The answer appears to be &amp;quot;about one petabyte per six linear feet of container&amp;quot;, or put another way, &amp;quot;about one petabyte per ten cubic meters of containerized storage.</description>

      <description>Party like it&#39;s what year?
The characteristics which distinguish a panic of that character from those smaller financial convulsions and industrial set-backs which are of constant occurrence on speculative markets, are five in number: First, a credit crisis so acute as to involve the holding back of payment of cash by banks to depositors, and the momentary suspension of practically all credit facilities. Second, the general hoarding of money by individuals, through withdrawal of great sums of cash from banks, thereby depleting bank reserves, involving runs of depositors on banks, and, in this country, bringing about an actual premium on currency.</description>

      <description>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans Fabricius) on September 7, 2008.&amp;nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&amp;nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System&#39;s Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.
The best news article on this is from the Greenville, MI Daily News, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.</description>

Wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm That blew all the people away! Their trumpets gave them warning, &amp;quot;You&#39;d better leave this place.&amp;quot; They never thought of leaving Till death looked them in the face.</description>

      <description>Biscuits are easy to make, if you have the right recipe, especially the right recipe as amended several times over.&amp;nbsp; This recipe originates in a cookbook that I couldn&#39;t find the last time I made biscuits (hence this post, so I can find it again).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
The &amp;quot;bunny cutter&amp;quot; is an appropriately sized and shaped cookie cutter.&amp;nbsp; You may need to experiment with whatever is at hand.&amp;nbsp; When I made a different recipe (Joy of Cooking) that used (lots of) butter instead of oil, I used a different cutter, just to be sure that everyone knew there was a difference.</description>

One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&amp;nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head.</description>

      <description>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s simple advice: don&#39;t post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate.
This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page.</description>

Sauce:
A little olive oil
Several tomatoes, cut into quarters or smaller
Dried basil, only because you got to market too late to get fresh
Heat the olive oil in a pan.&amp;nbsp; Add the quartered tomatoes - don&#39;t bother to skin or peel or seed them.</description>

      <description>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging.
If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new.
Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably &#39;best answer&#39; for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG.</description>

      <description>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging.
The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic.
By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&amp;nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you&#39;ve done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things.</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor Chronicle has appeared on the scene.&amp;nbsp; Here are some early reviews.
The Vassar Miscelleny of 1872 writes:
 The Yale Literary Magazine opines:

The Yale Literary Magazine&amp;nbsp; By Yale University
Finally, the Hamilton Literary Magazine has its say in 1885:

Hamilton Literary Magazine&amp;nbsp; By Hamilton College (Clinton,&amp;nbsp; N.Y.)
Early reviews are priceless.&amp;nbsp; Best of luck to the new editorial team.</description>

      <description>Whenever the power goes out, there&#39;s a burst of search traffic by people to try to figure out what is going on and when the lights will be back on.
Lots of utility companies have outage management systems which provide some widely varied amount of information about what&#39;s going on - there&#39;s a bunch of vendors, no obvious standards being used, and even file formats and page styles are all over the place.</description>

      <description>While it&#39;s still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net&#39;s response to Hurricane Gustav.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not putting a lot of links in this post.
--
Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.</description>

      <description>People have started to evacuate New Orleans and the Gulf coast.
Here&#39;s a map I&#39;ve been keeping over the course of the afternoon with some information about destinations where people are ending up at.
It&#39;s incomplete (of course) but gives you some idea of scope.&amp;nbsp; Nancy White has a good list of other web based Gustav resources.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Grace has some details specific to hurricane evacuation planning.  View Larger Map</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a video of the Warren Easton HS marching band in New Orleans, LA:
  This is a band that was basically wiped out by Hurricane Katrina, and Bart notes their restart in 2006 after Katrina.
Like a lot of people we are watching from afar for the projected path through the Gulf of Gustav to hope it isn&#39;t a repeat.&amp;nbsp; Unlike Katrina, this time around there&#39;s twitter; see the twitter stream of people talking about Gustav.</description>

If you want it to go faster look at this:

      <description>Google&#39;s AdSense program is designed to provide relevant targeted advertising content to web pages.&amp;nbsp; It works, sometimes intermittently, on weblogs - but there&#39;s often enough other non-relevant things on the design of those pages to work only indifferently.&amp;nbsp; What you do find however is that the appropriately targeted wiki design - especially one where the subject matter expertise of a professional association is involved, and where the words in use a specific to a field of specialty - yields extremely targeted results.</description>

The Reverse Engineers have a song &amp;quot;Mercury in Retrograde&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s a $0.99 download from Amazon.
The lyrics match the problem.

      <description>I try to ask this question every year at least, because the answers change all the time; it was the topic of this week&#39;s a2b3 meeting.&amp;nbsp; Here are some things people shared.
Many people were using Google Calendar for shared calendaring - not just one calendar, but multiple calendars, and someone said they had 20 different calendars.&amp;nbsp; There was one part the need to keep personal and work calendars separate, one part the desire to subdivide work calendars into multiple slices to be shared on a per-project basis, and one part to synchronize home and work and family and kids and school.</description>

      <description>The a2b3 meeting today at Eastern Accents had 26 or so, again filling as many tables as we could manage to reasonably fill.&amp;nbsp; I asked the question &amp;quot;How do you keep your calendar&amp;quot; and got a full round of answers, as many as you would ever need.
The meeting is at the edge of what the venue can handle, but I want to keep inviting new people to it (every Thursday; you&#39;re invited).</description>

      <description>I use LinkedIn for Groups to manage the Cisco Alumni Association group.&amp;nbsp; One of the qualification steps is that you have to have worked for Cisco in the past (and you&#39;d be surprised how many people apply who haven&#39;t any connection at all).
 The admin UI for that system is clumsy if you have to approve and delete a lot of people - basically there&#39;s no built-in support for checking someone out short of opening up a whole new window with their profile.</description>

      <description>These are projected, estimated, possible, or likely prices for Michigan football parking for 2008.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s based on the dataset I collected from the 2007 football season, which as you might recall had an unfortunate start (which definitely impacted prices).

View Larger Map

It needs better icons so you don&#39;t have to decode the color chart.&amp;nbsp; Typically prices can vary $5 from week to week depending on the game, and if all goes well it will rain on a Thursday so that the golf course is closed and thus neighborhood parking is at a premium.</description>

The key idea here (so far poorly executed, but I&#39;ll get it right) is to replace the stop letters with stop numbers, and to number the stops by the number of minutes after the quarter hour that the bus is expected.</description>

You know it&#39;s time for school to start when the next projects on your fun list are the new Link Bus schedule, the football parking prices map, the 3d grade start of school picnic and the daycare potluck.</description>

      <description>As seen in the Duke University news:Little Teeth Suggest Big Jump in Primate Timeline
DURHAM, NC -- Tiny fossilized teeth excavated from an Indian open-pit coal mine could be the oldest Asian remains ever found of anthropoids, the primate lineage of today&#39;s monkeys, apes and humans, say researchers from Duke University and the Indian Institute of Technology.
Just 9-thousandths of a square inch in size, the teeth are about 54.5 million years old and suggest these early primates were no larger than modern dwarf lemurs weighing about 2 to 3 ounces.</description>

SuperMemo is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&amp;nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.</description>

The blueberries melt into the stock producing the most delectable, mahogany colored broth and a fragrance the fills the house with the scents of fall. 
We&#39;re vegetarians at home, so this is going to have to be someone else&#39;s potluck dish. There&#39;s buffalo raised in Michigan at Sprik Farms near Grand Rapids, and at TMZ Farm near Pinckney.</description>

      <description>The primaries in Michigan are tomorrow, August 5 2008.
If you want a sample ballot, go to the Michigan Voter Information Center run by the Michigan Secretary of State. You&#39;ll put in your voter information, and it will come up with a list of elections on the ballot. Publius also generates Michigan sample ballots, as does the MLive Voter Guide.
The list of Washtenaw County precinct locations is kept by the County Clerk and Register of Deeds, Larry Kestenbaum.</description>

      <description>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota. From a profile of Jim Johnson by writer Cheryl Reitan in the mnartists.org site:
 JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.</description>

      <description>Link to Cindy Kallet and Grey Larson on NPR (no way to embed, sadly). It&#39;s a 6 minute segment.  Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. &amp;ldquo;It has the string sound of a viola,&amp;rdquo; Kallet says, &amp;ldquo;and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it&amp;rsquo;s small enough that I can handle it easily.</description>

Bob Lilienfeld from Use Less Stuff has a good and thorough paper vs. plastic lifecycle research analysis to understand some perspective on the levels of tradeoffs involved in the decision.

      <description>In the manage by numbers world...
One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress. At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.
If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you&#39;d measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time.</description>

from &#39;bill says this&#39;:

But here&#39;s some critical information to limit the damage in case this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).</description>

The name of the place is not really bug camp; it&#39;s the Page Center in Little Lake, MI:

Our peaceful, natural setting on Little Lake is the perfect place for your next retreat, reunion, wedding, reception or workshop. Located 3 miles East of M-35/553, approximately 24 miles south of Marquette.

It&#39;s a nice spot, a former church camp, with a lovely main house, a dining hall and kitchen, and eight bunk cabins.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a bit of science fiction I&#39;d like to read -
The time is the future, but the near future, within reach - perhaps 2012. The hero has some kind of cognitive deficit that&#39;s progressive, so that they are slowly losing their ability to reason. (Think Flowers for Algernon, for instance.)
The twist is that the nature of the loss of thinking is that they are fine in person and in everything they normally do, but that they are unable to effectively use search engines any more.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s blueberry season, and so one of the things you want to do is buy some berries. Here&#39;s how.
For stock photography, Featurepix has a photo of fresh Michigan blueberries on a bush; the original photo is $4. Another wild blueberries on the bush photo from istockphoto is 10 credits (quatloos? rubles? I don&#39;t know the exchange rate).
At retail, Busch&#39;s in Ann Arbor is currently selling them for $14.99 for a 5 pound box, or $1.</description>

I&#39;ve just read to the section on blueberries where they find a patch of beautiful, fat juicy ones only to discover that they are being grown for a local Buddhist temple and are not for sale.

      <description>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS
By John Clark
My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal.</description>

Along the way, I got this suggestion, which I share:

&#34;If you&#39;re looking for &#34;telegraph literature&#34; (i.e. stories involving telegraphs) then you should certainly read &#34;The Telegraph Girl&#34; by Anthony Trollope and an accompanying article &#34;The Young Women at the London Telegraph Office&#34; and then Kipling&#39;s story &#34;</description>

      <description>From time to time people ask questions about Ann Arbor, and from time to time there are what appear to be encyclopedic responses to them. Part of the reason for this is Arborwiki, a wiki that covers information about Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Washtenaw County and the rest of the area.
Matt Hampel runs this with an ad hoc collective doing editorial direction and the Ann Arbor District Library providing hosting. It&#39;s not advertising driven, and while is has a lot of information about businesses any obviously marketing copy gets edited out pretty quickly.</description>

We are not generally a cocktails household, so part of the corresponding challenge is giving people some sense of what do to with the jar to help them enjoy it.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&amp;quot; (Jack Shedd)
Jack has more in a rant that&amp;#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &amp;quot;cheese food manufacturing&amp;quot; that Merlin Mann observes as dominating the world of &amp;quot;pro bloggers&amp;quot;.
In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &amp;quot;pick any two&amp;quot; is the easiest answer. It&amp;#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system.</description>

It&#39;s just about blueberry picking season here near Ann Arbor and all over the state of Michigan.
There are two farms that I know about in easy driving distance of Ann Arbor. The Dexter Blueberry Farm is in Dexter on Beach Road north of Dexter-Chelsea Road; when I called yesterday they said about a week, so call ahead to (734)426-2900 to confirm.</description>

Some estimates or measures:
If you are using solid state memory (no disk; just memory, configured as disk) from Texas Memory Systems, expect to have 2.5 KW/TB, or 0.4 TB/KW:</description>

      <description>Drought Severity Index by Region from NOAA for the week ending 21 June 2008
It&#39;s fire season (at least in the places where it isn&#39;t flood or landslide season) and the best way to be ready for a fire is to not have the fire start at all.
Here&#39;s a collection of Michigan fire maps, and some additional resources to help get to current information about what&#39;s going on.</description>

      <description>via the V. V. Mayakovsky bio in the Encyclopedia of Soviet Authors:
In 1925 Mayakovsky also made one of his few forays into the sphere of utopian science fiction with his poem Letaiushchi Proletarii (&#34;The Flying Proletarian&#34;). As described by Victor Tarras in his biography of Mayakovsky, The Flying Proletarian was:
...set in the year 2125 and features a giant air battle, with death rays and such, between the Soviet proletarian and the American bourgeois air forces.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation. Here&#39;s an example of a blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia
 Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels.</description>

      <description>Late August, given heavy rain and sun
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet
Like thickened wine: summer&#39;s blood was in it
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots</description>

      <description>What is Discardia?
 Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas you no longer need. It&#39;s about letting go, abdicating from obligation and guilt, being true to the self you are now. Discardia is the time to get rid of things that no longer add value to your life, shed bad habits, let go of emotional baggage and generally lighten your load. - Dinah Sanders  Discardia was the theme of today&#39;s a2b3 Thursday lunch.</description>

The great pop vs. soda controversy is a project that Alan McConchie did to survey regional use of generic names for soft drinks. You&#39;ll see here clearly that Michigan is a &#34;pop&#34; state; the sharp Wisconsin vs. Upper Peninsula divide of soda vs. pop is notable. You have to do pretty far south into Indiana to see &#34;</description>

      <description>Every year around this time (June 17) the juneberry trees in the streets of Ann Arbor are ripe. Juneberries - variously shadbush, shadberry, or serviceberry, depending on where you&#39;re from - are iron ore pellet sized, dark purple when ripe, slightly sweet with soft seeds inside that are vaguely almondy. They are not delicious, not in the sense that strawberries are delicious, but they are good to grab a handful of and snack on as you&#39;re walking down the street.</description>

      <description>I went strawberry picking with the boys on Father&#39;s Day at Rowe&#39;s Produce Farm in Rawsonville, about a mile s. of the Rawsonville Road exit between Ypsilanti and Belleville. It was a hot day with a bright sun, the berries were ripe but not overripe, and we picked an 8 qt tray in no time at all.
Afterwards I washed and picked over the berries (a 3 y/o, no matter how enthusiastic, is not a perfect judge of ripeness or berry quality).</description>

Every day people would zoom to and from the hospital, and every day the AAPD would stop some fraction of them to give them tickets. I was glad for it too - to cross Depot when cars are barreling along at 45 in a 30 zone was not fun.</description>

A similar set of data (not precisely the same, but overlapping) is kept by the National Weather Service, as part of their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. This has a whole set of comprehensive rainfall measures, which are as useful in drought condition monitoring as they are in flood monitoring.</description>

Now you can report power outages on line using a mobile device.
Just go to mobile.dteenergy.com with your web-based cell phone or PDA. In moments you can report an outage or get a repair estimate on a previously reported outage.

This is reporting only, not mapping, and the mobile interface has the most pessimistic assumptions about mobile phone capacity.</description>

In the Midwest, power coordination between utilities is done through the Midwest ISO, an organization that is responsible for orderly transfer of capacity between generators and transmission lines and for helping plan and predict seasonal and outage-related load changes that require competitors to work together.</description>

The other popular seasonal page is my annual Michigan morel map, which I pull an excerpt from the morel progression sightings map and highlight the appearance of these tasty mushrooms in the Michigan woods.</description>

The intent of the event, which has been held in several cities throughout the country, is to start the weekend with no formal business plans and emerge a few days later with a couple of real companies.</description>

      <description>GasBuddy has built a very nice infrastructure for tracking gas prices across the county. If you sign up, you can update the site with current observations of pricing; if you don&#39;t sign up, you can still view individual and aggregated data.

The map above is not quite enough to decide where to stop, except to note that if you happen to be heading south you should probably fill up in Ohio, not Michigan (tax differences account for the price difference).</description>

      <description>Google&#39;s Street View has come to Ann Arbor. From the looks of it, the photos were taken last fall; gas was $2.899 a gallon. The photo of my street showed Mario and Luigi&#39;s toys out in the front, and a neighbor across the street was working on his lawn.

Notable from the map above is the scrupulous adherence to the freeway boundaries of Ann Arbor in the mapping effort.</description>

      <description>The Detroit News has some reporting on the DTE power outages across the Detroit metro region.

The company serves Metro Detroit, home to about 136,000 of the homes and businesses still without power. More than two-thirds of those -- 95,000 -- are in Oakland County, where frustrations are running high as schools and businesses remained closed and families flocked to hotels for temporary shelter. Since Sunday night, an estimated 600,000 people in Michigan have been affected by the outages.</description>

      <description>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form. Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.
The single best blog on the topic is Dave&#39;s Landslide Blog, from Dave Petley, who is the Wilson Professor at Durham University, UK. He&#39;s doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won&#39;t even try to be up to date with that.</description>

      <description>In the &#34;try this next year&#34; category, here are some designs for a planter for tomatoes where you put the tomato seedlings in a bucket and then hang the bucket upside down. Two advantages are obvious: one, that if there&#39;s frost, you can move the bucket out of the way, and two, you can grow in places where you don&#39;t have soil.
Three, I guess, is that you can plant something nice in the top of the pot and have it do double duty.</description>

      <description>Frost warnings for Ann Arbor for tonight; that&#39;s kind of late.
In the spirit of gardeners everywhere, here&#39;s some collected recommendations for dealing with frost damage in your garden.
From Zimbabwe and Farm Radio International:
 Protect Tomatoes from Frost By Livai Matarirano, Zimbabawe
You can grow tomatoes even in cold weather. A farmer in Zimbabwe, Mr. Francis Handwa, uses cooking oil or milk bottles filled with water to keep tomato plants warm.</description>

      <description>every once in a while you have to look at the net to see what other people say that you are. so here&#39;s that search for a2b3.
First, all the things that don&#39;t relate to the lunch meeting:
A2B3 is a rare genotype resulting from the inheritance of both A and B genes on one chromosome.
The p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein inhibits a2b3 integrin-mediated cell spreading on vitronectin by blocking PKC-dependent localization of a2b3 to focal contacts</description>

Hurricane Katrina downsized his domain to nothing. Today, his new castle is about one-seventh the size of his old one, measuring 450 square feet. But surveying the familiar view from the dollhouse porch of his &amp;ldquo;Mississippi cottage,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Voorhies is one of many storm survivors who have reassessed their coastal existence.</description>

      <description>Reification is an ontological imperative.
I think that this might be some deep statement about the semantic web, but it&#39;s so deep that I really don&#39;t understand it.
Reification in this sense appears to have something to do with taking abstract concepts and making them concrete, turning ad hoc heuristics into code, writing down a set of things into a list so that it can be machine processed and sorted, and otherwise taking thoughts and ideas and turning them into bits.</description>

I don&#39;t remember why I found it - I&#39;m offline right now.
The tool of choice for going offline is a little Mac application
called Freedom, which disables your Internet access for a specified
period of time so that you can get things done. Written by Fred Stutzman at UNC.
 Freedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only circumvention of the Freedom time limit you specify.</description>

      <description>How do you become an expert in a field? By writing about that field, repeatedly, until you have mastered it to the level which people find you easily and draw on your expertise.
A big part of being able to write about something twice a day is to have a ready collection of other people to call on for ideas or to ask for details or referrals. By being ready to tap into other people&amp;rsquo;s expertise, you figure out what you need to know fast.</description>

      <description>You can be an expert with the blogger&#39;s secret:
1. Pick a topic.
2. Write about it twice a day.
3. At the end of six months, you will be an expert.
Note well: choose carefully what you want to be an expert about! It&#39;s mighty hard to be an expert about more than one thing this way, just because it consumes so much time.</description>

One of the regular top hits on my blog is the post I did about how to report a noise complaint in Ann Arbor. Recently, the local college has been doing a little bit of construction around their playing field, and some of the neighbors have complained about the sound.
If you were going to spend too much money to monitor noise, you&#39;d put together some kind of infrastructure with data loggers at various points around the area, all of which sent their readings (and perhaps audio capture) back to a central system for analysis and reporting and alerting.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ll link to election results when they go online here. The Washtenaw County site has the official results. The Ann Arbor News has coverage on the blog, but, true to form, they don&#39;t link to the official results site in their coverage.
Early returns (63% counted at 9:30pm) have both Ann Arbor millage proposals passing 3-1, and incumbent school board member Helen Gates-Bryant leading 2-1. Voter turnout looks like it&#39;s going to be less than 10% county wide.</description>

      <description>Some notes on something that doesn&#39;t exist yet, but should.
Imagine a service that has URLs like
http://wheresmybus.org/route/5/inbound/packard+granger/3
http://wheresmybus.org/route/any/inbound/packard+state/0
http://wheresmybus.org/route/any/any/stone-school+eisenhower/4
and which has a very simple output of the times you need to leave to catch the next bus
8:04
8:22
based on the following:
real time bus location information (via mobile ridetrak), for buses already en route, and then estimated times for scheduled buses not yet visible. This is scrapable from existing services.</description>

      <description>reposted from the Columbia Missourian
COLUMBIA — Marie V. Scholes, a Columbia resident for 60 years, loved reading and conversation about politics and history.
“She seemed to know everything and was extremely intelligent,” said her niece, Diane Lucas. “You could have a good conversation on anything with her even if you didn’t agree. We agreed to disagree on politics.”
When Mrs. Scholes wasn’t talking about history and politics, she was reading about it.</description>

      <description>Garlic Mustard in Michigan, a report and information from Michigan State University:  Garlic mustard is an exotic invasive plant from Europe that invades woodland habitats in North America and impacts forest biodiversity. In some woodlands, dense stands of garlic mustard in the spring threaten showy spring blooming ephemerals like spring beauty, trilliums and trout lilies. Other research points toward potentially negative impacts on timber species and forest health. Many land managers consider it to be one of the most potentially harmful and difficult to control invasive plants in the region.</description>

      <description>An important piece of having coffee in the morning is making it part of a routine. If you&#39;re predictable in your habits, you start to see the same people in the same space at the same time, and you get to be something of a regular.
If you&#39;re careful, and switch your morning allegiances from time to time but still visit the old haunts often enough, you can be what passes for a regular long after you stopped coming every day.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m looking for a weather forecast in RSS which packs as much information into the subject line as possible.
By point of comparison, here are a few examples of things that could be better. The weather underground&#39;s feed looks like this: Current Conditions - 49.8F / 9.9C | Partly Cloudy - 6:50 AM EDT Apr. 23 Today as of Apr. 23 3:45 AM EDT which is OK for current information (albeit wordy) but useless for the forecast.</description>

Much better to have dte report the table of areas with power outages directly as a csv than to have to reconstruct it from pixel color values on a map, but we cope with the civic infrastructure we have, not the civic infrastructure we want.</description>

      <description>I need to be mindful of what I am doing all the time, so that things get done and I don&amp;rsquo;t just wander off into cyberspace. (Cyberspace, remember that, data gloves and VRML and the metaverse and all that? Yeah. There.)  There are two fundamental issues in time tracking for me: accurately logging the start and stop of each task, and determining which bucket of pre-assigned tasks it goes into (or determining that a new bucket needs to be allocated to describe that task).</description>

      <description>I wrote a few years back about a mini-kanban that John Hritz had put together to remember to refill washer fluid. There are a lot of colorful sticky notes around my workplace these days, so I thought I&#39;d read up on how kanban-inspired systems are being used for process management in the software development and other non-manufacturing worlds.  Some inspiring examples (with post-its to illustrate):  Corey Ladas on Kanban systems for software engineering:  A perfect state of flow may be very difficult, or at least uneconomical, to achieve in a robust product development process.</description>

      <description>The Detroit area SMART bus system now has routing and schedule information in Google Transit. It gives bus numbers and times for rides across the metro Detroit area, and plans the next available trips for you.  With all of this data it now looks almost possible to schedule and plan transportation from Ann Arbor to large parts of metro Detroit on public transportation. Mind you it&amp;rsquo;s a little roundabout, but you have two choices:  - take Amtrak Ann Arbor - Detroit - Royal Oak - Pontiac, 3 trips/day - take the Michigan Flyer bus to Metro Airport, switch to a SMART bus, and connect to routes from there - allow plenty of time for transfers and to find your stops.</description>

There&#39;s more information and discussion of this on: - Arbor Update - Get Downtown - Ann Arbor News - Ann Arbor Is Overrated links to follow when they all get around to writing about it  The short summary, I think, is that the bus system is shifting its service to improve route frequency to the west side of town, cutting service on routes that have low ridership, and shaving a trip here and there.</description>

      <description>My cousin Zorba wrote a eulogy for my great uncle Auch, who died last week at the age of 96. The whole thing is a bit too much to share right now, but there was one paragraph that really spoke to me about the sort of family I come from (and perhaps some insight into who I am)  In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us.</description>

      <description>If you could pay attention to just one thing over the next 15 minutes, what would it be?  The list of categories of potential things to be alert to is too long, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to sort through them to find the right type of thing. Don&amp;rsquo;t start by reviewing the list, because the list is too long to review without making that the one solitary task.</description>

      <description>Winter &amp;nbsp;
 CLOUDED with snow  The cold winds blow, And shrill on leafless bough The robin with its burning breast  Alone sings now. &amp;nbsp;
 The rayless sun,  Day&#39;s journey done, Sheds its last ebbing light On fields in leagues of beauty spread  Unearthly white. &amp;nbsp;
 Thick draws the dark,  And spark by spark, The frost-fires kindle, and soon Over that sea of frozen foam  Floats the white moon.</description>

      <description>As GigaOM notes in Yahoo Please Put Up A Fight
Yahoo has a staggering 500 million users. However, it does a rather poor job of monetization. The vision that Yang shared at CES last week (“At Yahoo we want to be the most essential starting point for your life”) can come true if the key activities that we perform online are channeled through its My Yahoo service. And on the financial side, each of those activities needs to be backed up by a monetization model that takes full advantage of the traffic that Yahoo consistently manages to generate and preserve.</description>

      <description>If your neighbor erects a giant sign on their lawn, or on the side of their house, what is your recourse?  UPDATE: In Ann Arbor the simple and direct way to deal with this is to call the city&amp;rsquo;s Community Standards department at 734-994-1613. A neighbor who has been through this before says that they deal with sign problems promptly.  The appropriate part of the city code reads as follows.</description>

 There were 12 for lunch for the first event, and the restaurant obliged with a soup and sandwich for $5 special.</description>

      <description>Bob, Kim, Margaret and I went out for lunch at Maru today. Bob and Margaret had the bi bim bop, and Kim had a bento with spicy chicken (and a side of macaroni). I had the galbi tang, a big bowl of steaming delicious beef short rib soup for $9.  We talked about a bunch of things, and it was pleasant.  Maru is about $1 or $2 per dish more than Seoul Korner was, and for that extra you get table service, somewhat bigger portions, more banchan (we had 4 for 4 people), and a broader menu.</description>

      <description>This is a copy of http://www.a2gov.org/government/publicservices/fieldoperations/Pages/SnowRemoval.aspx as of December 2007, with markup and annotations noted.  The City of Ann Arbor performs a variety of street maintenance depending upon the amount of snow that falls. Generally, the categories are described as &amp;ldquo;light snow,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;snow emergency.&amp;rdquo; In addition, the city is dependent upon its citizens for sidewalk snow removal.  For up to date snow information please watch Cable Television Network (CTN) Channel 16.</description>

Don&#39;t even apply if you want to have a private office with a door; even the VPs have double offices. 2. If you want to build the next great new Web 2.0 thing, go build it, you don&#39;t need Google for that. 3. If you want to telecommute then Google is not your place.</description>

 January - keep your new years resolution; how to drive in ice and snow February - heart month; seasonal affective disorder, effect on appetite March - March Madness basketball; cosmetic surgery for bikini season April - spring cleaning, income taxes May - summer vacations, Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, the problem that Mom faces June - Christmas pitches, stay safe on vacation July - Independence (the word), travel safely with kids August - hot summer weather impact on business, back to school September - Labor Day, weddings, census October - lawn and garden cleanup, consumer information month November - winterize car and home, heating costs December - unusual gifts, gift certificates, save money on taxes  The instructive effort would be to use Google Trends to quantify the peakiness of each of these in time and space, and synchronize your annual seasonal efforts early enough to capture interest and to be properly indexed when time comes for people to search.</description>

      <description>I did the Google search for &#34;quantitative measures of usability&#34;, to see if that line of thinking would get me something useful. Here&#39;s some explorations around those search results, and some reflections on that line of reasoning.  CHI: single usability metric  There is a site &#34;measuring usability&#34; which unsurprisingly ranked high on the list. It introduces the novel concept of a &#34;single measure of usability&#34;, which looks like the sum of a bunch of individual metrics all mushed together into a single number.</description>

      <description>I used to send a lot more postcards, back in the day when I was on airplanes all the time.
 Jason Womack sends this out in his newsletter recently, about holiday cards and card writing in general:  Chances are however you celebrate the closing of one year and the opening of another, you will connect with more people in your network during the holiday season. People wonder how I have time for it all.</description>

      <description>from UPI in their &#34;quirks&#34; section:  ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Officials in Ann Arbor, Mich., are working on a plan to allow residents of the college town to set up their own chicken coops. City Councilman Stephen Kunselman told his colleagues during the weekend there is support among residents who like the idea of having access to &#34;farm fresh&#34; eggs, which some foodies consider to be tastier and healthier than the store-bought variety.</description>

      <description>I was at the NSFNET 20th reunion last week. Here&#39;s some notes after the fact.  I took good notes on URLs mentioned on delicious - look at http://del.icio.us/vielmetti/nsfnet to get the running commentary as I was trying to do it.  History is written by the winners, and thus the NSFNET history was written by the winners - the winners of the 1987 contract to manage it (Merit, MCI and IBM), and those who personally or corporately won out when the backbone was transformed from a research and educational network into a commercial one.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had good experiences with sharing of surplus resources at a neighborhood level. The folks on my block regularly borrow ladders, save up canning jars, pick each others surplus tomatoes, take care of cats etc as needed. Sometimes token amounts of cash change hands - mostly to pay kids - but often not.
 I look at the kinds of businesses and business plans aimed at monetizing neighborliness with a bit of skepticism.</description>

      <description>repeated from a recipe blog I used to keep, from 2001.
A very simple orzo salad.
 One pound orzo. 1 pint-size tub green olives 1 pint-size tub feta cheese 2 bunches parsley  Cook the orzo and rinse with cold water to remove the starch and stop it from cooking. Pit the olives, reserving the juice they came in. (It is key to have good olives for this recipe - we get good ones at Whole Foods or (better) the food coop, &amp;quot;french provencal with herbs&amp;quot;.</description>
