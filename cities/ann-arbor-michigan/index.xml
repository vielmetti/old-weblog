      <description>&lt;p&gt;A severe storm dumped a bunch of water on Ann Arbor on Sunday, June 14, 2015. Here are reports of flood locations as monitored on Twitter. All times Eastern.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily telegraph: A new routine with the Argus Farm Stop and the Ann Arbor Y</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2015/2015-04-13-daily-telegraph-a-new-routine-with-the-argus-farm-stop-and-the-ann-arbor-y/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was spring break, so my routines were completely upended. The boys didn&#39;t have school and so I didn&#39;t actually have to be anywhere in the morning. Yet I was up and out of bed and awake by 7:00 a.m. and the weather was nice. Perfect weather to try out a new spring routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first piece of the new routine is getting to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.annarborymca.org/&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor YMCA&lt;/a&gt;. If the weather is nice and I don&#39;t have anything else going on, it&#39;s a nice bike ride; if I&#39;m making a car trip into town for school, it&#39;s close enough to be a good next stop. The only slight problem with the Y during the day is parking, not that I&#39;d spend money on parking, but that everyone knows to park on West Washington St. There&#39;s nothing quite like a sauna in the morning to get you going, and there&#39;s a lovely little library by the pool with a very fast wifi and good power outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second piece of the new routine is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.argusfarmstop.com/&#34;&gt;Argus Farm Stop&lt;/a&gt;. I had been in here when it first opened, but now the routine has settled down a bit, and after the 8:00 a.m - 9:00 a.m. coffee rush it&#39;s a pretty reasonable spot to sit and type. There&#39;s delicious day-old bread to be had at reasonable prices and they will lop off an end for you to chew on while you drink your coffee. As a bonus the parking on Second St usually has a free space on one side or another at 8:00 a.m. so I can walk to the Y, do my thing, walk back, sit for a bit and type some more, and be good to go by 10:00 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation at the Farm Stop is sparkling - talked to a fellow named Granger who&#39;s moving here from Colorado about food, where to get a good bi bim bap, and his plans with his friends to open up a glass shop in town. [Kathy Sample] was behind the counter sorting out the morning flow and talking about the farmers bringing in their produce and their meats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between those two changes I now can pretty much count on being bathed, fed, watered, and have a little bit of shopping done by 10:00 a.m. If the weather is nice, I get a bike ride in to start the day, and I haven&#39;t spent any pennies on parking, and it also works to take the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s the most expensive parking space in Ann Arbor?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2015/2015-03-24-whats-the-most-expensive-parking-space-in-ann-arbor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 08:56:56 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2015/2015-03-24-whats-the-most-expensive-parking-space-in-ann-arbor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the a2civictech meetup. We met at Zingerman&#39;s Next Door, there were 9 people who showed up, some familiar faces and some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nominal topic of the discussion was data quality, understanding how various data sets that come from civic sources have noise in them and looking at ways to deal with that. The best story was that of a well map that showed a hill in the middle of a lake, because the underlying data set had two wells with the same name and the person who built the map picked the wrong data to map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always with these discussions the question turned to what data there might be available to look at, and how to get it. That led us to questions of what other people were doing with municipal data in other cities, and to this New York City parking ticket analysis: &lt;a href=&#34;http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/87573867759/success-how-nyc-open-data-and-reddit-saved-new&#34;&gt;Success: How NYC Open Data and Reddit Saved New Yorkers Over $55,000 a Year&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that there was a parking space in New York that looked like it was a legal spot, but turned out to be frequently ticketed because it was near a fire hydrant. After some analysis and publicity by Ben Wellington of I Quant NY, the NYC DOT repainted the stripes on the street to clearly mark this spot as a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question becomes, how would you repeat this analysis for Ann Arbor, and what would you look for? Where are there locations that frequently generate tickets, what do they look like on a map, and how much ticket revenue comes per space?  And in the public interest, are there any spots that generate disproportionate ticket frequencies that should be looked at carefully to improve signage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like a project. In New York there&#39;s a data catalog that includes this data set and many others; no such data has been released in Ann Arbor. So the first step is understanding what the process is for getting a year or two of ticket data to start analyzing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_wellington_how_we_found_the_worst_place_to_park_in_new_york_city_using_big_data?language=en&#34;&gt;TED Talk by Ben Wellington&lt;/a&gt; on &#34;How we found the worst place to park in New York City -- using big data&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite weather forecasts comes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forecast.io&#34;&gt;forecast.io&lt;/a&gt;. This screen shows the ensemble set of forecasts they have for temperature for tomorrow (February 20, 2015), highlighting the 8:00 a.m. reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7508be5970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7508be5970b img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-02-20 at 12.18.04 AM&#34; title=&#34;Screen Shot 2015-02-20 at 12.18.04 AM&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7508be5970b-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is &lt;a href=&#34;http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/model/&#34;&gt;RAP&lt;/a&gt; from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Looking at their set of pages they have a nice cold temperature forecast map. Brrr! You have to head pretty far to escape the frigid air, it looks like the vector towards warmth is to the southwest&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is considering hiring &#34;downtown ambassadors&#34; to patrol city streets, help out visitors, and keep the downtown neat and clean and welcoming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint to this corporatized welcoming function, I give you the Psychedelic Rangers, a project of the Rainbow People&#39;s Party (1972) which provided security to concerts and generally kept the peace without bringing in the law.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obituary: John Gall, 1925-2014</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2014/2014-12-15-john-gall-obituary/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gall, John C. 9/18/1925 - 12/15/2014 Walker, MN John C. Gall, Jr.,
beloved husband, father, pediatrician, scholar and author, passed
away with his wife by his side Dec. 15, 2014, in Walker, MN, from
natural causes. He was 89. John was born on September 18, 1925 in
Washington, D.C. and grew up near Upperville, VA. In 1945 he was
drafted into the Army Air Corps and sent to Germany, where he served
as a medic in the Allied army of occupation. During his tour of
duty he attended the Nuremberg trials, which kindled in him a
lifelong passion to heal the afflicted and promote justice. Upon
returning home he furthered his education, graduating from Yale and
George Washington University Medical School. He was a postdoctorate
fellow at the Mayo Clinic, where he was dubbed &amp;ldquo;the best pediatric
diagnostician [they had] ever seen!&amp;rdquo; In addition he earned a
certification in Human Genetics and completed 7 years of therapy
training. Dr. Gall began his medical career as a researcher at the
University of Virginia, followed by a 3-year stint at the Geisinger
Clinic in Danville, PA. He next went into private practice in Miles
City, MT, but was soon invited to teach at the University of Michigan
Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. There he also served as head of
the Plymouth State Home, where he did research partially funded by
the Kennedy family foundation, and named and described several
syndromes of the developmentally disabled . In addition he established
a long-running private pediatric practice of 38 years. During this
period he developed a special appreciation for, and an enduring
interest in, the importance of nonverbal communication between very
young children and their parents. This led him to expand his practice
to include support and education classes, in which he was aided by
his late wife, Beth, and then by his wife Carol. Their observations
and anecdotes are included in Elegant Parenting, written with wife,
Beth; in Dancing with Elves written by John, and with wife Carol
he wrote Hit by a Low-Flying Goose. John&amp;rsquo;s best known book is System
Antics, later published under the title The Systems Bible, a humorous
but insightful study of the problems and pitfalls that afflict every
type of system that human beings create-whether mechanical, economic,
corporate, aeronautical, legal, linguistic, religious, medical or
electronic. It was first published in 1976 by the New York
Times/Quadrangle Press and has been translated (officially or
unofficially) into at least 14 languages. He lectured widely
throughout the United States and was interviewed by the Voice of
America on nuclear proliferation issues after its publication. John
and Carol were both invited to speak in London in 2012 to a group
of CEOs and other executives from around the world and John was
introduced as &amp;ldquo;The Grandfather of Systems Theory.&amp;rdquo; He retired to
Walker, MN, in 2001 in search of privacy and uninterrupted time,
which he used to write seven other books, including a novel, First
Queen, plus books and video books on parenting and the art of
pediatric practice. He was very proud that the great Swiss psychiatrist,
Alice Miller, who introduced the world to the subject of child
sexual abuse, endorsed his work before she died. His work has also
been endorsed by others too numerous to name, but including such
luminaries as the head of the Dept. of Psychology at Cambridge,
University, who forwarded his material to several British social
service agencies. In the late 1990s John helped to write the National
Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Exam in Washington D.C several years
running. More recently he was invited to Washington D.C. by a
government psychiatrist and consulted with this man on the development
of psychological profiles of moles (double agents). He also spoke
at a symposium at Princeton University entitled &amp;ldquo;Children under the
Shadow of War.&amp;rdquo; The group included scholars from around the world,
and filmmakers who had photographed kidnapped children who had been
conscripted into war and forced to commit atrocities. It was John&amp;rsquo;s
job to deliver the final speech, summarizing and tying together all
of the presentations. This was the only lecture open to the public.
John gave a moving presentation that left not a dry eye in the
audience. In the final months of his life, John continued to think
and write actively on a wide range of subjects. Most recently he
completed a 4th edition of Systemantics and contributed, with other
international scholars, to a book on Panarchy, due to be published
in 2015. John was preceded in death by his first wife, Beth, and
three step-grandsons, Michael Nelson, and Franklin and Alexander
Sawvel. His is survived by his wife, Carol, brothers Dr. Joseph
Gall (Diane Dwyer) and Howard, sons Duane (Valerie) and David
(Suzette), step-sons Steven (Sarah) and Terrell (Eleanor) Nelson,
and grandchildren Izzie, Nathan, Sebastian, and Simone, plus
step-grandchildren Anthony, Cody, Alaya, Nicole, and Branden Nelson.
A private family ceremony will be held in the Episcopal Church in
Upperville, VA, in the late spring.  -&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dug Song&#39;s letter to the Ann Arbor News endorsing Kirk Westphal, annotated</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/2013-10-27-dug-songs-letter-to-the-ann-arbor-news-annotated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dug Song wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/opinion/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2013/10/letter_kirk_westphal_will_help.html&#34;&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; of the Ann Arbor News which was published on Sunday, 27 October 2013. It is annotated here with the hyperlinks to a variety of sources for further reading. The letter includes a political endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While I deeply appreciate city council&#39;s dedication to a balanced budget and basic services, we cannot simply save our way to success. &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Pfizer&#34;&gt;Post-Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;, Ann Arbor must increase its tax base by supporting a strong and diversified economy of high-growth, high tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2007, Pfizer announced that the Ann Arbor facilities -- primarily a large campus on Plymouth Road -- would be closing by the end of 2008. The University of Michigan purchased the Pfizer campus, turning it into the North Campus Research Complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&#34;&gt;Software is eating the world&lt;/a&gt;, and franchises from Borders to Blockbuster have been obsoleted by innovative companies advancing new technologies we all quickly take for granted. Such companies have significant impact not just globally, but also drive the growth of the communities that host them. Pick up a copy of &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hmhbooks.com/newgeographyofjobs/&#34;&gt;The New Geography of Jobs&lt;/a&gt;&#34; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://literatibookstore.com/&#34;&gt;Literati Bookstore&lt;/a&gt; to understand the multiplier effect high tech jobs have on local business, and why place matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Why &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&#34;&gt;Software is eating the world&lt;/a&gt;&#34; is a 2011 essay by Marc Andreessen in the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borders was an Ann Arbor based bookstore that grew from a single store into a worldwide bookselling leader. It closed its doors in 2011 after 40 years in business. This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/12/first.borders.bookstore.closing/index.html&#34;&gt;CNN story&lt;/a&gt; gives a good history of its rise and fall. &lt;a href=&#34;http://literatibookstore.com/&#34;&gt;Literati Bookstore&lt;/a&gt; is an independent bookstore that opened in Ann Arbor in 2013, inheriting several former Borders employees and a number of its bookshelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As CEO of a fast-growing high tech company, and mentor and advisor to many other innovative, venture-backed startups here, I can personally testify to the challenges of building a company downtown. All of my prior companies have been split between Ann Arbor and elsewhere, with most of their economic impact (hundreds of millions of dollars in jobs, services, investment, and spin-offs) outside of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Dug&#39;s prior companies was &lt;a href=&#34;http://arbornetworks.com&#34;&gt;Arbor Networks&lt;/a&gt;, which split itself between Ann Arbor and the Boston area. Arbor was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arbornetworks.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2010-press-releases/1994-tektronix-communications-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbor-networks&#34;&gt;acquired in 2010&lt;/a&gt; by Tektronix Communications, a division of Danaher. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to see us reverse that trend. We have had far too many world-changing technology companies start in Ann Arbor, but leave to grow their people and fortunes elsewhere. It&#39;s often for the most mundane of reasons that 20- and 30-somethings here understand all too well.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;We need a city council that demonstrates fiscal responsibility, open governance, and good kindergarten skills, but also promotes a vision of positive growth for our community. In today&#39;s economy, if we aren&#39;t busy growing, we&#39;re just slowly dying, and I&#39;ve been terrified by the Tea Party-like obstructionism I&#39;ve seen from council members on issues of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &#34;Tea Party&#34; label has been applied to opponents on City Council before, most notably via the anonymous weblog &#34;Middle of the Left&#34; which uses the term &lt;a href=&#34;http://middleoftheleft.com/wake-up-ann-arbor-the-teapublicans-are-taking-over-your-city-council/&#34;&gt;Teapublicans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this reason, I support Kirk Westphal, Democratic candidate in Ward 2 for Ann Arbor city council. His vision of a vital, walkable downtown supporting diversity, density, and dynamism is a recipe for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/&#34;&gt;placemaking&lt;/a&gt;, and a natural engine for economic growth. We need downtown Ann Arbor to be a real place again and not just a hollowed-out franchise of Traverse City minus the bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference to &#34;franchise of Traverse City&#34; alludes to several TC based businesses that have set up shop in Ann Arbor, including Cherry Republic and the restaurants Blue Tractor and Jolly Pumpkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A vote for Kirk is a vote for progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election day is Tuesday, November 5, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Affinia Group to move headquarters from Ann Arbor, MI to Gastonia, NC; 50 jobs at stake</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/2013-10-15-affinia-group-to-move-headquarters-from-ann-arbor-mi-to-gastonia-nc-50-jobs-at-stake/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/2013-10-15-affinia-group-to-move-headquarters-from-ann-arbor-mi-to-gastonia-nc-50-jobs-at-stake/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/10/15/4390165/ann-arbor-mich-company-to-relocate.html&#34;&gt;Charlotte Observer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Affinia Group Inc., a firm that designs, manufactures, distributes and markets industrial grade products and services, will relocate its Ann Arbor, Mich., headquarters to Gastonia, home of its Global Filtration group.
  The transition to the new corporate headquarters will occur in phases during 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia gives a little background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Affinia Group, a motor industry company, was formed in 2004 and specializes in the design, manufacture and replacement of parts for and on and off-road vehicles. Specifically filtration and chassis components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gastongazette.com/spotlight/affinia-group-moving-headquarters-to-gastonia-1.218940&#34;&gt;Gaston Gazette&lt;/a&gt; has additional details -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Affinia has approximately 50 jobs at its current headquarters, but that doesn’t mean all those jobs will relocate here. “We’re still putting together the transition plan,” said Keith Wilson, president of WIX Global Filtration. “It’s more of a consolidation than it is a big addition of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/outside_the_loop/2013/10/affinia-group-to-move-headquarters-to.html&#34;&gt;Charlotte Business Journal&lt;/a&gt; points to a new CFO at Affinia as an impetus for the move:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It all started in December, when Affinia spun off its brakes unit that makes Raybestos brand of automobile brakes. That unit, called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brake-parts-inc-is-back-199857601.html&#34;&gt;Brake Parts Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, was sold to members of Affinia’s brakes unit management team. The price of the deal for Brake Parts, which contributed one-third of Affinia’s sales in 2011, wasn’t disclosed. Then on Monday, Affinia announced it had hired a Charlotte executive, Steve Klueg, as its new chief financial officer. Klueg, CFO at ReCommunity Recycling in Charlotte, will stay in the Charlotte area after he replaces Thomas Madden at Affinia, Howat says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Madden, the former Affinia CFO, is retiring, notes &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aftermarketnews.com/Item/119412/affinia_group_cfo_tom_madden_announces_retirement.aspx&#34;&gt;Aftermarket News&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#34;Tom Madden has almost 40 years of financial leadership to our company, and his guidance has been an immeasurable ingredient in helping us achieve our status as a worldwide leader,&#34; said Terry McCormack, president and CEO of Affinia Group. &#34;In a continuing demonstration of the commitment he has shown throughout his career, Tom will work side by side with our incoming CFO Steve Klueg to seamlessly transfer financial leadership over the coming months.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affinia&#39;s Ann Arbor headquarters is located at 1101 Technology Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48108.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finn Brunton, U-M Assistant Professor of Information, will present &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/node/1280591&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The Accidental Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Brunton&amp;#39;s talk, with the alternative title &amp;quot;Researching criminals, otherkin, cipher anarchists, spammers and the online history that doesn&amp;#39;t want to be kept,&amp;quot; kicks off a new series of monthly events addressing emergent research. Light refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes to follow. There&amp;#39;s a hashtag, #MLibRes, on which a half dozen people are tracking. This is an impressionistic transcript, not a summary or tidy narrative, more notes drawn from what I remember from the time and some of my own thoughts mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preservation is constant toil, entropy requires no maintenance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links are not permanent, and the scholar who depends on them persisting risks losing their research materials. Finn gave out bits of a manifesto, one of which was &amp;quot;embrace wget&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of the Good Neighbor, a theory of library collection shelving from Aby Warberg. &lt;a href=&#34;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;amp;type=summary&amp;amp;url=/journals/common_knowledge/v018/18.1.steinberg.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;An essay of the same name by Michael Steinberg.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion of Rodona Garst, a notorious spammer, and the ephemeral collections of data about her operations collected under the name &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20040202002820/http://belps.freewebsites.com/index2.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Behind Enemy Lines. One such collection is on archive.org&lt;/a&gt; so it has some hope of permanence. (but if you really want a copy, make one now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Blue is an institutional repository run by the University of Michigan. One notable project archived there is the Michigan Terminal System, which has original distribution tapes saved into non-ephemeral bits. Finn has been collecting tarballs of references for the works he&amp;#39;s done, and one idea (new to him and recommended by the audience) was to put his tarballs in Deep Blue, with the right kind of dark-archive permanence that was suitable to the contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference to &amp;quot;shearing layers&amp;quot; from Stewart Brand&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;How buildings learn&amp;quot;. Different parts of the system change at different speeds. &lt;a href=&#34;http://quietbabylon.com/2011/shearing-layers-of-stuff-dematerialization-4/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;From Quiet Babylon, a discussion of shearing layers&lt;/a&gt; looks interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heresies expounded: &amp;quot;we should save everything&amp;quot;, primarily because the Internet is all significant but to different populations. The example given is the Enron corpus, which is also a very useful spam corpus; if you discarded the spam you&amp;#39;d have been left with something less useful. Saving everything is problematic to archivists who are used to assessing collections and picking the good parts and compiling a finding aid, rather than taking all of the unfiled materials and collecting them willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more, but this captures the flavor of the event well; there will be a recording released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future events are Fourth Mondays. Follow @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/UMLibRes&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;UMLibRes&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://summers-knoll.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Summers-Knoll School&lt;/a&gt; offers students rich academic experiences in an intimate and vibrant environment. Come meet the teachers, learn about our unique approach and tour our new building, located at 2203 Platt Road in Ann Arbor across from the entrance to County Farm Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complimentary childcare for ages 4 and up will be available at our current campus at 2015 Manchester Road from 12:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. &lt;a href=&#34;http://summers-knoll.org/about/directions&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Directions to 2015 Manchester Road&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;will take you near the base of the Ann Arbor water tower visible from Washtenaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To register, email Karen Bayoneto at kbayoneto@summers-knoll.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://summers-knoll.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;summers-knoll.org &lt;/a&gt; | 734. 971.7991&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://joannahastings.blogspot.com/2012/04/open-house-april-22nd.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;From Joanna&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Head of School Blog&amp;quot;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our new building, paint is going onto the walls. The reading nooks looking out onto the courtyard are warm with color. The sun comes in through the huge windows and skylights, and every way you look there are views to the trees outside. The flexible learning spaces - the common areas, breakout spaces, front porches for the classrooms, the open library space - are everything I hoped they would be. The music and drama studio, the science lab, the art room, the classrooms; they are all spacious, bright, gorgeous places. Soon they will be alive with children and the hum of projects and great ideas.&amp;#0160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: my son goes to Summers-Knoll School, and he&amp;#39;s looking forward to having more kids in his age range, so I&amp;#39;m particularly eager to recruit 7th and 8th graders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If you are interested in going to public meetings, you must be interested in advance</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/2011-05-24-a2dda-aacitycouncil-notice/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2011 23:52:43 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/2011-05-24-a2dda-aacitycouncil-notice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Open Meetings Act requires 18 hours advance notice of special meetings, and even less time (though I am not clear how much less time) for special meetings of committees. Thus, if you were not on a mailing list (with a relatively small number of people on the list), you did not receive notice directly of this meeting which is needed to resolve the &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2gov.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;City of Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2dda.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s mutual disagreements over the city budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow this primarily through the exhaustively detailed reporting of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://workantileexchange.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;current coworking group&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;strong&gt;Dave Askins&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchroncile.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;, the timely reporting of my former coworker &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Stanton&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/AnnArbor.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;AnnArbor.com&lt;/a&gt;, and the new news beat that my former coworker &lt;strong&gt;James Dickson&lt;/strong&gt; is carving out at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2journal.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and the editorial direction that home town friend &lt;strong&gt;John Hilton&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;directs at the monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborobserver.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Observer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, the autonomous collective of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnarbor.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Damn Arbor&lt;/a&gt; pitches in, with &lt;strong&gt;Ben Connor Barrie&lt;/strong&gt; most likely to be the townie and grad student voice of civic news gathering. That weblog is in the tradition of previous efforts, notably &lt;strong&gt;Rob Goodspeed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodspeedupdate.com/20050716/Cat-AnnArbor.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Goodspeed Update&lt;/a&gt;, the autonomous collective and voice of &lt;strong&gt;Julie Weatherbee&lt;/strong&gt; at&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://arborupdate.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Arbor Update&lt;/a&gt;, and a long-anonymous &lt;strong&gt;Julia Lipman&lt;/strong&gt; at&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborisoverrated.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor is Overrated&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all shorthand to say that I hope you are going to this meeting, if you care about it, and that if you care enough about it to want to know that it exists without me telling you about it you have to ask to be informed in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Huron River water level watching: USGS National Water Information System</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/2011-03-23-huron-river-waterwatch/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2011 13:41:35 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/2011-03-23-huron-river-waterwatch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a href=&#34;http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=04174500&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;level of the Huron River as it goes through Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;with the USGS National Water Information System. On March 23, the river is rising, but it&amp;#39;s also fluctuating in levels, enough that it&amp;#39;s difficult to determine whether current trends would lead you to believe that there is any risk of flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://137.227.241.67/nwisweb/data/img/USGS.04174500.02.00065..20110316.20110323..0..gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image from 137.227.241.67&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a71f0970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;image from 137.227.241.67&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you were to watch this closely, what would you watch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USGS will give you an alert if the level of the river is above or below a certain level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first derivative is the rate of change of the water level. You&amp;#39;d want to track that to note trends. If you measured the difference between adjacent water levels, you&amp;#39;d identify spikes, which have been associated with work on the dam in the past; those will give you a metric on the order of rate of change in inches per hour. If you did some smoothing, you&amp;#39;d find trending measured in feet per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second derivative is the rate of the rate of change of the water level; you&amp;#39;re looking for that to identify erratic behavior. As a rule of thumb a time series with large movements in both directions (up and down) over a short amount of time is a sign of river disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plausible approach would be to compute a smoothed curve, and then alert on deviations from the smoothed curve. You&amp;#39;d love to be able to tell the difference between sudden downpour, steady rain, flash flood, work on the dam, and dam failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strip chart to line up with this is rainfail (measured in convenient units) and precipitation forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forecast is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/new/index.php?m=real&amp;amp;r=mi&amp;amp;w=map&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;USGS Waterwatch for Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Hidden behind the projected water level is a rainfall forecast for the watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://water.weather.gov/resources/hydrographs/annm4_hg.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image from water.weather.gov&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a7eb8970b&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0147e36a7eb8970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;image from water.weather.gov&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide data, if you want to look for more, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/new/index.php?m=real&amp;amp;r=mi&amp;amp;w=map&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Waterwatch&lt;/a&gt;. The black dots are flooding, blue are near flood.&lt;/p&gt;
