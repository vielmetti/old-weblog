DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.
Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.
Busch&amp;#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms). With police blocking the entrance to that neighborhood, you had the feeling that the store was being exceptionally kind to its neighbors and that it was exceptionally lucky.</description>

      <description>From their email; their web site shows the July 20 date.
 We will open a day earlier on Tuesday July 19. The early berries are ready and the Jersey expected in August.
 The blueberry crop that I&amp;#39;m watching is the Upper Peninsula wild blueberries; the report from my source (i.e. my mom) is that they need rain.</description>
