      <description>On May 18, 1927, disgruntled school board member Andrew Kehoe bombed the Bath, Michigan school, killing 38 children and six adults.
There is a new book out on the disaster, entitled Bath Massacre: America&#39;s First School Bombing, from the University of Michigan Press, written by Arnie Bernstein.&amp;nbsp; The press kindly sent me a copy.&amp;nbsp; Bernstein has a historian&#39;s eye for small and significant period details of fascinating interest to anyone who thinks about what the 1920s were like in Michigan, which makes it easy to pick up anywhere and read some small detail that gives you a sense for the times.</description>
