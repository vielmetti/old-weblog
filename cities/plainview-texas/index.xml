      <description>If you have a kid who eats peanut butter, you&amp;#39;ve been listening to news of the peanut recalls.&amp;#0160; And when your eight year old furrows his brow when you go shopping together and is concerned about salmonella in his peanuts, you&amp;#39;re concerned too.
The latest bit of this story is the closing of the PCA plant in Plainview, TX.&amp;#0160; I was able to grab some old news stories about the opening of the plant, and to compare those with the stories that are running now.</description>
