      <description>Michigan Emergency Incidents is a news service that covers emergency dispatch around the state of Michigan. Members of a closed Facebook group post call-outs of emergency services operations, and there&amp;rsquo;s generally follow up from other members to note incidents in progress or news stories written from the scene.
 All information contained in MEI posts is to come from received radio transmissions heard directly from radios / scanners or via an online broadcast, verified reliable sources, or first hand knowledge (ie you are on scene).</description>
