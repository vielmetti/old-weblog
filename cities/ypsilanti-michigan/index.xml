      <title>I voted, summer 2015 edition</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-08-04-i-voted/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor is one of three peculiar communities in the state of Michigan
to have partisan City Council elections; the other two are Ypsilanti and
Ionia. This has in recent years meant that the races that decide the makeup
of City Council happen in the summer when students are gone and when
voter turnout is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did vote, and I do plan to go to at least one of the parties celebrating
victory or acknowledging defeat by the candidates who have the remaining
funds from their campaign to put out a nice spread for supporters, hangers-on,
or the perpetually politically curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of picking up result tapes from Ward Four precincts, I ended up
at Arbor Brewing Company which was Council Party HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Sabra Briere&lt;/span&gt; over Will Leaf, handily with 70%+ of the vote,
though only 6% of registered voters actually voted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Ward: We&amp;rsquo;ll wait until the fall for this as Jane Lumm (I) meets
Sally Hart Petersen (D) in November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Zachary Ackerman&lt;/span&gt; defeats Steve Kunselman by about 40 votes.
This was the surprise of the night. Ackerman&amp;rsquo;s entire margin of victory was
his strong showing in 3-3 (Burns Park) where he outpaced Kunselman 345-171.
Turnout was under 11%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Jack Eaton&lt;/span&gt; defeats Jamie Magiera with about 60% of the vote.
Jack held his party at Wolverine Brewing; Jamie was at ABC, looking subdued.
Turnout was about 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifth Ward: &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Chip Smith&lt;/span&gt; defeated Mike Anglin with about 55% of the vote.
Voter turnout in the mighty Fifth Ward was strong compared to the other wards,
with a mighty 14% of the electorate turning out to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 85%+ of Ann Arbor voters who didn&amp;rsquo;t know enough or didn&amp;rsquo;t bother
to turn out to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>restaurant inspections</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-restaurant-inspections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every month the Washtenaw County Health Department does a round
of &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;restaurant inspections&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Wayne Eaker&lt;/span&gt; built
an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zengenuity/food-inspections&#34;&gt;importer&lt;/a&gt; that
pulls in data from the site that hosts the official county inspections,
and is storing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zengenuity/food-inspections-data&#34;&gt;inspection data&lt;/a&gt;
on Github to make it easier for the next person who wants to build
a nice interface to all the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne was good enough to find a spot to host an interface to this data
that lets you browse through it; you can find it at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&#34;&gt;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are permalinks to each inspection so that you can link to them.
See e.g. recent inspections for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/2015-06-17-slurping-turtle&#34;&gt;Slurping Turtle&lt;/a&gt;, June 17, 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/2015-04-27-china-chef-restaurant&#34;&gt;China Chef&lt;/a&gt;, Ypsilanti, April 27, 2015&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for three examples of places where I want to see a clean inspection on a followup
visit before I go or go back to there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From various sources including email and twitter; this is surely incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight&#39;s Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled. Bryant Elementary now closed in Ann Arbor due to power outage-caused heating failure. Students that arrived at school sent back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor District Library: &#34;The power is out at Malletts Creek Branch, it is currently closed. All other @aadl locations will open at 10 AM. Stay tuned for updates!&#34;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ypsilanti Township offices are closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14-B District Court is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Michigan University: Rec/IM: Due to technical problems, the Jones Pool will be closed until further notice. We apologize for the inconvenience. (via @EMU_Swoop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelsea Police say power is still out and is expected to be out for &#34;the next several hours,&#34; as of 8:15 a.m. Chelsea schools have also been closed. (Heritage News) Chelsea Center for the Arts will be closed today, Monday, November 18, 2013 due to a citywide power outage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was in a motorcycle accident in Ypsilanti on Friday, August 9, 2013. Here&amp;#39;s her posting to Craigslist about it - there is a reward offered for identification of the driver that caused the crash. Contact her through this email address:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;ttrfq-3993561879@comm.craigslist.org&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;ttrfq-3993561879@comm.craigslist.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Forest Ave and N. Hamilton St, August 09, 2013. An early 1990&amp;#39;s, I believe a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corsica&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Chevrolet Corsica&lt;/a&gt;, tan/gold in color, made an illegal right turn from the far left lane in front of our motorcycle. The vehicle stopped briefly in the intersection after causing us to dump our bike, but quickly left after the Ypsi Fire Dept came on the scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the first two pedestrians who spoke with us witnessed the accident, and appeared to be taking pictures/video of the scene. A third pedestrian, wearing a pink t-shirt, helped get our bike off of us and handed me my partners glasses. I&amp;#39;m sure he also witnessed the incident, and saw the vehicle leave the scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, or anyone you&amp;#39;ve spoke to had told you about this accident, or have pics/video if the incident, please contact me through this post. It can be done anonymously, we are looking for the driver of the vehicle who left the scene. Also, I&amp;#39;d like to thank the pedestrians, Ypsi firefighters, the fine paramedics of HVA, and Officer Thompson of Ypsi PD for all your help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: W. Forest Ave at N. Hamilton St. Ypsi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#39;s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Ypsilanti, Michigan to adopt more stringent Open Meetings Act rules</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-11-10-ypsilanti-michigan-to-adopt-more-stringent-open-meetings-act-rules/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2009 00:03:20 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YPSILANTI - A very straightforward yet revolutionary approach to open meetings in Ypsilanti says that every subcommittee of City Council must abide by the Michigan Open Meetings Act - including providing advance notice of meetings - just in case enough council members show up to form a quorum.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ypsiciti.com/section/News/Ypsi+broadens+scope+of+Open+Meetings+Act-article-1325.html&#34;&gt;Ypsilanti Citizen story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OMA resolution, which was added to council’s agenda at 5 p.m. on
Oct. 20, was discussed in relation to the approval of the Ypsilanti
Downtown Development Authority bylaws - a separate agenda item at the
meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdock said the resolution is simply about “having meetings where decisions are made open to the public.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although
he had previous discussions with City Manager Ed Koryzno during
Council’s goal-setting sessions in January, Murdock moved forward with
the resolution Oct. 20, when the DDA violated the Open Meetings Act
earlier in the month by having a quorum, or more than seven members of
the board, participate at a planning committee meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href=&#34;http://advanceypsilanti.com/?p=655&#34;&gt;Advance Ypsilanti PAC&lt;/a&gt; notes that the resolution snuck in at the last possible minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadly, the process by which this open meetings resolution
was enacted is exactly the opposite of an open process. This is not
just ironic, but suspect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider that this resolution was sent to the city
clerk and posted to the council packets at 4:16 p.m. the day of the
city council meeting, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;less than 3 hours &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;before
council was to convene. AY PAC asks ‘why’? There was no emergency, no
timeline that needed to be met on this issue. There was no pressing
need that forced this to be addressed and resolved THAT NIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can inform AY PAC as to why this was so urgent that it
needed to be addressed in a timeline that included NO opportunity for
public comment and little reflection by council, we welcome the
information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back story is the Ypsi DDA meeting in October 2008 which was held in closed session, in evident violation of the Open Meetings Act.&amp;#0160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ypsinews.com/index.php/200810-ypsilanti-dda-violates-open-meetings-act-twice-in-one-meeting/comment-page-1/&#34;&gt;From YpsiNews (Steve Pierce) at the time:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(October 7, 2008) During a meeting of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ypsilantidda.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ypsilanti Downtown Development&lt;/a&gt;, the DDA board violated not one, but two sections of the Open Meetings Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Director of the Ypsilanti DDA, Brian Vosburg, called an
emergency closed session meeting to be held on Friday, October 3, 2008
at 12 noon. The purpose of the meeting was to meet with DDA attorney
Tammie Tischler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DDA Director said in the meeting notice the “Closed Session (is)
to consider material exempt from discussion or disclosure by state or
federal statute - (Open Meetings Act 15.268, Section 8(h))”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neither the DDA Director nor the DDA attorney would cite
which state or federal statute exempts the DDA from the Open Meetings
Act. Failing to publicly state the reason for a closed session is a
violation of the Open Meetings Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
