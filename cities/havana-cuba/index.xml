      <description>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day.
For my dad&#39;s old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again.</description>

      <description>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don&#39;t have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.
The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that.</description>
