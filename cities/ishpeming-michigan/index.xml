      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google search: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=black+river+falls+michigan+fire+map&#34;&gt;black river falls michigan fire map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter search: &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.twitter.com/search?q=black%20river%20falls&#34;&gt;black river falls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 21 May 2009 there is a fire burning near Ishpeming, MI called the Black River Falls fire.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not in a densely populated area, but several dozen structures have burned, and there&#39;s a lot of crews that have been brought in to help fight the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Sleeper Lake Fire burned near Newberry, MI there was a lot of news that came out piecemeal from media, residents, and bloggers in the area.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m hoping to collect some of that same level of detail here.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s always a big concern when forests burn, especially when they burn uncontrolled in land that doesn&#39;t have a lot of roads in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s some details I&#39;ve been able to figure out so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yooper Daily blog from Shawn and Brian Malone, commercial photographers, has a post titled simply &lt;a href=&#34;http://yooperdaily.blogspot.com/2009/05/wildfires-break-out-in-up.html&#34;&gt;Wildfires Break Out In UP.&lt;/a&gt; They have an approximate map of the Black River Falls fire which shows it deep in the woods of Ely Township. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my searches go to another fire called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3321&#34;&gt;Black River Falls fire, but in Jackson County Wisconsin;&lt;/a&gt; this historical marker describes a 1977 fire, the traces of which are almost gone by now with timber regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Remote Sensing Applications Center of the USDA Forest Service has a series of maps, including this &lt;a href=&#34;http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/activefiremaps.php?op=maps&amp;rCode=enm&#34;&gt;Northern Midwest fire map&lt;/a&gt; (Northern Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin).&amp;nbsp; The current one I&#39;m looking at shows the Pinery Fire near L&#39;Anse, MI, but nothing from the Black River Falls fire. The scale on this is fairly large, so it doesn&#39;t pin down the precise acreage, just the nearest town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img  src=&#34;file:///Users/emv/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/moz-screenshot-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;For a more detailed map you turn to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/dnr&#34;&gt;Michigan DNR&lt;/a&gt;, which is preparing maps for active fire fighting. This sample shows the extent of the fire as of last update, though it doesn&#39;t have a date on the map, the file date is 20090521 (may 21, 2009).&amp;nbsp; &lt;a style=&#34;display: inline;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img  class=&#34;at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b image-full &#34; alt=&#34;Picture 2&#34; title=&#34;Picture 2&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0115709d95c6970b-800wi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m stopping here because this is what I started looking for, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to stay tuned to whatever other news sources you have if you&amp;rsquo;re close to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On twitter I notice updates from &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/MDNR&#34;&gt;@MDNR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/wluctv6&#34;&gt;@wluctv6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/miningjournal&#34;&gt;@miningjournal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/nortman&#34;&gt;@nortman&lt;/a&gt; and expect to collect more.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s worth noting that the Mining Journal has extremely terse 60 character headlines on Twitter which means that typical keyword style searches don&#39;t find them very well, though once you do find their news stream the writing and reporting is first rate, and they have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/527617.html&#34;&gt;interviews of people at the Red Cross shelter at Westwood High School&lt;/a&gt; which is quite evidently information central for families affected by the blaze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISHPEMING - Sandwiches, coffee, donuts, cots to sleep on - the American Red Cross shelter, set up at the Westwood High School gym, was ready to fill the needs of residents evacuated due to the Black River Falls fire off Marquette County Road 581.

The thing the evacuees were wanting most, however, was news about the fire.

Of the 300 people who passed through the shelter Wednesday, the vast majority wanted news about their homes and neighbors, said Red Cross Executive Director Kayla West.

&#34;They wanted information more than anything,&#34; she said.

      <title>Obituary: Faye Amo (1954-2011), high school French teacher</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MARQUETTE – Faye M. Amo, age 57, of 425 West Ridge Street, Marquette,
entered eternal life Wednesday evening, July 13, 2011, at her home
in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula
Home Health and Hospice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born March 23, 1954 in Lima, Ohio, a daughter of Stephen J. and
Ethel (Salidas) Catel, Faye was raised in Ishpeming and graduated
from the Ishpeming High School as salutatorian of her class. From
her days in grade school, Faye held the desire to become a teacher.
She enrolled at Northern Michigan University, where she received
her baccalaureate degree summa cum laude (with highest honor) with
a double major in French and English. She continued at Northern,
obtaining a double masters degree in English and French in 1977 and
later studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris where she
earned highest honors in French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faye’s
lifelong dream of becoming a teacher began with her first teaching
assignment at the Ishpeming High School in 1977. In 1979, she started
teaching French at the Marquette Senior High School, a career that
would span 31 years. Teaching French was her passion in life and
she loved all her students and they loved her. Affectionately known
as Madame Amo, she was the consummate professional teacher, one who
truly cared about her students and was dedicated to their education
and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not enough that the
students learned the French language, she felt they needed to
experience what “French” meant. Heading the French Club at Marquette
Senior High School, Faye planned numerous trips for club members
to big city museums to view French art exhibits, eat at French
eateries, and learn about French culture. Over the years, several
trips were taken to Chicago and to France in her mission to educate.
These memorable events were always anticipated by Faye and greeted
with enthusiasm by her students. For a number of years, she served
as class advisor, particularly enjoying building and decorating
floats for homecoming and decorating the gym for junior prom
activities. Throughout her life, Faye maintained an untiring interest
in the students at MSHS, often asking parents about their children,
even through the children may never have been her students and she
kept in regular contact with students who were now living adult
lives, with families of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition
to her affiliations at MSHS as foreign language department head for
several years, class advisor for the MSHS graduating class of 2008,
and serving on numerous parent-teacher committees, Faye was also a
member of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption and the Ladies
Philoptochos Society, and active in civic committees such as the
American Association of University Women and the Marquette
Beautification Committee. In her leisure, Faye loved walking her
dog, Mario, for the 13 years of his life, bicycling, running – even
participating in marathons in Detroit and France, and riding in her
boat on beautiful Lake Superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faye is
survived by her husband, John; her cherished son, Bret; two sisters,
Stephanie (Bob) Trumm and Jayme (Rick) Iknoiah both of California;
her mother-in-law, Leone Amo of Ironwood; brothers-in-law, Tom Amo
of Philadelphia, PA, Jim (Brooke) Amo of Livonia, and Ken Amo of
Ft Worth, TX; and several nieces and nephews. Faye was preceded in
death by her father, the honorable judge, Stephen J. Catel, her
mother, Ethel Catel; brother-in-law, Andrew Walton; and father-in-law,
John M. Amo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family will receive friends
at the Swanson-Lundquist Funeral Home on Sunday from 4:00 pm until
7:00 pm. Trisagion will be held at 6:00 pm. The Funeral Liturgy
will be held on Monday, July 18, at 11:00 am at the Greek Orthodox
Church of the Assumption with Rev. Tom Michalos officiating. Burial
will be made in the Park Cemetery. Pallbearers will be Jimmy Pedakis,
Lou Roumanis, Paul Andronis, Paul Wainio, Gary Shaffer, and Craig
Cox. Memorials may be directed to the Greek Orthodox Church of the
Assumption, 235 W. Ridge Street, Marquette, MI 49855 or to the Faye
Amo Scholarship Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 101 W. Washington Street,
Marquette, MI 49855. Condolences may be expressed online at
www.swansonlundquistfuneralhome.com Adieu Madame Amo. Repose en
paix.&lt;/p&gt;
