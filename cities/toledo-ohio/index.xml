      <description>See toledowiki.net&amp;#0160;for a city wiki for Toledo, Ohio. As of this writing it has 113 users, who have created 362 pages about the city.
It&amp;#39;s always interesting to see a city wiki start up, and by stumbling around the first few pages you get a sense for the places that are at the interesting core of a city. The first few coffee shops that are mapped tell you where people care enough to share their places to work, and the flyers collection lets you see what&amp;#39;s on the bulletin boards around town.</description>
