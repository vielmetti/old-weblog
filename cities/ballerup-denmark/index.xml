&lt;p&gt;The first computer that I ever had all to myself was the Olivetti Programma 101. This was a 1965-era Italian machine that was just a little more than a programmable calculator. It used flexible magnetic cards for program storage, discrete logic for all of its computing functions, delay line memory (240 bytes), and it all sat in a 65 pound package. Output was on a humming little printer built into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graveraet Middle School in Marquette had one of these, presumably discarded from its use in the school administration. By 1977 the machine was so completely obsolete that it sat idle, with no one knowing how it worked. I got plenty of time to spend with the system, and frankly I never really figured it out either. It was easy enough to use it as an adding and multiplying and dividing machine, but the mysteries of its program logic escaped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several folks who have active projects to restore the old system, including a project at the DataMuseum in Denmark. &lt;a href=&#34;http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Olivetti/Programma_101/Revive&#34;&gt;See their efforts here.&lt;/a&gt; There are quite a lot of mechanical parts in this old machine, including a set of 8 pulleys that drove the various bits of the card reader and the printer. Rubber rollers of course get old and decayed with time so every account of a restoration has some discussion of that repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo at the top is from Michigan Tech, written by James D. Spain, who outlines the use of the Programma 101 &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.mtu.edu/biological/2012/03/origins-of-the-computer-simulation-program-in-biology-at-michigan-tech/&#34;&gt;in the biology program at Tech in 1969.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video, &amp;ldquo;Quando Olivetti invent√≤ il PC&amp;rdquo;, with a history showing the machine in action.&lt;/p&gt;
