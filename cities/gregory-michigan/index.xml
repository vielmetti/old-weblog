      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some reports from around the state of the strawberry crop.&amp;#0160; (We&amp;#39;re planning a trip to Rowe&amp;#39;s in Rawsonville for Father&amp;#39;s Day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45468&#34;&gt;From the Detroit Free Press via FreshPlaza:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;At DeGroot&amp;#39;s Strawberries in Gregory, 16 acres of lush plants are close to ripening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s
not too hot and could be a little warmer,&amp;quot; says Marsha DeGroot, who
with her family has owned the Livingston County farm since 1978. &amp;quot;But
the lovely winter with lots of snow made for a nice insulating blanket
for the plants.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick-your-own strawberries will be $1.20 a
pound at DeGroot&amp;#39;s this year. Whittaker&amp;#39;s strawberries sell for $1.25 a
pound. And at Rowe&amp;#39;s Produce Farm in Ypsilanti, the cost is $1.46 per
pound, up 3 cents from last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=45470&#34;&gt;From mlive.com again via FreshPlaza&lt;/a&gt; on the season in mid-Michigan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Geri R. Hingston and her husband, James H. Hingston, own Hingstons
Country, 18670 Dice in Merrill, a 4-acre you-pick farm with
strawberries and other produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customers usually begin
harvesting the fruit about June 14, but she said she probably will
delay by five or more days because of cooler weather, frost warnings
and bees not coming out to pollinate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/528487.html&#34;&gt;A June 8 story in the Marquette Mining Journal (via the Escanaba Press) about UP strawberries:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;There were also a few days where overnight lows dropped close to
the freezing mark at the Delta County Airport, however, it is possible
inland areas did drop to or below freezing,&amp;quot; said Fleegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;A call by the Daily Press to Victor Ledvina, owner of Ledvina&amp;#39;s Strawberry Farm in Flat Rock was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;There was also no indication of when picking would begin at Ledvina&amp;#39;s Strawberry Farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Dave
Pellegrini, operator of Pellegrini&amp;#39;s Strawberry Farm said they had been
irrigating five out of the past eight nights to prevent the fragile
blossoms from frosting over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The full moon in June is called the strawberry moon; it was on June 7.&lt;/p&gt;
