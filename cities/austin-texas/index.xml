      <description>SXSW is &#34;spring break for geeks&#34;. Every year the nerd bird flies hundreds of people from San Francisco to Austin (and to be fair other airplanes fly other people from other places to Austin). There&#39;s a good solid week of product demos, parties, music, film, etc. It sounds like fun, and I&#39;ve never gone. I&#39;m wondering what my alternate history would have been if I would have been a regular there - who would I know that I don&#39;t know now, what connections I&#39;d make, etc.</description>
