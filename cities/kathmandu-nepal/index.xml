      <description>My command of the Nepali language is extremely limited, Somewhere on a bookshelf somewhere in the house I have this cookbook
 and its recipe for &#34;gundruk&#34;, a fermented leafy vegetable that I have never tried to make and have not found to eat anywhere here locally.
There is a lot of news from Nepal as a result of the tragic earthquake, and the thought goes to try to read at least a tiny piece of the news in the original language.</description>
