      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Flood Network is making a flood detection network in
the UK, using low cost sensors and volunteers. They are sharing
their &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/oxfloodnet&#34;&gt;code on Github&lt;/a&gt; and their
results on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flood_network&#34;&gt;Flood_Network&lt;/a&gt;
Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They encourage you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://flood.network/join&#34;&gt;join their effort&lt;/a&gt;,
and no high technology is necessary. The network incorporates
both readings from automated sensors (about Â£250) as well as
manual readings from gaugeboards or photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New as of December 2015 is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nominet.uk/iot-technology-powers-an-interactive-flood-map-and-sensor-network/&#34;&gt;interactive flood map&lt;/a&gt;.
A post from Nominet describes the effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominet, in association with the Flood Network, is today launching an interactive, online map which visualises river and stream levels around Oxford. The map, showing how technology can be a part of flood defence systems anywhere, has been developed following a successful pilot project with the Oxford Flood Network. The project has been focused on exploring the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas for the first time in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is using TVWS (&amp;ldquo;TV white space&amp;rdquo;) as its wide area backhaul
network for these sensors for hard-to-reach devices that are outside
of the range of wifi. Cost-effective and reliable access to remote
small sensors is one of the tough spots in Internet of Things development,
it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see TVWS as a possible solution to this issue.
The other relevant technology for low-cost metro area networks for
sensors is Lorawan, more about which later.&lt;/p&gt;
