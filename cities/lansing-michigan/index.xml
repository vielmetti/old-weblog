      <description>The ice storm of late December 2013 hit the Lansing area hard, and the municipal power authority has not handled the resulting outages as well as citizens would have them do. The Lansing, Michigan area has electrical service from LBWL, the Lansing Board of Water and Light. Even though the surrounding area is served by Consumers Energy, LBWL serves an area roughly encompassing Lansing and East Lansing. For one thing, LBWL does not maintain an outage map online, which is relatively unusual in this day and age.</description>
