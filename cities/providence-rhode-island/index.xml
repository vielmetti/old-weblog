&lt;p&gt;I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference
(RILA09). That gave me a chance to enter &amp;ldquo;airplane mode&amp;rdquo;,
that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to
spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I
have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy
any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in. You
are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for
your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat. Each experience is
essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful
distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit
noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less
dingy, but it&amp;rsquo;s all of a piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result then is that I am transported into a new place with this
effort, a place where I can write a postcard, read a long-forgotten
book, or work within the confines of my laptop without the infinite
global distraction of the Internet. Frankly, the infinite global
distraction of the Internet is not conducive to reasonable thought
- it demands attention, reply, responsiveness, and engagement, &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;,
whether you want it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard, but not impossible, to reconstruct airplane mode in the
rest of the day. The appropriate cafe can be a part of it, at least
for the ritual coffee experience. It helps a lot to have a tool
like Freedom (Mac OS X) that enforces a bit of network downtime for
you by shutting down all Internet links for a period of time.&amp;#0160;
The telephone is harder, but almost every call can be made
to wait if you plan carefully enough to create a signal for what
is actually urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m offline, I write with different tools, and thus my thinking
is different. Entering text into &amp;quot;vim&amp;quot;, my old
standby favorite text mode editor, triggers different brainwaves
that does keying things carefully into a web form. Not feeling
like I have to hyperlink every third word frees up the brain for
internal connections instead of external connections.
There&amp;rsquo;s rarely a need to hide from flashing distracting advertising
or to spend time deleting spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, being online was the exception rather than the
rule - some part of my far away brain remembers that and wants to
get back to that earlier, simpler day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes-afterwards&#34;&gt;notes afterwards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/05/freedom-to-go-o.html&#34;&gt;Freedom:
previously described here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a possible answer for using &lt;a href=&#34;http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/06/use-notepad-vim-or-any-text-editor-with.html&#34;&gt;vim
as an alternative text editor in firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;once upon a time is roughly the UUCP era, when there was email and
netnews but no web and hardly ever any real time communications
unless you were all logged into the same machine.&lt;/p&gt;
