      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ann Arbor City Hall, January 8, 2016 - A brief report from a jammed
Council committee meeting held in the council workroom. The committee
moved public comment time to the begining of the meeting to hear
concerns of citizens who objected to a previous decision of the committee,
memorialized as follows on Legistar as 15-1179 enacted on October 16, 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution to Approve a Request from Aquamarine Springs, LLC for a New Micro-Brewer, Small Wine-Maker, Small Distiller Liquor License and Dance/Entertainment Permit, to be Located at 507 S. Ashley Street Sponsors: Council Liquor License Review Committee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee noted that the building is located in the floodway and is also part of the Old West Side Historic District. Committee members discussed the fact that any renovation to the building would require further review by the Fire and Building Departments and may also require site plan approval. It was noted that this approval was only for the applicant to proceed with the liquor license application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A motion was made by Councilmember Kailasapathy, seconded by Councilmember Lumm, that the Resolution be recommended for approval to the City Council on 10/19/2015. On a voice vote, the Chair declared the motion carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizens at the meeting objected to this decision, both
that they were not properly informed of the decision making
at the time as well as the observation that there is a preschool
nearby that should have the right to object to the decision.
Several people at this meeting had gone to Lansing to register their
complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on the docket was a proposal from Glass House Brewing LLC for
a &amp;ldquo;New Micro-Brewer Liquor License to be Located at 2350 W. Liberty
Street&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later as time and space warrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Arborwiki: &lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Aquamarine_Springs&#34;&gt;Aquamarine Springs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Glass_House_Brewing&#34;&gt;Glass House Brewing&lt;/a&gt;,
both are just the start of the articles at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
