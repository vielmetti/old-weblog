      <description>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out from the Ann Arbor District Library.
Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m looking forward to reading&amp;#0160;Adam Grant&amp;#39;s book&amp;#0160;Give and Take&amp;#0160;(aadl). &amp;#0160;Look in the March 31 NY Times Magazine for a preview, featuring a quote from the U of Michigan&amp;#39;s Jerry Davis. At the moment I&amp;#39;m&amp;#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&amp;#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!
The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:
 Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.</description>

      <description>A few highlights, not the whole talk.
My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.
For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.
Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;followers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</description>
