      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fb27046c970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fb27046c970b&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Dogecoinlogo&#34; title=&#34;Dogecoinlogo&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a3fb27046c970b-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It&#39;s distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated. Case in point, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html&#34;&gt;hack of Dogewallet&lt;/a&gt; caused several people&#39;s stash of Dogecoins to vanish into the hands of an as of yet unknown person who managed to get to the file system of the Dogewallet &#34;secure&#34; system and change the destination address for Dogecoin transfers. About 30 million coins were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are on the the &lt;a href=&#34;http://doges.org/index.php/topic,5283.0.html&#34;&gt;Dogecoin forum&lt;/a&gt;, and I found out about this via Clay Shirky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Long story short, as we&#39;re learning the hard way, never trust a web wallet with anything you&#39;d be afraid to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin was all libertarian cryptocurrency fun til ~30M coins were stolen from Dogewallet. Now people want the cops: &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/ooi4xXMf25&#34;&gt;http://t.co/ooi4xXMf25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Clay Shirky (@cshirky) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cshirky/statuses/416067071076626432&#34;&gt;December 26, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Spy vs spy: Tor (US Naval Intelligence designed anonymous network) attacked by NSA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c&#34; alt=&#34;Images&#34; title=&#34;Images&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affc67f89970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.torproject.org/&#34;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt; runs Tor (&#34;The Onion Router&#34;), a network designed to provide its users with anonymity when using the Internet. Tor was originally developed by US Naval Intelligence, and a large part of support for the network still comes from government interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tor was in the news recently as the high profile Silk Road anonymous marketplace for drugs was shut down. Silk Road had been hosted as a hidden node reachable only through Tor, and it ran openly on that network for years until a dedicated effort unmasked the organizer. The description of the resources used to take down Silk Road did not mention any specific attacks on Tor; the proprietor of Silk Road left behind enough clues through sloppy tradecraft that it was possible through diligent efforts to identify him based on his public postings. The takedown of Silk Road caused a disturbance in the Force as seen through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/10/bitcoin-volatility-after-silk-road-shutdown.html&#34;&gt;volatility in Bitcoin prices&lt;/a&gt; seen right after the system was taken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently the Guardian printed a Bruce Schneier piece on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity&#34;&gt;Attacking Tor: how the NSA targets users&#39; online anonymity&lt;/a&gt;. It goes into detail on the flaws in browser implementations that can be used to attack Tor anonymity as well as the peculiar attacks that only the NSA can take out by doing monkey-in-the-middle attacks on the Tor (and Internet) infrastructure. It&#39;s a good read, and exposes such lovely NSA code names as &#34;EgotisticalGiraffe&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the Schneier piece is that it&#39;s not impossible to unmask the anonymity of Tor users, especially if they are sloppy in any way in their use of the system; there are enough bugs to go around in the components that make up a typical Tor browser bundle that it&#39;s likely that a dedicated effort to entrap a specific user will succeed. But it&#39;s hard work, and thus the Tor system works as its Naval Intelligence designers intended - only the most determined state actor can foil typical use of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bitcoin volatility after Silk Road shutdown</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-02-bitcoin-volatility-after-silk-road-shutdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The markets have not been kind to Bitcoin over the past few hours. Here&#39;s a 24 hour snapshot from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bitcoinity.org/markets&#34;&gt;Bitcoin price tracking site Bitcoinity&lt;/a&gt;. What you see is a steady state of $140 per Bitcoin disrupted into a steep decline to $110, and then a ragged recovery up towards the $125 level. Your guess is good as mine what the rate will be in the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM&#34; title=&#34;Screen shot 2013-10-02 at 3.37.32 PM&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019affbd614d970d-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the volatility? It turns out that a popular Bitcoin trading site, Silk Road, has been shut down by the Feds. Silk Road was known for its free and easy Bitcoin-fueled trading in drugs, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-raid-idUSL1N0HS12C20131002&#34;&gt;indictment alleges&lt;/a&gt; that the proprietor, a certain Ross William Ulbricht, known as &#34;Dread Pirate Roberts,&#34; also used the site to plan a contract &#34;hit&#34; on someone who crossed his path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, many more comments are on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6482992&#34;&gt;the Hacker News story&lt;/a&gt;, and an account of the Bitcoin volatility in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/02/crime-silkroad-bitcoin-idUSL1N0HS1Q820131002&#34;&gt;a Reuters followup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Bitcoin: notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of 5/22/13</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-22-introduction-to-bitcoin-notes-from-the-michigan-bitcoin-meetup-of-52213/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 23:14:55 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-22-introduction-to-bitcoin-notes-from-the-michigan-bitcoin-meetup-of-52213/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some notes from the Michigan Bitcoin meetup of May 22, 2013. They are in no way reflective of everything that was discussed at the meeting; indeed, there&amp;#39;s some things here that we didn&amp;#39;t talk about at the meeting that I discovered later. But here goes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. How does Bitcoin work? I&amp;#39;m looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Khan Academy series on Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and listened to one lecture which seems to spell it out quite well. I don&amp;#39;t claim to know enough to describe the cryptographic ins and out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What can you do with Bitcoin? First, you can mine for new Bitcoins; that&amp;#39;s popular, either with GPU-based mining tools or FPGAs or other specialized hardware (this &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;mining hardware comparison&lt;/a&gt; is useful). Second, you can use Bitcoin to purchase goods and services, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/05/09/25-things-i-learned-about-bitcoin-from-living-on-it-for-a-week/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;this Forbes reporter&amp;#39;s account on living on Bitcoin for a week&lt;/a&gt; is entertaining for a variety of reasons. Third, you can speculate in Bitcoin, hoping to buy low and sell high. Finally, you can build software and systems that help people do all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What are the risks of Bitcoin? First and foremost among those building software and systems, the problem is uncertainty of regulations, especially dealing with money laundering and financial crimes rules. The recent document &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Application of FinCEN&amp;#39;s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from March 2013 will need to be studied and pondered by everyone involved. The Washington Post (among many others) &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-15/business/39274717_1_money-laundering-monetary-policy-currency&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;reported on Mt. Gox&amp;#39;s troubles with FinCEN&lt;/a&gt; and the seizure of funds from their account. There are also technical hurdles, such as the vulnerability of exchanges to denial of service attacks and the recent wild fluctuations in Bitcoin exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. How is this different from other virtual currencies? (I&amp;#39;m thinking now Beenz, Flooz, Linden Dollars, Cybercash, Digicash, and the like.) See US News &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/slideshows/6-virtual-currencies-that-went-bust&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Six virtual currencies that went bust&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Where is the action? In Ann Arbor, there&amp;#39;s a startup exchange &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbox.mx/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Bitbox&lt;/a&gt;. In Berlin, there&amp;#39;s the Kreuzberg district, with shops that accept Bitcoin (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/26/bitcoins-gain-currency-in-berlin&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;so says the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-blY0Gv3o&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Winkelvoss twins&lt;/a&gt; are in on the business. San Jose was the home of the conference &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bitcoin2013.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Bitcoin 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Things are hopping all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Bitcoin is too mainstream, where can I go for more experimental moneys? Try &lt;a href=&#34;http://junkcoin.org/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;JunkCoin&lt;/a&gt;, which puts an element of randomness into mining, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://ripple.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;quot;world&amp;#39;s first open payment network&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not really a summary of the meeting, but it&amp;#39;s a summary of the things that I didn&amp;#39;t know before that I now know a bit(coin) better.&lt;/p&gt;
