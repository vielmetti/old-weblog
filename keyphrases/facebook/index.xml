      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve deleted Facebook from my phone, though I haven&#39;t closed out my account there. Look for me to be there less and here (on this blog) more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a never ending stream. You start to look at it, and you are never done. There&#39;s never a &#34;congratulations, you are all caught up&#34; message to be found. It&#39;s just too big to make sense of, and too much of a potential time sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this hiatus will be temporary, as I have previously &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/10/twitter-zero.html&#34;&gt;quit Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and look at me now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;The only way to win is not to play.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the time I have left from not being on Facebook I should be able to send more postcards, write more blog entries, sort through some accumulated paper, and what not. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s any shortage of other things to do in person and on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: When I don&#39;t look at Facebook, I look at this weblog more; and when I look at this weblog, I do more tech stuff and less non-tech stuff. That&#39;s an OK balance.&lt;/p&gt;
