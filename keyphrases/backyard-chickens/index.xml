from UPI in their &#34;quirks&#34; section:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Officials in Ann Arbor, Mich., are working on a plan to allow residents of the college town to set up their own chicken coops.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;City Councilman Stephen Kunselman told his colleagues during the weekend there is support among residents who like the idea of having access to &#34;farm fresh&#34; eggs, which some foodies consider to be tastier and healthier than the store-bought variety.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To the reader: a challenge to update the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Chicken_coops&#34;&gt;chicken coops&lt;/a&gt; page on Arborwiki, noting the urban history of residential avian husbandry, and to document in particular the tipping point at which eggs from your back yard went from being a sign of prosperity to something else.
&lt;/p&gt;
