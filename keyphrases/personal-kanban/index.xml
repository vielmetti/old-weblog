      <title>Using Github Issues and Waffle.io as a personal kanban board</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some
time now, and since November I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything
that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to
less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&amp;rsquo;s usually a lot
of duplicates; at less than 100 I&amp;rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&amp;rsquo;s
something to be done). The &amp;ldquo;Ready&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;In Progress&amp;rdquo; queues hold no more than
5 tasks apiece, since I want to keep everything in that state visible on
the screen. Finally the &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; queue reflects how much work there is that
actually got accomplished over the last week, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to say that was
hovering at about 50 tasks a week though right now it&amp;rsquo;s only at 34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github issues are more than capable of handling a personal todo list - indeed
it has a lot of features that if you tried to use all of them you&amp;rsquo;d quickly
find that too much of your time was perfecting your lists and not enough
time was spent doing things. So the challenge is coming up with a simple
configuration of the system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ignore what might be done, but that
focuses on what really needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspriation for all of this is Jim Benson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Personal Kanban&amp;rdquo;, and his
observation that really the task simplifies down to two rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit work in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is merely commentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Now I get to drag task 3568, &amp;ldquo;Write up use of Waffle for Vacuum blog&amp;rdquo;, into the
&amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; category, which is kinetically very satisfactory.)&lt;/p&gt;
