      <description>&amp;#0160;From Cynthia Hodges on Facebook:
 Train hit a semi carrying kayaks at Foster Bridge Maple Rd Huron River Dr. Truck driver jumped out of cab before impact. We came upon it right after it happened...doesn&amp;#39;t look like anyone was hurt.
 This happened at about 1:00pm on Saturday, May 25, 2013, according to AnnArbor.com.

UPDATE: The Ann Arbor Chronicle has a longer account of what happened.</description>

      <description>Please enjoy this video from Youtube user &#34;trainluvr&#34; in glorious Super 8 showing the trip from Detroit to Chicago on Amtrak. The whole journey takes just 8 minutes, 16 seconds in time lapse. For a detailed log of every location in the trip, see this Trainsim thread, Amtrak Cab Ride Timelapse. Ypsilanti is at 0:58, Ann Arbor is at 1:06, Battle Creek at 2:49, Niles at 5:40 and Chicago at 7:34.</description>

      <description>In summary, the train will be late, and it will be later than you had previously expected it to be late because of delays on the line due to the track owner (Norfolk Southern) restricting the speed of the track user (Amtrak). &amp;#0160;See Amtrak Train Status History for details.
 More discussion is scattered around the net; I found a good thread at this RailroadFan.com site (&amp;quot;Norfolk Southern cuts train speeds&amp;quot;) with some discussion of the various rail infrastructure in the area including the three NS paths from Detroit to Chicago (via the Wabash and via Toledo) making the more direct Michigan Central line less critical for freight use.</description>
