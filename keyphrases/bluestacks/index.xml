      <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t run on 10.5.8, so I&amp;#39;m holding this review until after I upgrade to 10.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t work on 10.6.8 either, just coming up with a &amp;quot;Loading&amp;quot; screen that hangs their seemingly forever. I&amp;#39;m on an early 2008 MacBook, certainly not the fastest computer in the world, but one that is usually adequate to the task of running most software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After prompt help from Bluestacks tech support, I tried again, this time first closing my Chrome browser windows before starting. Lo and behold, it fired up promptly. The diagnosis &amp;#0160;was &amp;quot;not enough memory&amp;quot;, and sure enough once I turned off my browser there was enough memory left to get it to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all I could tell of using the system with one app loaded (Twitter), it was a faithful emulation of the Android environment. There&amp;#39;s an app store or two so that you can get new stuff. But once I started to load more than one app at a time, the system started to bog down again, and the output from &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; showed a load average of 7+ and no free system memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m willing concede that it might work on some computers, but it&amp;#39;s not working well enough on mine to be anything but a curiousity. It certainly can&amp;#39;t run on this system at the same time as my browser. There is hope that a future release will be more sparing of memory, in which case I&amp;#39;ll give it another try.&lt;/p&gt;
