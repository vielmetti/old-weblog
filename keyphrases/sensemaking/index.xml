      <description>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly part of the same easy to define train of thought. It&amp;rsquo;s note to self, or note to future self, for the sorts of things that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again. It&amp;rsquo;s notes about places I&amp;rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&amp;rsquo;d like to go to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get interested enough in something to write down what I find out about it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that find it (and more) so I can learn more.</description>
