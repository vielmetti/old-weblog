      <title>proximity, distance, and expertise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The challenge of being an expert is that it is hard to be one in
your own home town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise is valued when it comes from far away. The traveling
scholar is special for their pure understanding of a difficult
field, and they don&amp;rsquo;t incur the baggage of being a neighbor or even
a friend. The distinguished visitor can be an exemplar of their
craft, not distracted by any complicated local entanglements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be recognized as an expert you need to be prepared
to travel beyond where you are well understood out to the parts of
the world where you are known solely for your expertise. Go beyond
your narrow orbit and strike out to a place where your reputation
is solid and where you are an example of the thing you call your
own. Leave your own neighborhood behind, even if only to be seen
elsewhere as an expert on neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise is a funny thing. You don&amp;rsquo;t always get a chance to pick
what you are good at, because that can come from the views of others.
The further away those others are, the more likely they have some
essential insight into your character that your close neighbors
will never have. Look at yourself through the eyes of someone far
away and see what special characteristics appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Written mostly on a mobile phone while in a familiar cafe.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>relevance in social networks - a function of local density</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This very interesting phrase gets exactly one search hit in Google,
a use in the book &amp;ldquo;Network Analysis: Methodological Foundations&amp;rdquo;
by Ulrik Brandes, Thomas Erlebach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting my copy via inter-library loan (yay Melcat) and hope
to dig through it.  The relevant chapter is on &amp;ldquo;local density&amp;rdquo;,
which looks to have all kinds of NP-hard math about finding dense
clusters, cliques, and  inside networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a portion of a social network more relevant than the
rest of it?  I.e., if you want to partition a network into an
&amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; part and a &amp;ldquo;less interesting&amp;rdquo; part, how do you cut
it?  This is then a property less of any individual ego and more a
property of a subset of the group.   Large networks have enormous
(and computationally difficult) different ways they can be sliced
up, so you have to have some heuristics that lead you to the right
places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a network like the internet, where do you measure &amp;ldquo;local density&amp;rdquo;?
Decide how much it matters that people are in the same place at the
same time, and how much it matters that they quote each other all
the time, and how much it matters that they sync up even though
they are far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
