      <description>The challenge of being an expert is that it is hard to be one in your own home town.
Expertise is valued when it comes from far away. The traveling scholar is special for their pure understanding of a difficult field, and they don&amp;rsquo;t incur the baggage of being a neighbor or even a friend. The distinguished visitor can be an exemplar of their craft, not distracted by any complicated local entanglements.</description>

      <description>This very interesting phrase gets exactly one search hit in Google, a use in the book &amp;ldquo;Network Analysis: Methodological Foundations&amp;rdquo; by Ulrik Brandes, Thomas Erlebach.
I&amp;rsquo;m getting my copy via inter-library loan (yay Melcat) and hope to dig through it. The relevant chapter is on &amp;ldquo;local density&amp;rdquo;, which looks to have all kinds of NP-hard math about finding dense clusters, cliques, and inside networks.
What makes a portion of a social network more relevant than the rest of it?</description>
