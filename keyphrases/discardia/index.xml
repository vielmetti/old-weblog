      <description>Discardia is a quarterly holiday where we decide to let go of some things around us in order to make way to do things for the new season. It&amp;#39;s a modern invention of Dinah Sanders, who writes about it at discardia.com. The season runs from the solstice or equinox to the following new moon. For summer 2011, the dates are June 21 through July 1.
For my kids, Lego is the part of their existence which most calls out for straightforward decisionmaking to create order amidst the chaos.</description>

      <description>The challenge is to get rid of some set of books that have accumulated, while simultaneously fulfilling the need to always have some kind of new reading in the house. &amp;#0160;
A new (to me) way to do this is Paperback Swap, a system which works as a trading board for books. &amp;#0160;You are entitled to books in the proportion that you send books to others, and every book you request is free to you.</description>

      <description>The season of discardia is upon us again. &amp;#0160;
It&amp;#39;s time to unsubscribe from mailing lists, take out the trash, empty out your pockets, weigh your inbox and reduce its weight, clean out the cupboards and more.
It&amp;#39;s also time for me to stop even pretending that I can follow everything that have at one time been interested in and let some things that fascinate me slip by the wayside for a while, so that in some future I can come back to them and be surprised by how much progress has been made since I was gone.</description>

      <description>Discardia is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.
Priority one is a book purge; I&amp;#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house.</description>

      <description>Dinah made up a holiday called Discardia. She wrote:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place in the time between the Solstices &amp;amp; Equinoxes and their following new moons. Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&amp;rsquo;t buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that you have enough.</description>

      <description>What is Discardia?
 Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas you no longer need. It&#39;s about letting go, abdicating from obligation and guilt, being true to the self you are now. Discardia is the time to get rid of things that no longer add value to your life, shed bad habits, let go of emotional baggage and generally lighten your load. - Dinah Sanders  Discardia was the theme of today&#39;s a2b3 Thursday lunch.</description>
