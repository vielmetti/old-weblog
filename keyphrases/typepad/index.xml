      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad. The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&amp;rsquo;ve been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes and what-not. It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to review old words.
One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at times system called Zemanta. Zemanta would figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions for related links, both to things that you had written as well as to things other people had written.</description>
