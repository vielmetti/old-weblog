      <description>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly part of the same easy to define train of thought. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;note to self&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;note to future self&amp;rdquo;, for the sorts of things that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again. It&amp;rsquo;s notes about places I&amp;rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&amp;rsquo;d like to go to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get interested enough in something to write down what I find out about it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that find it (and more) so I can learn more.</description>

      <description>Part of what I hope will be a series of posts, and with that I hope some publishable output at the end; my guess is that if I write about this a dozen times I&#39;ll have 1800 publishable words on the topic when I&#39;m done.

Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future.</description>

      <title>Blogger&#39;s secret: note to future self</title>

      <description>Part of an occasional &amp;quot;blogger&#39;s secret&amp;quot; series.
Write for yourself. Really, you are best off with an audience of one to start, and use your time and effort to write down things that you will want to read in a week or a month or a year. If you are interesting to your audience of one, you have some hope of being interesting to some other person somewhere else on the planet who is interested in you.</description>
