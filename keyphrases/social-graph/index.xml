      <description>Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &amp;quot;social graph&amp;quot;. Techmeme&amp;#39;s front page has plenty of commentary.
I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:
 For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&amp;#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled.</description>
