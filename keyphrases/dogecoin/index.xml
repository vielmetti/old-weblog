      <description>Dogecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin, in the sense that it has the same structure as Bitcoin of being backed by cryptography and by conspicuous consumption of computing power and electricity. It&#39;s distinguished from Bitcoin in that Dogecoin is also backed by a meme of a cute dog. Such currency! Very profit!
Everything is fun and games until the criminal element gets involved, in which case you can be pretty sure that your cryptocurrency has been validated.</description>
