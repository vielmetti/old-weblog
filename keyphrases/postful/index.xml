      <description>Lob.com has an API to send postcards-as-a-service ($0.70 per each, full custom both sides). Details at https://lob.com/services/postcards . It works, but all of the user interface is up to you; if you know a good service for delivering a single full-custom postcard with postage that actually has a user interface and not an API for less than $1.00 each, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll update here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started checking in a few tiny utility programs that exercise the Lob API.</description>

      <description>FIXED, see the bottom.&amp;#0160; 12/31
rather than give up in total frustration, here&amp;#39;s what I am trying to implement, using &amp;quot;curl&amp;quot; to drive the system.&amp;#0160; This is from the &amp;quot;postful&amp;quot; API docs.
1. Upload the document. To uploading a document, submit a POST to:
http://www.postful.com/service/upload Be sure to include the Content-Type and Content-Length headers and the document itself as the body of the request.
POST /upload HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 301456</description>
