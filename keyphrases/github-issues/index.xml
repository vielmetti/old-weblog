      <description>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once, and it stuck.
A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on.</description>
