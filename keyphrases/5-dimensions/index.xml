      <description>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game &#34;2048&#34;. (No, I won&#39;t link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating 2048 5D I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. 5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it.</description>
