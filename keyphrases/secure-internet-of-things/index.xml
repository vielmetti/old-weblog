      <description>A bus labeled &amp;ldquo;TRAINING&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t take that one.
Kayakers in bright yellow kayaks on the Huron River under the bridge on Fuller Road.
Would it be too much to ask to have wifi actually on the blue bus, or is it more reasonable to expect that people have cell data coverage everywhere and that wifi on the bus is for long haul buses like Megabus?
I&amp;rsquo;m happy that with Hugo I can have a reasonably complete local blogging environment completely independent of having Internet access, so long as I have my computer with me.</description>
