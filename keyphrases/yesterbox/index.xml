      <description>I&#39;m a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It&#39;s hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today&#39;s email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday&#39;s mail you are really done.
The slight complication for this system for me is that I&#39;m also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do.</description>
