      <description>The video, entitled &#34;It is pitch dark&#34;, from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot.

The lyrics, in part:
You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue?
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.</description>
