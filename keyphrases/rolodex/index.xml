      <description>&lt;p&gt;The evening&#39;s work can be roughly summed up as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with &#39;A&#39;. Much of the time, that will be a person&#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on that person&#39;s weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat until &#39;Z&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on &#34;The algorithm driven day&#34;. In reading through it I am not sure it needs to see the light of day just yet, but it does help me wonder what parts of our efforts are driven by randomness and which are put there by design and how on earth one might tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>graph-structured rolodex</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-15-graph-structured-rolodex/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook announced a new search tool today that lets you search through your &amp;quot;social graph&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techmeme.com/130115/p31#a130115p31&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Techmeme&amp;#39;s front page&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote myself this unpublished note about it a few years ago, which looks pretty much spot-on now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each person in your rolodex, draw a little graph of how they are related to others. There might be a few or there might be a dozen links you&amp;#39;d want to make explicit, and each link would have a name so the edges of the graph are also labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when you want to surprise someone with a plausible association, or bring someone to mind who had been lost to mind, you shuffle the rolodex and unearth the connections that had disappeared but that because of your graph will reappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &amp;quot;rolodex&amp;quot; will never show up in a Facebook press release, and the fact that I even mention it makes me look old.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mental rolodex</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-17-associative-memory-and-the-mental-rolodex/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a great use of the term in an LA Magazine review of &amp;quot;Run Lola Run&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credits: the &amp;quot;mental rolodex&amp;quot; term is one I heard first from&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trybean.com&#34;&gt;Terry Bean&lt;/a&gt;, who used it at an LA2M presentation. It&amp;#39;s also from&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rebekahburgess.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Rebekah Burgess&amp;#39;s weblog of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, where she is doing a daily photograph and filing that away for reference.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And kids, if you don&amp;#39;t know what a rolodex is, it&amp;#39;s from the days when people had land lines phones only and their phones were so dumb that they didn&amp;#39;t have an address book built into them. Instead, they wrote down phone numbers on little pieces of specially shaped paper, and those pieces of paper fit into a clever device that could be flipped through or (in ultra cool setup) spun like a Ferris wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
