      <description>&lt;p&gt;Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don&#39;t have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. Note that broadcasts in English are not 24 hours a day, and that shortwave reception varies widely by time of day and location of receiving station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to do this is to acquaint yourself with &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.org/&#34;&gt;WebSDR&lt;/a&gt;, a project that allows multiple listeners to tune into the signal of a single wideband radio. You&#39;ll need to pick a receiver that has an antenna that covers the appropriate part of the broadcast band, and you&#39;ll need also a schedule for when the station is broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many shortwave schedules and stations can be located via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.short-wave.info/&#34;&gt;short-wave.info&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM&#34; title=&#34;Screen Shot 2014-12-17 at 3.30.59 PM&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b8d0abdf50970c-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a schedule and a frequency, use WebSDR to find a suitable listening location. My two favorites for monitoring Havana are the original &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&#34;&gt;WedSDR at U Twente&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://96.225.100.244:8902/&#34;&gt;K2SDR in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you can tune in via &lt;a href=&#34;http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Havana-Cuba-p1687/&#34;&gt;TuneIn&lt;/a&gt; and get to the broadcast direct. The sound will be more clear, and the reception more reasonable. But there&#39;s really something to be said for experiencing broadcast radio through the medium of radio rather than this newfangled Internet thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some notes on Echolink and websdr</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server. You have to be a licensed ham to get on the network, and typically there&#39;s a two-way repeater set up to some radio station so that you can hear what&#39;s being said on RF and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;websdr is a system that lets anyone listen to a slice of radio spectrum. There are websdr servers running around the globe, each tuned in to some particular slice of the radio waves. Multiple people can tune in at the same time and hear their own piece of the airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing happens when you connect these two systems together. Some small number of the websdr receivers tune into the 2 meter band, which is the typical band used by Echolink. Using Echolink (or in my case the Mac application Echomac) I identified an Echolink host in the vicinity of the websdr receiver, then connected to it. Sure enough, I was able to hear my call sign back in through the websdr front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little image shows the result. Transmitted via DM0ZHS, and monitored at http://129.187.5.188:8901/ on 145237.50 kHz, I&#39;m sending from Isen, Germany and receiving the transmission at the Olympic Tower in Munich, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>decoding radio digital modes without a radio, using WebSDR and fldigi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in decoding radio digital modes without actually having a radio. The idea is that by using a web-based software defined radio (to tune in the signals) and the fldigi program (to decode the signals) that I should be able to &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to digital modes and start to explore the digital parts of the amateur and broadcast radio bands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c img-responsive&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Fldigi-HB9ERN&#34; title=&#34;Fldigi-HB9ERN&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a51167efb3970c-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have all of the components, but I have yet to be able to get everything to work as expected. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&#34;&gt;WebSDR&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&#34;&gt;http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/&lt;/a&gt; . This is a software-defined radio tuning  to the radio airwaves at the University of Twente in the Netherlands; it runs in your browser. There are 87 of these systems running around the world, listed at &lt;a href=&#34;http://websdr.org/&#34;&gt;websdr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&#34;&gt;fldigi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&#34;&gt;http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html&lt;/a&gt; . This software for Windows, Linux and OS X, runs on your local system and takes an audio signal and decodes it in one of many digital modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&#34;&gt;Soundflower&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&#34;&gt;https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/&lt;/a&gt; . This is a Mac system extension that allows you to redirect the audio output of one program (e.g. your browser) into the audio input of another program (e.g. fldigi). Not strictly necessary because the fldigi can also just decode whatever it hears through the computer&amp;rsquo;s built in microphone. I picked up the recommendation from an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hamradioandvision.com/websdr-digital-modes/&#34;&gt;HamRadioAndVision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of people have done Youtube videos describing what they are doing to make this work. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/component/content/article/63-sdr/290-fun-with-websdr-and-fldigi&#34;&gt;OZ9AEC&lt;/a&gt; has a 6 minute Youtube from 2009 shows reception in single channel and multichannel mode. He doesn&#39;t use Soundflower, just the built in mic of his Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not described here - and probably what I need to figure out next - are two key bits of information. Where do you tune to pick up digital signals? And, more importantly, which decoder do you use? It&#39;s not hard to pick out which modulation is being used if you have some practice, but as of this writing I couldn&#39;t readily tell you what WEFAX sounds like compared to RTTY. Still sorting through those details before I can claim to have mastered this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that this should work with a local software-defined radio as well, or even with a &#34;hardware-defined radio&#34; placed near your mic or patched in with a mic cable.&lt;/p&gt;
