      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re writing away, and you hit &amp;ldquo;publish&amp;rdquo;, and the thing
you pieced together flings its way through the ether to some
audience, real or imagined. The next day it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible
to find again unless you manage to produce the precise incantation
into a search engine. There is some long-lasting trail, to be sure,
easy enough to dredge up if someone is motivated by money or curiousity,
but for the most part the social networks of today (Facebook,
Twitter) generate most of their energy from capturing the attention of the
moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what I write here is
worthwhile to save for longer than a day, and
some would be best to be deleted and never seen again.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy though that I have it all in one place that I
can grep through, happy that I can make changes to it
easily enough, and happy that it can be deleted or unpublished
without much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
