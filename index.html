      </h3>
      <p>Eight of us met for lunch at <a href="http://aysesturkishcafe.com/">Ayse&rsquo;s</a> today. It was a normal
Thursday in that regard, as that&rsquo;s a pretty typical size for
the lunch group these days.</p>

<p>We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time
to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning
or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a
remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make
sure that the things that needed to get done got done. Among the
tasks that took up lots more time than they deserved included
dealing with the health insurance marketplace and with other
healthcare providers for dealing with billing and accounting problems.</p>

<p>Three of the people at lunch were new to the table, but since Ann
Arbor is bascially a small town, it was not a surprise to me that
I had easily identifiable mutual friends with two of them.</p>

<p>Food was delicious, well prepared and well presented.</p>

<p>Next week we&rsquo;ll be back at <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/Madras_Masala">Madras Masala</a>, as art fair will have
ended and town will be more back to normal.</p>

<p>The big event coming up is <a href="http://www.makerfairedetroit.com/">Maker Faire Detroit</a>, to be held at The
Henry Ford in Dearborn.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m trying my best to get this blog ready for production.
The tasks remaining include the following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a reasonable home page with pagination. Somehow I need
to provide some kind of access to almost 2000 posts, and they
don&rsquo;t all fit on a single page. Sort through the design to make
old things reachable, and then worry next about the formatter.
(This is done at least minimally, though the provided paginator
interface uses a list structure that&rsquo;s not nice. Still, it gets
me to what I need to in a ping.) Open discussion on gohugo is
<a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441/3">Pagination and group by date</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Publish to Github Pages, using vielmetti.github.io. I did this
once (using Octopress) so it should be straightforward to do it again.
I already do have a proper github repo (or nearly proper, it may
be missing some key bits). Done; don&rsquo;t have a perfect build script
yet, but there&rsquo;s at least a start.</p></li>

<li><p>Import all sorts more nonsense here, including a bunch of Superpatron
and Blogger&rsquo;s Secret and FOIA Coordiator weblogs. There&rsquo;s no particular
reason not to make it all one big soup. Import from Typepad is problematic
but not impossible and that would be a good addition to the supported work;
in particular it&rsquo;s not evidently possible to export Markdown from Typepad,
just HTML.</p></li>

<li><p>Sort out theme issues so that I get a reasonable display for category
and subcategory pages. I may have to write some things down by hand
to get an understanding of what I really want. As it is right now
those pages render as blank, in part because I need to convert a bunch
of data imperfectly imported, which was throwing errors in my
templates, which in turn was breaking the build. Dealing with the
errored out builds is a question again for gohugo,

      </h3>
      <p>This weblog, which may or may not ever see the
light of day, is about a great many things.</p>

<p>There are other blogs waiting to be written that
don&rsquo;t have that infinite vista; they could easily
be much more narrow. What, then, do you write about?
Let&rsquo;s count some of the options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker on the Raspberry Pi, following Hypriot&rsquo;s lead.</li>
<li>Just Docker in general, and Dockerizing various things.</li>
<li>Recipes, since I have a bunch already.</li>
<li>Power Outage Maps, in particular try to wrangle data from OpenEI here.</li>
<li>FOIA, espeically Michigan FOIA, to follow my book</li>
<li>Daily Coffee and Wifi, the usual random walk</li>
<li>Civic Technology, in whatever format that takes</li>
</ul>

<p>More and more it&rsquo;s the case that the old &ldquo;Vacuum&rdquo; weblog is
feeling vacuous - not enough interaction with people, and not
the right platform to go deep on anything. And &ldquo;Typepad&rdquo; feels
really old, especially compared to everything else.</p>

<p>Fortunately if I&rsquo;m writing in Markdown I can mostly drop anything
I want anywhere it wants to go.</p>

<p>The other great weird idea of course is to mimic the old print
notebook with all kinds of nifty sidebars, one sidebar per item.</p>

<p>What do I want to have happen as a result of all of this not
inconsiderable effort? Creative control to be sure, to be able
to type something and see it appear exactly as desired on the
screen. Community engagement is another, to be part of a group
of people all working toward a common goal.</p>

<p>Of course the other thing that I could do is take some old weblog,
revisit it, and republish it in some other format. Blogger&rsquo;s Secret
is the reasonable one to do that to. It has virutally no traffic
now, but if I re-serialized it, it might do the trick.</p>

      <p>Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish
recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; category, and also
created a &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&rsquo;s sort of like
a subcategory but not really&hellip;well it is as long as I am careful
about it.</p>

<p>Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from
mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use
of Gopher as a cookbook. It is said that an old Mac was portable
enough to be set up in the kitchen to look up recipes.</p>

<p>What I want to do is set things up so that if the post is from the
recipes category, then the recipes list will show up in the sidebar
of that post, sorted alphabetically. I think I can make that work.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One of the challenges in getting things started is figuring
out where the end product is going to live. Hugo has its own
web server which is pretty nice, but since it generates static
pages, the results can really go anywhere.</p>

<p>This tutorial goes through the process in excruciating detail</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/">http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/</a></p>

<p>but somehow fails to make it easy. What I&rsquo;d like is a publishing
workflow that just like the normal Hugo workflow puts things online
instantly once they are built.</p>

<p>This one deploys with CodeShip</p>

<p>Yet one more, with Github hooks and S3/Cloudfront; it depends on s3cmd.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com">https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com</a></p>

<p>Finally, one that focuses on the github side of things:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950">https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950</a></p>

<p>The approach I have runs like so, it assumes that you have
a working directory &ldquo;~/src/hugo&rdquo; with your blog in it, and
a target directory &ldquo;~/src/vielmetti.github.io&rdquo; set up for
github pages.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/src/hugo
hugo -d ../vielmetti.github.io --theme=vacuum
# wait to build, then
cd ../vielmetti.github.io
git add -A .
git commit -m &quot;build complete&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>By having separate build directories like this you can keep the
continuous build on your draft setup going, and then push a
working version whenever you&rsquo;re perfectly happy with the result.
Not like anyone is really perfectly happy with any blog.</p>

<p><strong>Mac and Goat</strong> calls for goat cheese; we generally use a goat gouda or

<p>The dish also calls for rice pasta, but again feel free to substitute;
you&rsquo;re aiming for something like a rotini which handles the sauce well.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Take out a lasagna pan, which is

<p>Boil water for pasta; cook a pound or so of your favorite pasta,
we use a rice rotini pasta in this one.</p>

<p>Shred the cheese fine in a food processor or with a hand grater.</p>

<p>When the pasta is done, drain it, and then put about half of it
in the lasagna pan. Cover with about half of the cheese and half of
the tomatoes. Put the rest of the pasta in, then more tomatoes and
more cheese. Top with breadcrumbs and then sprinkle a little romano
cheese on top and a few pinches of nutmeg for flavor.</p>

<p>Cook 20-25 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the
tomato sauce is bubbling.</p>

      <p>Themes can be customized by editing the top matter, or by
directly changing the theme. The challenge is understanding
enough of how the moving parts interconnect to make it do what
you want it to do, or at least enough of them so that you don&rsquo;t
have a blog that just looks like a weak ripoff of someone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This tutorial</p>

<p><a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13">http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13</a></p>

<p>does a very nice job of helping you walk through the simple
bits. It does not get far enough to give you a sense for how
to get pagination working but that&rsquo;s at least a start.</p>

<p>There should be a super easy way to iterate through all
of the themes. I&rsquo;m looking for one that already nicely has
some way of doing categories or tags or some kind of metadata.
It would be extra super swell to find one that has a sidebar
and footer structure to so that I can (finally) recreate notebook
pages. I think I have someone that goes OK as a start - it
wants to insert dynamic content into the sidebar for the home page,
and then also to insert content that depends on the categories
or tags for individual pages, so that the whole thing feels more
like a carefully constructed notebook and less like a simple blog.</p>

<p>At some point you can iterate endlessly on appearance and completely
lose track of contents. Fortuantely I have a body of work that I really
want to see in this, so that motivates some level of forward progress.
For instance, I&rsquo;d love to see categories actually work here, since I
have some content that belongs together. I also have sidebar ideas
that really want to be exercised again.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-converting-typepad-to-hugo/">converting typepad to hugo</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The task of the night was getting a few years worth of Typepad posts
into Hugo.</p>

<p>My first step was to convert to Jekyll format, which I did using this
typepad_to_jekyll Ruby gem:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll">https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll</a></p>

<p>You then need to do a few things to get the Jekyll files exactly right
for Hugo:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the date format</li>
<li>Rewrite the Categories</li>
<li>Download and relink all of the images</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing the format for &ldquo;date&rdquo; was a one-liner in perl with the -i (&ldquo;edit in
place&rdquo;) flag.  I didn&rsquo;t get to the category rewrite or the image rescue yet.
The approach I took was to simply hack on the output files, rather than
change the source code to the typepad_to_jekyll program, but if you were
serious about it you&rsquo;d do the latter and fork it until it did the right thing.</p>

<p>Relinking all of the images requires opening a support ticket because Typepad
does not have an easy image export. Actually image hosting is a real
challenge and I don&rsquo;t know exactly the right way to do it inside Hugo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need to adjust the theme or pick a new theme so that it only shows
the first n posts on a page and then paginates, and I also need to adjust
it so that it shows categories. The show everything approach is unreasonable
when you have 1000s of pages to show off. On the other hand, the most
reasonable themes that I can find that look nice don&rsquo;t have pagination
turned on by default. There&rsquo;s some learning curve to roll my own, maybe
one that has some kind of reasonable sidebar structure.</p>

      <p>So 634 pages from my Github Gollum based Wiki markup all got imported
into Hugo and it rendered all of them in 828 ms, or basically under
a second to pull in everything I&rsquo;ve ever written. Astonishingly fast.</p>

<p>Alas, those files while they are in Markdown are not really ready for
direct import, since they have [[double brackets]] everywhere that
get uglified. The other limiting factor is the date marker that&rsquo;s not
included with them so they all show up as January 1, 0001 which is
funny the first few times and then not funny.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Hugo have an import function? It does, for converting front
matter. The closest for importing other things are the various Jekyll
converters which aren&rsquo;t really the same.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Progress, actually quite a lot of it:</p>

<p>The problem, neatly stated. Docker is good for bringing up single services ("microservices"), but sometimes your application needs more than one thing running for the whole thing to work. Enter "docker compose", formerly "fig", which automates the process of running various Docker commands in the right order with the right arguments all driven from a configuration file. As described by their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The particular task I have in front of me is launching Node-RED and mosquitto (an MQTT broker) together on a Raspberry Pi 2 which is running Hypriot and Docker. Most of the background for <em>why</em> that's a relevant task is at this post on Hypriot, <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-compose-nodejs-haproxy/">How to use Docker Compose to run complex multi container apps on your Raspberry Pi</a>, which I dutifully and successfully managed to run all of the examples from. </p>

<p>Emboldened by this I tried to get Wordpress running with MySQL but got stuck because of a variety of things (not the least of which was some over-enthusiastic documentation that downplayed the complexity of that task, and the lack of a Pi-specific Wordpress Docker images). But having had the taste of what might be I carried on until I managed to get something to work for what I really wanted: Node-RED running alongside mosquitto so that I could have a local MQTT broker to talk to.</p>

<pre>
nodered:
  image: nieleyde/rpi2-nodered
  command: flows.json
  volumes:
    - /home/pi/node-red:/root/.node-red
  ports: 
    - "1880:1880"
  links:
    - mosquitto

mosquitto:
  image: nieleyde/rpi-mosquitto
  ports:
    - "1883:1883"
</pre>

<p>Some subtleties to note:</p>

<p>The nieleyde/rpi2-nodered runs on the Pi 2; there's a corresponding nieleyde/rpi-nodered for the Pi. Both are ARM images. I haven't yet tweaked this to run on x86, but if you do, you'll need to update the "image" stanzas everywhere.</p>

<p>The "command" and "volumes" stanzas in the nodered configuration serve to make Docker mount a subdirectory on the host machine where the flows.json file is stored; this makes changes to the configuration persistent. If you want a read-only configuration, you'll need to change this; I haven't gotten that far yet. It might also make sense to have a data volume container, but again I'm not there yet.</p>

<p>The "mosquitto" configuration is extremely bare bones and runs the default config, which is wide open. I haven't gotten far enough to replace the config file with something better, but that's an obvious next step.</p>

<p>From within Node-RED you refer to this internal MQTT server at hostname "mosquitto", port "1883". If the links stanza was changed to "mqtt" and the mosquitto section was changed to "mqtt" you'd then refer to the MQTT server at hostname "mqtt".</p>

<p>For further reading:</p>

<p>An issue open on Niel Eyde's rpi-nodered Github, <a href="https://github.com/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/issues/5">documentation for how to extend this image with your own nodes and flows</a>, where I'm working some of this out.</p>

<p>I miss the days of carefully considered letters to the editor - when you could count on not every letter getting published, when you were limited to a certain number of words, and when if you were wildly off-topic your words might never see the light of day. An editor would pick a selection of letters to run, and some wouldn't make the cut.</p>

<p>Publishers who have well-edited work up front shouldn't diminish the impact of their work by giving the great unwashed Internet access to their platform to post whatever the heck they please. It detracts from the work to have unedited commentary on it posted so close to the original. At a minimum any comments should be held for approval before being posted, just so that the balance of power tips over to the editor and not to the drooling, mouth-breathing commentariat.</p>

      <p>From the BBC: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33306158">Greece's bank holiday from hell</a>. Greek banks are expected to stay shuttered for more than a week, and in the meantime depositors can only withdraw 60 euros per day.</p>

<p>The Internet spin on this is to wonder how Bitcoin will be used to evade currency controls. From Financial Post, <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/investing/bitcoin-is-the-real-winner-in-greece-crisis">Bitcoin is the real winner in Greece crisis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main driver for bitcoin prices seem to be Greek buyers.  Joshua Scigala, co-founder of Vaultoro.com, told Reuters this week that his company has seen a 124 per cent pick up in web hits from Greek IP addresses.</p>

<p>You know you're in a crisis when Bitcoin looks like a safe haven.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The evening's work can be roughly summed up as</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with 'A'. Much of the time, that will be a person's name.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment on that person's weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until 'Z'.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on "The algorithm driven day". In reading through it I am not sure it needs to see the light of day just yet, but it does help me wonder what parts of our efforts are driven by randomness and which are put there by design and how on earth one might tell the difference.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/"><code>squid</code> is a web caching system</a>. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don't have the data, and way faster when you do.</p>

<p>I'm doing some automated data collection from the web using <code>curl</code>, and as a part of that I want to not be overly aggressive in harvesting details from a site if I already have a recent copy of the data that hasn't changed. Putting a cache in the way makes sense, since unlike most GUI based browsers that have their own caches, <code>curl</code> just fetches whatever it's asked for unquestioningly even if it just got the same thing seconds ago - unless you tell it to use a cache.</p>

<p>The first appearance of squid dates to 1996, so it's old software by modern standards. It dates from the bad old days when the Internet was slow on long haul links but fast locally, and so it made all the sense in the world to optimize and economize. Even now there are lots of times and places where the net is slow enough that you're willing to introduce a little bit of complexity in exchange for a little bit of speed.</p>

<p>I installed my copy of squid on my Mac using MacPorts, which seems to do a fine job. I had also tried to build a copy of squid using what looked like simple instructions on Docker using the configuration on <a href="https://github.com/michaljemala/docker-squid">@michaeljemala/docker-squid</a>, but for reasons as of yet unexplained I got the error message</p>

<p><code>
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3128: Connection refused
</code></p>

<p>after setting that up and following package directions.  Still puzzling out whether that's a result of some Docker configuration oddness on 1.7.0, or something else. Anyway, the native version is working, so I'm good for now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don't think that's the part of the hobby I'm most interested in.</p>

<p>The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you'd think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that's hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. It feels really noisy and unnecessarily difficult. I am told that some contesters use software defined radio to watch more of the band - that seems more effective than just listening to one narrow channel and hoping for the best.</p>

<p>I guess I'm much more used to using repeaters than I am to simplex operations. With a repeater at least you have a positive acknowledgement that your transmission was received by a machine, and with that you can get a better sense for what you sound like on the air. I'm also used to a station acting as "net control" and acknowledging people and managing the flow of conversations. In contrast the contest sounds like chaos.</p>

<p>For whatever the unfamiliarity is, the other reality is that to listen to it, contests can be pretty boring. People give out the barest of bare minimum of information about their station and then move on.</p>

<p>What Field Day brings to mind is a much more interesting event I was a little part of last year, the <a href="http://www.nj2bb.org/museum/">Museum Ships Weekend Event</a> run by The Battleship New Jersey Amateur Radio Station NJ2BB. I went to the Hands-On Museum in early June 2014 and listened and talked to shipboard radio stations on museum ships around the world. It was a lot more fun because the station operators were less concerned about maximizing the count of their contacts and more interested in telling the stories of their museums. </p>

<p>The WRT54GL has a tiny amount of memory by modern standards - 4 megabytes of flash, and only 16 megabytes of system memory - but that's fine for the software of its era.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Gogs is a self-hosted Git server, an alternative to using Github as a for-pay hosted service or Gitlab as another self-hosted system. It's written in the Go language, and is said to be sparing of system resources.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 11.01.35 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 11.01.35 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a5b824970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>I'm building it using Docker on a Raspberry Pi 2, thanks to the folks at Hypriot; the writeup is <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/run-your-own-github-like-service-with-docker/">Run your own GitHub-like service with the help of Docker</a>, and the file on Dockerhub is at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian/">hypriot/rpi-gogs-raspbian</a>. The install went essentially as described; note that if you are using Avahi to provide a .local name service, you can avoid using IP addresses in configuration files and instead use names like "black-pearl.local" as your hostname.</p>

<p>Juan B. Rodriguez did a nice writeup of <a href="http://jbrodriguez.io/gogs-an-alternative-to-gitlab/">Gogs, an alternative to Gitlab</a>, again with a Docker based installation description and a nice feature comparison.</p>

<p>After some poking around with Gogs I noted three substantial limitations, none of which are complete show-stoppers but which collectively give me pause about doing a wholesale replacement of Github with Gogs; and a fourth that gives me hope for some project that might address these issues but which might not end up being called Gogs.</p>

<p>First, there's no built-in wiki. I don't always use a wiki with a Github repository, and when I do I'm not always thrilled by the minimalist features of Github's wiki, but it's mighty handy and I miss it right away. Gogs doesn't have a wiki, and though it's been an acknowledged issue for a long time it doesn't seem to have any forward movement.</p>

<p>Second, there's no built-in file editor. I'm very used to the workflow where you see a file that has some small problem, you fork the repository right in the editor, type in your fix, save, and submit your patch to the maintainers. It's a very straightforward way of doing small things efficiently without dropping down to the command line, and the lack of it makes Gogs hard to understand how it would work in a mostly-web world.</p>

<p>Third, Gogs has a lot of obvious copying from Github, and I'm uncertain about the whole ethos of wholesale replication of documentation. Sometimes there's not even an effort made to document what the system does and instead there's just a link to Github documentation. Self-hosted systems should have self-hosted documentation, and even if you're replicating someone else's system faithfully you still need to write up your own docs.</p>

<p>Fourth and finally, Gogs has been forked. "gitea" is "Git with a cup of tea", and it seems to have a bunch of energy to fix things that the Gogs project is currently lacking. See <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea">the gitea project on Github</a> and its corresponding <a href="https://gitter.im/go-gitea/gitea">gitter chat for gitea</a>. gitea has not produced a release yet, but when it does I'll be sure to look for a reasonable packaging of it to try it out.</p>

<p>All of that said, I'm happy to have found Gogs, and plan to poke through it some more and store some not-very-important files in it for a while until I get some confidence in it. I don't think it (or gitea) is an instant replacement for my hosted Github service, but for the narrow purpose of holding a private repository beyond what Github provides for its service plan it looks like a reasonable alternative now.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I followed the instructions on <a href="http://www.linuxmediaserver.net/linux-basics/streaming-webcam-raspberry-pi/">this post on LinuxMediaServer.net</a> to get an old Logitech web camera running on a Raspberry Pi 2. Here are some of the changes I did from the original to support my hardware.</p>

<p>lsusb returns this device:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 046d:08ae Logitech, Inc. QuickCam for Notebooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to add a driver for the camera:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo modprobe gspca_zc3xx</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The camera I have shows up as /dev/video0 and has a resolution of 320x240:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo ./mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so -r 320x240 -d /dev/video0" -o "./output_http.so -w www" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Existence proof, showing that it works. You should be able to recognize the Festifools t-shirt.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-27 at 12.35.07 PM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01b7c7a58928970b-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>It's not an awesome camera, but the resolution is perfectly adequate to a small task. A next challenge, should I choose to take it on, is to wrap up all of the dependencies into a Dockerfile and do a Docker build. I'm going to wait on that until Docker 1.7.1 drops since 1.7.0 is not stable on ARM platforms. I haven't yet successfully managed to get Docker on the Pi to read from USB devices (but how hard, indeed, could it be).</p>

<p>UPDATE: looks like @chuckleb built a Dockerfile for this for Ubuntu at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/chuckleb/mjpg-streamer/">chuckleb/mjpg-streamer</a>. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: If you're using the Raspberry Pi camera, <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi">Miguel Grinberg has these build instructions for that device</a>.</p>

      <p>I've deleted Facebook from my phone, though I haven't closed out my account there. Look for me to be there less and here (on this blog) more.</p>

<p>Facebook is a never ending stream. You start to look at it, and you are never done. There's never a "congratulations, you are all caught up" message to be found. It's just too big to make sense of, and too much of a potential time sink.</p>

<p>With the time I have left from not being on Facebook I should be able to send more postcards, write more blog entries, sort through some accumulated paper, and what not. It's not like there's any shortage of other things to do in person and on the net.</p>

<p>UPDATE: When I don't look at Facebook, I look at this weblog more; and when I look at this weblog, I do more tech stuff and less non-tech stuff. That's an OK balance.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Docker 1.7.0 has been released into the wild. Every .0 release of software should be expected to have some issues, no matter how good the QA and automated test process. Here's what to expect if you're getting Docker 1.7.0 up and running.</p>

<h3>boot2docker on Mac</h3>

<p>On the Mac, with boot2docker: <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/938">Docker certs not valid with 1.7 upgrade</a> is issue 938 on boot2docker. The symptom is a message like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error occurred trying to connect: Get https://192.168.59.103:2376/v1.19/containers/json: x509: certificate is valid for 127.0.0.1, 10.0.2.15, not 192.168.59.103</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and restarting docker on the VM with <code>boot2docker ssh sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart</code> fixes it, at least temporarily. Read through the issue on github to see the full diagnosis - as best I understand it, eth1 is not up when certificates are generated, hence the cert not valid error.</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi or any other ARM system</h3>

<p>On a Raspberry Pi: <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14184">Docker 1.7 on RaspberryPI : "socket operation on non-socket"</a> is issue 14184 on docker. The symptom is a message like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[tki@anzu ~]$ docker start redis
  Error response from daemon: Cannot start container redis: socket operation on non-socket
  Error: failed to start containers: [redis]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error flushed out a whole set of people running Docker on ARM on a variety of platforms, all having similar issues. If you're running a Scaleway C1, ODROID C1, ODROID XU3-Lite, Utilite Pro, Cubox 4x4, and all flavors of Raspberry Pi or Pi 2 you'll see this. "When using --net host the container starts" is the report, but port forwarding fails to work in that case.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu: problems with statically compiled Docker binaries</h3>

<p>The issue is <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14035">Ubuntu 15.04 vivid can not start docker 1.7.0</a>, docker issue 14035. The relevant bits of the error message are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ERRO[0000] Udev sync is not supported. This will lead to unexpected behavior, data loss and errors. For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#daemon-storage-driver-option </p>
  
  <p>ERRO[0000] [graphdriver] prior storage driver "devicemapper" failed: driver not supported </p>
  
  <p>FATA[0000] Error starting daemon: error initializing graphdriver: driver not supported </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a long discussion, culminating in <code>In the end, removing /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/ will fix the issue</code>, but people are also rolling back to 1.6.2. </p>

<h3>Ubuntu on x86: large file sizes</h3>

<p>A report that <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-1-7-0-is-using-huge-amount-of-disk-space/2046">Docker 1.7.0 is using huge amounts of disk space</a> appears on the Docker forum, item 2046. <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14204">Pulling image fills disk/image size is huge, version 1.7.0</a> is issue 14204 on Docker. Not much insight into this one yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. </p>

<p>From here I found the <a href="http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!265798!0">Reddy Kilowatt Records, 1926-1999, Archives Center, National Museum of American History.</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Reddy Kilowatt trademark was created in 1926 by Ashton B. Collins. Reddy Kilowatt, Inc. licensed the trademark promotion and identification purposes by more than 150 investor-owned electric utilities in the United States and at least 12 foreign countries. The company later changed its name to Reddy Communications, Inc. In 1998 Northern States Power Company bought Reddy Communications and its assets, later changing its name to Xcel Energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More on Ashton B. Collins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Administrative/Biographical History: Ashton B. Collins, Sr. (1885-1976), the commercial manager of Alabama Power Company, created the trademark character Reddy Kilowatt in 1926 in an attempt to humanize electric utility service for marketing and other corporate communications purposes. Reddy Kilowatt first appeared publicly at the 1926 Alabama Electrical Exposition in a display for the Alabama Power Company, which also ran supporting newspaper advertisements. The original figure had five arms to illustrate the many capabilities of electric service. Though Collins originated the idea of Reddy Kilowatt, he asked an engineer from the company’s drafting department, Dan Clinton, to create a usable sketch of the character. After the exposition, Collins retained the copyrights to Reddy Kilowatt. In 1932, he recruited a friend, Dorothea Warren, to develop several sketches of Reddy Kilowatt in an attempt to sell what Collins called “The Reddy Kilowatt Program.” At the time, Collins was employed by Edison Electrical Institute to travel the country promoting electrical household cooking appliances. He used the opportunity to network with electric utility managers and to promote his idea of using Reddy Kilowatt to humanize electric service in the home. Collins convinced his first clients in 1933. By the end of 1934, at least six other electric utility companies had adopted the “Reddy Kilowatt Program.”</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Noted as an example of "how do they do that"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.kinectrics.com/Solutions/Pages/real-time-digital-simulator-rtds.aspx">Kinetrics</a> has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. The vendor of the software is <a href="https://www.rtds.com/">RTDS Technologies</a> which describes it also thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are the pioneer and exclusive supplier of this custom hardware and software, which is specifically designed to perform real time electromagnetic transient simulations.</p>
  
  <p>The Simulator operates continuously in real time while providing accurate results over a frequency range from DC to kilohertz range. It is used for closed loop testing of protective relay and control systems, power hardware in the loop studies, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www4vip.inl.gov/research/real-time-digital-simulator/">Idaho National Laboratory has one of these simulators</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system’s graphical user interface, proprietary software and mathematical algorithms can simulate any modern electric power grid configuration. As new equipment or components are added or subtracted from the simulator’s configuration, the model instantly updates. For example, INL researchers can run simulated system–failure scenarios such as a control system cyber intrusion or a physical damage event such as a terrorist attack or natural disaster and instantly detect the order and reasoning for why dedicated relays, breakers or substations failed.</p>
  
  <p>The ability to simulate real–time power grid information is a key factor in detecting previously unknown vulnerabilities and providing emergency planners with a path forward for responding to grid failures. The RTDS Simulator enables power industry experts to define the network configuration and run real time tests for many aspects of service life allowing system problems to be discovered faster, and solutions to be designed and tested immediately.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>You might like me occasionally want to pull a bit of data from some web site and use that data in a script or process. Some modern web sites are fiendishly complex and don't have the data you want on a simple API or page that you can parse; instead, you're expected to navigate through a whole next of menus and links that present the data attractively.</p>

<p>I'm making a go of tackling this task with Selenium, a browser automation system which can drive browsers like Firefox and Chrome and that can in turn be driven by programming languages like Python.  Some notes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Download and install Firefox</a> if you don't already have it installed, from mozilla.org.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Download and install the Selenium IDE</a> for Firefox, which lets you interactively create Selenium scripts within Firefox.</p></li>
<li><p>From the command line, <code>pip install selenium</code> to get the package of Python drivers for Selenium.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're also using Google Chrome, you'll want <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/">ChromeDriver</a> to get Selenium to talk to Chrome.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With this all you have enough of the tools to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Udemy has a <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/selenium-ide-tutorial/">Selenium IDE tutorial</a> to walk through to get you started, as a prelude to their for-pay course on the same topic. Guru99 also has a <a href="http://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html">free Selenium tutorial</a> that covers the Selenium IDE. </p>

<p><a href="http://scraping.pro/selenium-ide-and-web-scraping/">A very nice overview of the process</a> from scraping.pro gives you some insight into what's really going on. The workflow is to create interactive scripts from within Firefox, then export them to Python and run them through a driver that drives multiple browsers. You can tweak lots of details in the Python script and incorporate those into some bigger applications.</p>

<p>Best bet though is to find someone who knows it and watch over their shoulder and ask questions!</p>

<p>A brief note on two pages I refer to during severe weather, like the storms that rolled through the area on Monday night and Tuesday early morning that led to <a href="https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/June_2015_Manchester_tornado">tornado damage in Manchester</a> on the morning of June 23, 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lightningmaps.org/">LightningMaps.org</a> has a zoomable near real time map of lightning strikes. You can zoom and pan around looking at locations of lightning strikes, with a small (less than 10 seconds) delay. When everything lines up right you can see the lightning strike on your computer before you hear the thunder.</p>

<p>The LightningMaps data comes from the <a href="http://www.blitzortung.org">BlitzOrtung</a> project, which has deployed a set of custom designed lightning detectors world wide. From their page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Blitzortung.org" is a lightning detection network for the location of electromagnetic discharges in the atmosphere (lightning discharges) based on the time of arrival (TOA) and time of group arrival (TOGA) method. It consists of several lightning receivers and one central processing server. The stations transmit their data in short time intervals over the Internet to our server. Every data sentence contains the precise time of arrival of the received lightning discharge impulse ("sferic") and the exact geographic position of the receiver. With this information from all stations the exact positions of the discharges are computed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blitzortung is working on a new generation of lightning detectors, which are not yet available, and they are no longer manufacturing their first generation of detectors. Even so the US coverage of lightning detection is very good and recommended for storm tracking. The project lead is Egon Wanke of Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">Using GNU Parallel to speed up network operations</a>
      </h3>
      <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough.</p>

<p>Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. If you are working on something where it doesn't matter which order things happen in as long as they all get done you are in good shape to get tremendous performance improvements simply by overlapping operations.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<p>DTE Energy does not have one single page on their web site that shows you the total number of outages across their system - or if they do have it, it's so well hidden that I haven't found it. What they do have is a way to fetch the outage count for a single ZIP code. So, armed with a set of zip codes, you can determine a total. You don't care which ZIP is fetched first but you do want them all to show up before you add them up.</p>

<p>The one-line command I have for this is</p>

<p><code>
parallel -P 32 -a ~/data/dte-zips ~/bin/dte-by-zip | jq -s add
</code></p>

<p>The script dte-by-zip runs as follows, fetching a page from a DTE server and parsing it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ dte-by-zip 48104</p>
  
  <p>38</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thus the parallel invocation reads roughly as follows: "for 32 parallel threads, using the dte-zips data file one line a time as command line arguments, run dte-by-zip; add up all the results".</p>

<p>Note that if you are using "curl" to fetch pages, you want to be aware of the <code>--max-time</code> option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-m, --max-time <seconds>
               Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to
               take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
               ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you don't want to go too crazy with parallel operations on network resources, it's possible to overrun a remote server and it might be faster to pull 8 or 16 parallel threads instead of 32 or 64 depending on the nature of the remote machine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/">runC</a>. It's a "lightweight universal plumbing" that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of Docker's start on Linux systems, it's been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. Some tries to make it work depend on setting up virtual machines (with the likes of boot2docker) which makes it work at the cost of performance and flexibility. Docker on OS X has not been exceptionally easy though it does work once you commit to doing all of your Docker server work inside a VM</p>

<p>runC would be an answer to the problem of native Docker on OSX X, one might hope, but as of its first release it doesn't work. The first of what is probably many hurdles is the extensive use of the clone(2) system call instead of fork(2). This <a href="http://files.meetup.com/10602292/See%20Docker%20from%20the%20Perspective%20of%20Linux%20Process.pdf">presentation from Allen Sun at DaoCloud</a> goes into the details of Docker's use of clone(2) from the perspective of Linux processes. It is notable that the OS X "Darwin" kernel doesn't have clone(2), and it's as far as I can tell not readily possible to mimic all of clone's semantics strictly by using fork in clever ways.</p>

<p>An open issue on Github is tracking <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/9">Build fails on Mac OS X 10.9</a>. I don't see an easy fix without work by Apple on their kernel.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I attended this week's meeting of the Governance Committee of the Ann Arbor Board of Education, and this is what I saw.</p>

<p>Two of the agenda items did not have any documents online in Board Docs before the meeting (revisions to 3000 and 4000 series policies). Those were added during the meeting.</p>

<p>One of the agenda items (cyberbullying) did have a document online. It had several typoes and missspellings, including an incorrect reference to statute.</p>

<p>A last agenda item (FOIA) had a completely incorrect document posted online, which caused measurable confusion at the meeting as trustees were reviewing a document which was not actually the one that they were asked to review. </p>

<p>I believe that these routine postings of documents from staff to the board are the responsibility of district staff, and that the board secretary is the particular person tasked with getting documents online in a timely manner. I have no idea how well Board Docs works but if it's anything like the city's Legistar system it's probably difficult to use enterprise software. Nevertheless, it's the responsibility of the board and of the executive staff to produce these records in a timely manner to prepare not just the public but <em>also the board</em> for their meetings, and this situation deserves attention to see if there's scheduling or training or other management effort to ensure that Board Docs is always up to date as a matter of good policy and practice.</p>

<p>(Also, Balas has the best welcome signs.)</p>

<p>Plus: fun to ride, big front basket. It's a very nice bike that you're riding, with a good 3 speed shifter and a very sturdy construction. </p>

<p>Minus: no lights, no bell, no helmets. More specifically, I am told that the lights come on automatically, and that there is a bell somewhere, but I didn't find it and it wasn't labelled. I did have a helmet with me so I wore that.</p>

      <p>Juneberries are ripe in Ann Arbor on June 15 - I was able to harvest a few of them on North Campus by the Duderstadt building and on Central Campus by the detours around the Engineering Arch. Get them before the birds do!</p>

      <p>Why is 410 Miller still standing, after the Building Board of Appeals issued an order for it to be demolished? In part, because the Notice and Order to demolish was never sent. From FOIA 15-210:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0840ca24970d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0840ca24970d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-11 at 7.11.33 AM" title="Screen Shot 2015-06-11 at 7.11.33 AM" src="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01bb0840ca24970d-600wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Further it is stated that the hearing at which the decision to demolish was made was recorded, yet a transcription of the hearing was not made available on account of the audio being illegible:</p>

<p>In my FOIA I neglected to ask for this transcription, not knowing that it might exist. I've filed a subsequent FOIA to figure out more, and plan to be at today's Building Board of Appeals meeting to share these findings.</p>

<p>DRAFT POLICY 5060 - STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS</p>

<p>The Board of Education believes that assessing student progress provides important data by which the district can measure the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction and the impact of our educational programs on student achievement.  Participation in assessment programs by all students ensures accurate information is provided to parents, educators and other stakeholders and is necessary to improve educational outcomes for our students.</p>

<p>Draft Amended Policy 5060</p>

<p>The Board of Education believes that assessing student progress provides important data by which the district can measure the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction and the impact of our educational programs on student achievement.  Participation in assessment programs by all students ensures accurate information is provided to parents, educators and other stakeholders and is necessary to improve educational outcomes for our students.</p>

<p>All students enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools are required to participate in any and all assessments mandated by State and Federal law.  Therefore, full participation in these required assessments is mandatory for all students who are enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools.   There is no mechanism or policy that allows for districts, or their students, to “opt out” of mandated state or federal assessments.  Failure by the district to test the required number of students in each school and/or district-wide may result in educational, financial or reporting sanctions or other negative consequences, and could lead to changes in district policies or procedures to ensure adequate and/or uniform participation.</p>

<p>The Superintendent or designee shall administer student assessments in content areas and grade levels as required by state and federal laws, and shall work with district administrators, principals and the parent and student community to ensure adequate education about and participation in state and federal mandated testing .    Failure  to participate in all state and federal assessments will result in the Board taking any additional actions deemed appropriate to protect the district. Therefore, full participation in state assessments is mandatory for all students who are enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools.  Failure to participate in all state assessments may result in exclusion and/or removal from any application-based school or program.  Special exceptions to individual student participation may be granted by the Superintendent or designee upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular updates of student progress to students, parents, educators and other stakeholders.</p>
