<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Every so often I wonder whether the weblog as a format has run its course, and
whether it might be a good idea to take some old materials offline.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the chance that a random comment I made and published in 2000 or 2005 or 2010 is
still something that I want to represent with my name to the world in 2016?</p>

<p>This editor&rsquo;s conclusion is that much too much of the format gets
published without adequate editing, and that the collection as a whole
is improved by judicious removal of mediocrity after the fact. I&rsquo;ve
unpublished about 50% of my 2016 output, and the page is somewhat
improved for the effort.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-ann-arbor-writing-escapes/">Ann Arbor quiet writing escapes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Where to go in Ann Arbor to do some quiet writing, without distractions.
There are plenty of cafes where there are lots of people around; this
list looks for the empty places where you won&rsquo;t have your attention broken
quite so easily.</p>

<p>This is a much easier task in the summer time than it is during the school
year, as the students thin out and University buildings are much quieter.</p>

<p>Central Campus:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/rackham-building/study-halls">Rackham Building reading rooms</a>, second floor. Very lovely, very quiet, recommended by many.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/hatcher-graduate-library/carrels-hatcher-graduate-library">Hatcher Graduate Library study carrels</a>, especially on the higher floors. You&rsquo;ll have a little room of your own.</li>
<li>Law Library reading room.</li>
<li>Michigan League, upper floors</li>
<li>Museum of Art</li>
<li>Palmer Commons, where the upper floors have writing desks</li>
<li>Social Work Library</li>
<li>Michigan Union first floor reading rooms</li>
</ul>

<p>Downtown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann Arbor City Hall, council chambers (not during a meeting)</li>
<li>Sweetwaters, Liberty or Washington St</li>
<li>Ann Arbor District Library, third floor (periodicals) or fourth floor (administration)</li>
<li>Zingerman&rsquo;s Next Door, upstairs in one of the smaller rooms</li>
<li>Mighty Good Coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>North side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matthaei Botanical Gardens</li>
<li>Duderstadt Center library, second floor (periodicals)</li>
</ul>

<p>South side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann Arbor Municipal Airport</li>
<li>Roos Roast</li>
</ul>

<p>Ypsilanti</p>

<ul>
<li>Cultivate in Depot Town</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, external distractions are only one part of the complex question of
&ldquo;why are no words appearing on the page&rdquo;. There are some a few tricks that I
use to minimize distractions coming from the computer itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write in a big &lsquo;vim&rsquo; window. Open up Terminal, maximize a window,
and then fire up &lsquo;vim&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m managing to get 62 lines on the screen without
having to squint, and the browser is not on the screen.</li>
<li>Go offline. If your writing environment allows, do your writing without
a connection to the Internet.</li>
<li>If you must stay online, mute notifications. On my Mac that&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;Do not disturb&rdquo; setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a big screen up another functional way to avoid a distraction
is to keep sitting until the screen is full. It&rsquo;s not necessary to
actually want to keep all of the words that you write - it&rsquo;s OK to
discard some of them in a subsequent editing session - but the self
imposed constraint to fill the page all the way to the bottom on a 62
line screen produces a substantial quantity of work in a single sitting.</p>

<p>A useful quality to cultivate is &ldquo;sitzfleisch&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Germans have aptly called Sitzfleisch the ability to spend endless hours at a desk doing grueling work. Sitzfleisch is considered by mathematicians to be a better guage of success than any of the attractive definitions of talent with which psychologists regale us from time to time.  Gian-Carlo Rota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pull up a seat, open up the screen, start typing. Don&rsquo;t look up until the page is full.
Set yourself a time limit and a word count and aim for that. The time limit can
be enforced by parking in a space where your time is limited, which reminds
me that I must be going.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-a-commonplace-reader/">A commonplace reader</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier and faster to fill a page by quoting from others.</p>

<p>The commonplace book is the annotated scrapbook, carefully collecting
bits from other writers with just enough commentary and selection to
make them your own. If these were written in this era you&rsquo;d call it
&ldquo;curation&rdquo;, though I can only think of that word in the context of
&ldquo;curated meats&rdquo;, somewhat salty and dry and meant to be preserved for
some time.</p>

<p>Anyway, the commonplace book. Why write your own words, when there are
so many other good ones already written to quote from? As it is said,
though <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/">no attribution is reliable</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Immature artists copy, great artists steal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The artist steal from tonight is Brian Eno, in particular his <a href="http://oblicard.com/">Oblique Strategies</a>,
which I now have as three lines of shell script plus 128 lines of text. A sample, intended
to be drawn at random:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not building a wall but making a brick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to brick-machines, this from Popular Science</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bricks are fairly easy to make, but in the developing world, traditional fired bricks are sometimes weak and crumble-prone, while cement ones are often unaffordable. The Vermeer BP714 is the first compressed-earth-block machine that makes strong air-dried bricks out of dirt. Its bricks don&rsquo;t just exceed U.S. cement-code strength requirements—they&rsquo;re 20 to 30 percent stronger, and cheaper than other machines&rsquo; too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s the story you want to tell when someone else
has a lot of mud and you have a lot of machine.</p>

<p>The commonplace style of writing allows you to fill a page
with text faster, since you&rsquo;re cutting and pasting it in
rather than sweating to find the exact words yourself. The
downside is that you might sometimes have to hunt for the
correct word, and it will be obvious that it&rsquo;s someone
else&rsquo;s correct word. There is no question of plagiarism,
just of assembly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The serious crimes in terms of writing are that of plagiarism and copyright violation. (Reality Studio)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So long as we are going down this route, it&rsquo;s worth rejecting
plagiarism as a thought-crime. From Kenneth Goldsmith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing: With an unprecedented amount of available text, our problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through this thicket of information—how I manage it, parse it, organize and distribute it—is what distinguishes my writing from yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make patchworks. Most two word phrases can be easily found on the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most two-word phrases are not produced under unpleasant stress, but in interest or excitement. (Penelope Leach, &ldquo;Babyhood&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The important thing is to provide the reader with enough information so that the article can be easily found on the References page. (Communication Research Methods in Postmodern Culture)</p>

<p>Lists of real-world materials and their refractive indexes are easily found on the Internet.  (Lanier, &ldquo;Maya Studio Projects Texturing and Writing&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retroactively we can construct some level of patchwork that we can crib from, in interest or excitement.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The title of the post is taken from a <a href="http://www.wired.com/1996/04/netbots/">1996 Wired article</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/koxinga21">Andrew Leonard</a>
describing the state of automated systems in the dot-com
era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Web robots – spiders, wanderers, and worms. Cancelbots, Lazarus, and Automoose. Chatterbots, softbots, userbots, taskbots, knowbots, and mailbots. MrBot and MrsBot. Warbots, clonebots, floodbots, annoybots, hackbots, and Vladbots. Gaybots, gossipbots, and gamebots. Skeleton bots, spybots, and sloth bots. Xbots and meta-bots. Eggdrop bots. Motorcycle bull dyke bots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bots are hot today in part because natural langauge processing
has improved to the point where <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html">Google can build hardware</a>
to speed up their software algorithms and run their immense
training corpuses through it quickly to fine tune their approach.
The output of this effort is ASICs that speed up their <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a>
algorithm for machine learning. Thus Google can safely give away
their software, knowing that anyone else running it will use
a multiple of the energy that it takes Google to do it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s instructive to look at the changes throughout the years and
how bots have co-evolved with the networks and computer systems
that they inhabit. Early AIs like ELIZA and PARRY lived on
mainframes connected to very slow wide-area networks, and it
was years before the two of them talked to each other online.
The 1980s and 1990s brought Usenet and the automation that could
live on store-and-forward networks. AOL Instant Messenger&rsquo;s
ubiquitous chat met popular culture and the emergence of
advertising bots like GooglyMinotaur, which promoted the music
of Radiohead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing what I think is some kind of manuscript about
bots and their personalities, a biographical dictionary of
emerging intelligences. I&rsquo;m at about 10,000 words. It&rsquo;s a challenge
to try to corral that much quasi-intelligence onto the page, including
trying as best I can to characterize some systems that are
known only by people&rsquo;s memories of them.</p>

<p>Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron,
<a href="http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2/">THE CALIFORNIAN IDEOLOGY</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If human slaves are ultimately unreliable, then mechanical ones
will have to be invented. The search for the holy grail of Artificial
Intelligence reveals this desire for the Golem a strong and loyal
slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are
made of sand. As in Asimov’s Robot novels, the techno-utopians
imagine that it is possible to obtain slave like labour from inanimate
machines. Yet, although technology can store or amplify labour, it
can never remove the necessity for humans to invent, build and
maintain these machines in the first place. Slave labour cannot be
obtained without somebody being enslaved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read this and then think about Siri, Cortana, &ldquo;Amy Ingram&rdquo; and other
long-suffering inanimate machines that we imbue so much personality
into that some of us unknowingly
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amy-ingram-personal-assistant-2015-7">flirt with a robot</a> because we are so charmed by their devotion.</p>

      <ul>
<li>Who: Wayne Eaker and the a2civictech Slack team</li>
<li>What: Restaurant inspections from Washtenaw County</li>
<li>Where: <a href="http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com">http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com</a></li>
<li>When: As they are updated, up to twice a momth</li>
<li>Why: When you eat out, you care about food safety</li>
</ul>

<p>Some example searches:</p>

<p><a href="http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/?f[0]=field_count_total%3A%5B30%20TO%201000%5D">Three restaurants with 30 or more violations</a></p>

<p>The hardest part of this project is that it&rsquo;s dependent
on an undocumented interface from the contractor who
does the work for the county.</p>

<p>One very nice aspect of the system that Wayne put together is that
you can get alerts from every time a new inspection comes out that
matches your saved settings, so you can track a particular restaurant
or problem over time.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-22-prince/">Prince</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist
passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response
any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music
responded by playing his hits - &ldquo;Little Red Corvette&rdquo;, &ldquo;Raspberry Beret&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Purple Rain&rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control
also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find.
Ann Arbor&rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.</p>

<p>The radio that I remember is from the 80s when Prince&rsquo;s music was
in regular play on the Electrifyin&rsquo; Mojo&rsquo;s show on Detroit&rsquo;s WJLB.
Prince did a very rare live radio interview with Mojo, and you can
hear it in two parts - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJZCoxZ5COY">part one</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftKtWgXzMS8">part two</a> - on Youtube.</p>

<p>What I haven&rsquo;t found yet is the computer font with a perfect Prince
symbol in it. You can get close by
<a href="http://parkerhiggins.net/2013/01/writing-the-prince-symbol-in-unicode/">writing the prince symbol in unicode</a>,
or this ASCII representation may suffice: O(+&gt; . But the
real deal came on a <a href="http://nymag.com/following/2016/04/princes-legendary-floppy-disk-symbol-font.html">3.5&rdquo; floppy disc</a> from Warner Bros.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-17-ecuador-terremoto/">Earthquake in Ecuador, April 16, 2016</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, MI, 17 April 2016: An earthquake hit near the coast of
Ecuador on the evening of 16 April 2016. As of 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time the current estimate is 235 killed and 1,557 wounded from the
incident. Reports are still coming in from the hardest hit areas
which lost telecommunications lines in the disaster, so expect these
numbers to increase.</p>

<p>Early reports from Ecuador came in
<a href="https://twitter.com/abenavidesgol/status/721506479866572800">primarily via social media</a>, as it took
a while for the nation&rsquo;s news organization to cut over to flash reporting
of the news from their regularly scheduled programs. The country&rsquo;s
vice president, <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeGlas">Jorge Glas</a>, provided
regular and authoritative reports on damage and emergency response.</p>

<p>Reporting on the damage was almost entirely in Spanish,
as there is no substantial English language media presence in the
county. I found the automated translation service provided by Bing
in the Twitter feed to be indispensible. Some words that you will
see over and over again:</p>

<ul>
<li>personas heridas = people injured</li>
<li>personas fallecidas = people killed</li>
<li>sin luz = without electricity</li>
<li>sismo, terremoto, temblor = earthquake</li>
</ul>

<p>For music and (sometimes) news from Ecuador, I turned to Tunein, which
relays thousands of radio stations worldwide. At various times the following
channels were interesting or informative:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Am%C3%A9rica-Estereo-%40Guayaquil%41-933-s68608/">Radio America Estereo, Guayaquil</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Quito-760-s59649/">Radio Quito, 760 AM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Ecuador-Inmediato-Radio-s59648/">Ecuador Inmediato Radio, Quito</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I looked for the shortwave broadcast of <a href="http://radiohcjb.org/">HCJB</a> but
it would appear that its English language broadcasts are no more. There is
news in Spanish on the site under the <a href="http://radiohcjb.org/author/noticias/">Noticias</a> banner.</p>

<p>Some individual news feeds to follow from the time of the event:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/lewisshepherd">Lewis Shepherd</a>, Washington DC based analyst</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/elcomerciocom">El Comercio</a>, Quito newspaper</li>

<li><a href="http://twitter.com/IGEcuador">IG Ecuador</a>, Instituto Geofísico with quake maps and scientific reports</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts go out to everyone affected by the quake.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m working through the details of an upgrade from Mavericks to
El Capitan. Some running notes.</p>

<p>The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood
in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster
than my home UVerse.</p>

<p>After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is <code>brew update</code>. You
would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed,
and that brew is working hard to update everything.</p>

<p>The biggest reason that I upgraded was to get <code>xhyve</code> and thus
Docker for Mac. I&rsquo;m using the beta now (beta 5) and have gotten
a few trivial things to work, but am still sorting out a few
questions which might or might not be issues.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The bids for the work came in higher than expected, so the
City of Ann Arbor&rsquo;s Ann Arbor Stadium Boulevard road
reconstruction project will likely omit the section between Main Street and Seventh.
That&rsquo;s the word from the city&rsquo;s engineer on the project, Michael Nearing, P.E.
He writes in an email sent from his iPhone on Saturday, Feb 13, 2016 at 1:26 PM:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point it appears that the only realistic option to perform the project with the funds that are available is to revise the project limits.  We are currently reviewing the plans, the planned work, our material choices, proposed construction methods, and the bid prices received to determine the most prudent course of action.</p>

<p>Once we better understand all the factors that will affect the work, we&rsquo;ll share the information with Council and the public of our revised course of action.</p>

<p>We are hopeful the we can re-bid the project later this year and start construction after the U of M Home Football season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Details on the city&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/departments/engineering/Pages/Stadium-Blvd-Road-Reconstruction-Project.aspx">Stadium Boulevard Road Reconstruction Project</a> page do not yet reflect this new reality, and the

      <p>Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry">chicken and onion curry</a>
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.</p>

<p>We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
<a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431">daikon raita</a> from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.</p>

<p>The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 25 2016: The Ann Arbor Public Schools
issued this news release and letter to parents, signed by Superintendent
Jeanice Swift.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Monday, January 25, 2016</p>

<p>Dear AAPS Parents,</p>

<p>As many of you may have already heard, there have been threats made on social media to multiple school districts across the metro area, extending to Florida, and rumored to have occurred as far as California.</p>

<p>Please be assured that in the Ann Arbor Public Schools, we take any and all threats very seriously and consistently follow established emergency procedures in cooperation with Ann Arbor Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>We received information in the early morning hours that Ann Arbor was included in this social media situation.  Police were notified immediately and we have been actively working with the AAPD since first learning of this issue.</p>

<p>Our principals were advised early this morning of this situation, and we continue to work with law enforcement officials as part of our safety protocol. We will continue to monitor this situation very closely.</p>

<p>As the use of social media for posting threats against schools seems to be increasing, I would like to ask all parents to talk to their children about using social media and instruct them that if they see anything on social media that is a concern, to immediately report it to an adult, such as a parent, principal or teacher.  If they re-post or pass on the threat, they can also be held responsible for issuing a threat and can receive disciplinary action as a result.</p>

<p>Please be assured that we take every threat seriously as safety for our students and staff is our first priority.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jeanice K. Swift, Ph.D.
Superintendent of Schools</p>

      </h3>
      <p>APRS is the &ldquo;Automatic Position Reporting Service&rdquo;, a
system for sharing information about the position of
participating amateur radio stations. Clients transmit
position reports on 144.39 Mhz; digipeaters repeat
these reports to other monitoring stations; and various
IGate sites monitor transmissions and send their findings
to <a href="http://aprs.fi">aprs.fi</a> which collects worldwide data.</p>

<p>In recent memory there has been an APRS digipeater in
Chelsea, Michigan with wide area coverage, good enough
to pick up travellers on I-94 west of Ann Arbor.
The Chelsea digirepeater is currently off the air,
which leaves a coverage gap.</p>

<p>There is one station within the city of Ann Arbor.
<a href="http://aprs.fi/info/a/KD8TDF">KD8TDF</a> is in southeast
Ann Arbor (EN82dg). Its coverage is enough to pick up
part of I-94 right adjacent to town. A second station,
<a href="http://aprs.fi/info/a/AB3DC-1">AB3DC-1</a> is the
Ann Arbor/Ypsi Rx-iGate, w8pgw.org, right near St.
Joe&rsquo;s Hospital (EN82eg).</p>

<p>Discussion at last night&rsquo;s ARROW meeting included a
desire to experiment on 2 meters with digital modes.
Dave New <a href="http://www.qrz.com/DB/N8SBE">N8SBE</a> talked
about software defined radio and GNU Radio, and demonstrated
monitoring car key-fobs on UHF.</p>

<p>APRS is a very old and useful digital mode, and I
am hopeful that local network conditions will improve.</p>

      <p>The Ann Arbor Building Board of Appeals will not meet today, January
13, 2016, for lack of a quorum.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know the following to help understand more about this group:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is on the board, and how long have they been on it?</li>
<li>Have there been any recent changes to board membership?</li>
<li>Who is eligible to be appointed to the board, and what does that process entail?</li>
<li>What happens to decisions that the board needs to make if a quorum cannot be met?</li>
<li>What is the status of the search for a full-time building official?</li>
<li>When does the board next anticipate meeting with a quorum?</li>
<li>Who has been nominated to serve on this board?</li>
<li>Why did the board not make quorum?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=452565&amp;GUID=F55A2A53-26AB-404B-9A59-8A9FCD92EE39&amp;Options=info&amp;Search=">agenda for the meeting</a> has been
posted, which gives you an idea of what is not being done:</p>

<ul>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 325 W Liberty</li>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 215 N Maple<br /></li>
<li>BBA Variance Application for 121 W Kingsley</li>
<li>BBA Show Cause Hearing for 2001 Commerce</li>
<li>BBA Show Cause Hearing for 111 S Main St</li>
</ul>

<p>The last of these, 111 S Main St, is a building on the city&rsquo;s
Dangerous Buildings list right on Main Street. The building
has a tree growing out of the roof, spongy floors due to water
infiltration, and mold everywhere according to the building
inspector&rsquo;s report. The unavailability of the Building Board
means that the owner of 111 S Main doesn&rsquo;t have to face a
public hearing for another month.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor City Hall, January 8, 2016 - A brief report from a jammed
Council committee meeting held in the council workroom. The committee
moved public comment time to the begining of the meeting to hear
concerns of citizens who objected to a previous decision of the committee,
memorialized as follows on Legistar as 15-1179 enacted on October 16, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resolution to Approve a Request from Aquamarine Springs, LLC for a New Micro-Brewer, Small Wine-Maker, Small Distiller Liquor License and Dance/Entertainment Permit, to be Located at 507 S. Ashley Street Sponsors: Council Liquor License Review Committee</p>

<p>The committee noted that the building is located in the floodway and is also part of the Old West Side Historic District. Committee members discussed the fact that any renovation to the building would require further review by the Fire and Building Departments and may also require site plan approval. It was noted that this approval was only for the applicant to proceed with the liquor license application process.</p>

<p>A motion was made by Councilmember Kailasapathy, seconded by Councilmember Lumm, that the Resolution be recommended for approval to the City Council on 10/19/2015. On a voice vote, the Chair declared the motion carried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizens at the meeting objected to this decision, both
that they were not properly informed of the decision making

nearby that should have the right to object to the decision.
Several people at this meeting had gone to Lansing to register their
complaints.</p>

<p>Also on the docket was a proposal from Glass House Brewing LLC for
a &ldquo;New Micro-Brewer Liquor License to be Located at 2350 W. Liberty

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-01-08-oxford-flood-network/">Oxford Flood Network</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The Oxford Flood Network is making a flood detection network in
the UK, using low cost sensors and volunteers. They are sharing
their <a href="https://github.com/oxfloodnet">code on Github</a> and their
results on the <a href="https://twitter.com/flood_network">Flood_Network</a>
Twitter account.</p>

<p>They encourage you to <a href="http://flood.network/join">join their effort</a>,
and no high technology is necessary. The network incorporates
both readings from automated sensors (about £250) as well as
manual readings from gaugeboards or photos.</p>

<p>New as of December 2015 is an <a href="http://www.nominet.uk/iot-technology-powers-an-interactive-flood-map-and-sensor-network/">interactive flood map</a>.
A post from Nominet describes the effort:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nominet, in association with the Flood Network, is today launching an interactive, online map which visualises river and stream levels around Oxford. The map, showing how technology can be a part of flood defence systems anywhere, has been developed following a successful pilot project with the Oxford Flood Network. The project has been focused on exploring the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an extensive, localised, early-warning system for flood-prone areas for the first time in the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system is using TVWS (&ldquo;TV white space&rdquo;) as its wide area backhaul
network for these sensors for hard-to-reach devices that are outside
of the range of wifi. Cost-effective and reliable access to remote
small sensors is one of the tough spots in Internet of Things development,
it&rsquo;s interesting to see TVWS as a possible solution to this issue.
The other relevant technology for low-cost metro area networks for
sensors is Lorawan, more about which later.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-22-kale-into-ice-cream/">How I turned 99 cents worth of kale into half a gallon of delicious ice cream</a>
      </h3>
      <p>&ldquo;Learn this one weird trick&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grocery stores hate him&rdquo;</p>

<p>Really though it&rsquo;s pretty simple. Lucky&rsquo;s had a sale on kale for
99 cents, so I bought one bunch. The clerk rang it up at $2.49, and
when I asked, they said it was organic. I figured I had pulled it
from the wrong bin, whatever.</p>

<p>Get home, cook the kale (it&rsquo;s delicious; recipe below). Check the
twist tie to check my mistake, and find out that the kale wasn&rsquo;t
actually organic, and that I was overcharged.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the &ldquo;Lucky&rsquo;s overcharges&rdquo; before on our neighborhood
email list, where it comes up from time to time., I didn&rsquo;t
have to quote chapter and verse of state law, just mention the
Michigan scan law. The manager hand wrote a receipt and gave me
$5.00 cash as well as refunding the purchase price of the kale on
my card.</p>

<p>Fortunately I didn&rsquo;t have to buy any more kale. Chocolate ice cream
was $4.99 per half gallon, and it too was delicious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Save your receipts, at least until the meal is eaten.</li>
<li>Check the twist-ties on your produce to make sure you got what you were charged for.</li>
<li>Organic produce PLU numbers are 5 digits starting with a 9.</li>
<li>Lucky&rsquo;s was friendly when I pointed out their error, no hassle at all.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>Sauteed kale</p>

<ul>
<li>1 bunch kale (organic preferred)</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1 clove garlic</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the oil until it shimmers. Slice the garlic into slices and
cook until fragrant but not yet browned.</p>

<p>Wash the kale and trim the stems . Chop the leaves finely. Add to
hot pan and stir until the kale has wilted somewhat and has changed
color.</p>

<p>Add about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup of water to the pan, then cover quickly. Steam
the kale until cooked to taste.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Previously: <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) Fifth Anniversary</a></p>

<p>I had a chance to spend some time at the U of Michigan
<a href="http://guides.lib.umich.edu/cvga">Computer and Video Game Archive</a>
tonight, with J in tow (or perhaps I was in tow).
We played for about two hours in total, and then adjourned
for dinner to talk about new and classic gaming and game emulation.
He snuck in a few games of Tetris on his phone afterwards.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few game reviews and observations.</p>

<p>The first game I turn to at the UMCVGA is an arcade version of
Centipede. The archive has an <a href="http://www.arcadelegends.com/">Arcade Legends</a>
cabinet that has real arcade controls, and then emulated games
running on some kind of Linux system running MAME inside.
&ldquo;Legendary arcade games authentic in every detail&rdquo; says the pitch,
and the game comes with the crucial trackball that makes the
arcade version of Centipede a singular experience.</p>

<p>As an Atari game, Centipede is also available on other systems, and
I looked at it on the Atari 2600, running on original hardware
including a vintage analog television set for the display. Centipede
is not very complex, and the 2600 version is faithful to the original
gameplay for the most part. The graphics are as flickery as I had
ever remembered, especially when you hit your target.</p>

<p>A reasonable life goal is to play Centipede on as many systems as
the Archive supports. The Mirlyn catalog currently suggests
that there are <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?type%5B%5D=all&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=centipede%20game&amp;filter%5B%5D=format%3AVideo%20Games">eight versions of Centipede</a> available, on platforms including
Sega Dreamcast,
the TI-99,
Atari 2600,
Sega Genesis,
Playstation Portable (PSP),
Windows 95 / 98,
Playstation, and
Windows XP.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing on the Nintendo 3DS was new to me, though I had
heard <a href="https://twitter.com/chairckicker">Brian Kerr</a> talk about it
for quite some time. Animal Crossing is really fun in a quirky little
way that a social casual game that&rsquo;s age-appropriate for seven year
olds can be. I didn&rsquo;t get very far into the game, but it was clear
that every character in the game that interacted with me was super
happy to see me back in the system, and that kind of welcoming
reunion greeting was something I want to emulate myself.</p>

<p>A recent (January 2015) interview with David Carter (superman) on PRX
was a good 17 minute listen about the current state of the archive.</p>

<p>On PRX: <a href="https://beta.prx.org/stories/141395">Six Years Inside the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive with David Carter</a> from Radio Free Culture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Carter of the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive at University of
Michigan tells us about the collection, how it&rsquo;s used in an academic
setting, and a little about the care and feeding of elderly video
game consoles.</p>

<p>I have a next visit already scheduled for January.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-17-iot-platforms/">Platforms for the Internet of Things, 2015 edition</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question
of &ldquo;platform&rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer
IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes
in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt,
it&rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for
2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.</p>

<p>This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar
systems are next to each other. It&rsquo;s a highly dimensional space, but
all elements have something in common: engineers are trying to
change how we interact with simple devices like light bulbs through
our hand-held phones, and no one has the full correct answer that&rsquo;s
obviously right. Indeed it&rsquo;s not clear at all that there is
a right answer for some of these controls; the
<a href="http://twitter.com/internetofshit">Internet of Shit twitter account</a>
collects with some glee the number of devices that emphatically should
not be on the Internet.</p>

<p>On to the platforms:</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em> is hard to ignore. Many smaller cloud platforms are
built on top of its AWS computing platforms, and Amazon has
entered the fray with its AWS IoT service that offers a hosted
MQTT message server. In addition Amazon has the Echo product
that does voice recognition. Nearly impossible to ignore, Amazon
is a clear central player in the IoT consumer space.</p>

<p><em>Google</em> is a distant second in the IoT world, mostly because
the Google Compute Engine isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a compute
platform, and the Android phone isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a top
end phone. Google does have the moxie to make it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Internet Thing&rdquo;
be a self-driving car. The Nest thermostat is the most obvious
home point-of-entry for Google, and the platform and brand extension
to watch is more stuff that works with Nest.</p>

<p><em>Apple</em> has the phone to want, and the assistant (Siri) that people
have learned how to talk to to get things done. If the Internet of
Things is going to be controlled from an app, it&rsquo;s an app that&rsquo;s going
to run on an Apple phone, and you&rsquo;re going to be able to talk to it.
Less clear is Apple&rsquo;s in-home device hub strategy - the AppleTV never
really has had that open platform feel to attract the first-mover developer.</p>

<p><em>Microsoft</em> would dearly love to play in this world, but Windows 10
on ARM and the Raspberry Pi is a disappointment, and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is mostly
defined by problems too big for Excel. The Microsoft cloud platform,
Azure, mostly seems to be used by organizations that treat it as
a second or third data center, or who are locked in to Azure for
business and partnership reasons. Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana is capable, but
hardly anyone has Windows phones to talk with.</p>

<p><em>IBM</em> is the wild card here. Their Bluemix hosted platform service is
interesting if unusual and not really aimed at the consumer space. A
very interesting Node-RED project has extended IBM influence into
the Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth BLE sensor space, but it feels like
an interesting technology play and not a product.</p>

<p>Next, to major players with hardware. &ldquo;How many engineers does it
take to change a lightbulb?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Philips</em> has the Hue line of home products, mostly lighting focused.
There was a hue and cry about the Philips decision to disable support
for some compatible products that did not have explicit partnership
agreements in place, and the nature of the complaining made it clear
that there&rsquo;s an active hobbyist community around this product space.</p>

<p><em>Flex</em> is the new player, with its recent acquisition of the
assets of Wink from the bankruptcy of Quirky.  Flex, formerly known
as Flextronics, is a large contract manufacturer, and it knows how
to build quite a few things; look for Wink&rsquo;s technology to make its
way into a wider range of products.</p>

<p><em>Samsung</em> and their SmartThings brand has enough market share to make
interesting efforts, but again to that point there&rsquo;s no one breakout
product in their portfolio that brings that brand much to mind unless
you are using it.</p>

<p>Finally -</p>

<p>The biggest winner in the IoT space for this year and probably for
next year is an Internet tool with the unlikely name of <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
&ldquo;If this, then that&rdquo; is the level of control you get with IFTTT,
and surprisingly enough that&rsquo;s enough to do all sorts of things -
mostly because IFTTT speaks just enough of the protocols of over 100
systems that you can glue together a recipe that does something
when something else happens even when the two vendors you are dealing
with have never heard of each other.</p>

<p>Interoperability is the bugaboo of Internet of Things systems development.
Many vendors want you to sign up to their big bear hug of a partnership
agreement and work solely within their ecosystem. Others have narrow
APIs and proprietary protocols that discourage casual reuse. Where
IFTTT fits in is as a universal connector kit that lets you explore
how parts fit together.  The IFTTT
<a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/collections/32-recipes-for-the-internet-of-things">recipes for the Internet of Things</a> captures some of the essence of what
can be done right now without much of a fuss if you have wide protocol
support, even if it&rsquo;s only very simple support.
Many vendors in the &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;
space could benefit from thorough understanding of simple connectivity.</p>
