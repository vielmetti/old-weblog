<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      </h3>
      <p>Previously: <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/">University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) Fifth Anniversary</a></p>

<p>I had a chance to spend some time at the U of Michigan
<a href="http://guides.lib.umich.edu/cvga">Computer and Video Game Archive</a>
tonight, with J in tow (or perhaps I was in tow).
We played for about two hours in total, and then adjourned
for dinner to talk about new and classic gaming and game emulation.
He snuck in a few games of Tetris on his phone afterwards.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a few game reviews and observations.</p>

<p>The first game I turn to at the UMCVGA is an arcade version of
Centipede. The archive has an <a href="http://www.arcadelegends.com/">Arcade Legends</a>
cabinet that has real arcade controls, and then emulated games
running on some kind of Linux system running MAME inside.
&ldquo;Legendary arcade games authentic in every detail&rdquo; says the pitch,
and the game comes with the crucial trackball that makes the
arcade version of Centipede a singular experience.</p>

<p>As an Atari game, Centipede is also available on other systems, and
I looked at it on the Atari 2600, running on original hardware
including a vintage analog television set for the display. Centipede
is not very complex, and the 2600 version is faithful to the original
gameplay for the most part. The graphics are as flickery as I had
ever remembered, especially when you hit your target.</p>

<p>A reasonable life goal is to play Centipede on as many systems as
the Archive supports. The Mirlyn catalog currently suggests
that there are <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?type%5B%5D=all&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=centipede%20game&amp;filter%5B%5D=format%3AVideo%20Games">eight versions of Centipede</a> available, on platforms including
Sega Dreamcast,
the TI-99,
Atari 2600,
Sega Genesis,
Playstation Portable (PSP),
Windows 95 / 98,
Playstation, and
Windows XP.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing on the Nintendo 3DS was new to me, though I had
heard <a href="https://twitter.com/chairckicker">Brian Kerr</a> talk about it
for quite some time. Animal Crossing is really fun in a quirky little
way that a social casual game that&rsquo;s age-appropriate for seven year
olds can be. I didn&rsquo;t get very far into the game, but it was clear
that every character in the game that interacted with me was super
happy to see me back in the system, and that kind of welcoming
reunion greeting was something I want to emulate myself.</p>

<p>A recent (January 2015) interview with David Carter (superman) on PRX
was a good 17 minute listen about the current state of the archive.</p>

<p>On PRX: <a href="https://beta.prx.org/stories/141395">Six Years Inside the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive with David Carter</a> from Radio Free Culture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>David Carter of the Computer &amp; Video Game Archive at University of
Michigan tells us about the collection, how it&rsquo;s used in an academic
setting, and a little about the care and feeding of elderly video
game consoles.</p>

<p>I have a next visit already scheduled for January.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-17-iot-platforms/">Platforms for the Internet of Things, 2015 edition</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A discussion on one of the lists I follow covers the question
of &ldquo;platform&rdquo; support for the Internet of Things. Since consumer
IoT is a kind of squooshy market right now with rapid changes
in prices and no one obvious choice for what technology to adopt,
it&rsquo;s worthwhile taking some kind of review of the landscape for
2015 and sort out what to watch for next year.</p>

<p>This is organized by vendor, and loosely grouped so that similar
systems are next to each other. It&rsquo;s a highly dimensional space, but
all elements have something in common: engineers are trying to
change how we interact with simple devices like light bulbs through
our hand-held phones, and no one has the full correct answer that&rsquo;s
obviously right. Indeed it&rsquo;s not clear at all that there is
a right answer for some of these controls; the
<a href="http://twitter.com/internetofshit">Internet of Shit twitter account</a>
collects with some glee the number of devices that emphatically should
not be on the Internet.</p>

<p>On to the platforms:</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em> is hard to ignore. Many smaller cloud platforms are
built on top of its AWS computing platforms, and Amazon has
entered the fray with its AWS IoT service that offers a hosted
MQTT message server. In addition Amazon has the Echo product
that does voice recognition. Nearly impossible to ignore, Amazon
is a clear central player in the IoT consumer space.</p>

<p><em>Google</em> is a distant second in the IoT world, mostly because
the Google Compute Engine isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a compute
platform, and the Android phone isn&rsquo;t the first choice for a top
end phone. Google does have the moxie to make it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Internet Thing&rdquo;
be a self-driving car. The Nest thermostat is the most obvious
home point-of-entry for Google, and the platform and brand extension
to watch is more stuff that works with Nest.</p>

<p><em>Apple</em> has the phone to want, and the assistant (Siri) that people
have learned how to talk to to get things done. If the Internet of
Things is going to be controlled from an app, it&rsquo;s an app that&rsquo;s going
to run on an Apple phone, and you&rsquo;re going to be able to talk to it.
Less clear is Apple&rsquo;s in-home device hub strategy - the AppleTV never
really has had that open platform feel to attract the first-mover developer.</p>

<p><em>Microsoft</em> would dearly love to play in this world, but Windows 10
on ARM and the Raspberry Pi is a disappointment, and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; is mostly
defined by problems too big for Excel. The Microsoft cloud platform,
Azure, mostly seems to be used by organizations that treat it as
a second or third data center, or who are locked in to Azure for
business and partnership reasons. Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana is capable, but
hardly anyone has Windows phones to talk with.</p>

<p><em>IBM</em> is the wild card here. Their Bluemix hosted platform service is
interesting if unusual and not really aimed at the consumer space. A
very interesting Node-RED project has extended IBM influence into
the Raspberry Pi and Bluetooth BLE sensor space, but it feels like
an interesting technology play and not a product.</p>

<p>Next, to major players with hardware. &ldquo;How many engineers does it
take to change a lightbulb?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Philips</em> has the Hue line of home products, mostly lighting focused.
There was a hue and cry about the Philips decision to disable support
for some compatible products that did not have explicit partnership
agreements in place, and the nature of the complaining made it clear
that there&rsquo;s an active hobbyist community around this product space.</p>

<p><em>Flex</em> is the new player, with its recent acquisition of the
assets of Wink from the bankruptcy of Quirky.  Flex, formerly known
as Flextronics, is a large contract manufacturer, and it knows how
to build quite a few things; look for Wink&rsquo;s technology to make its
way into a wider range of products.</p>

<p><em>Samsung</em> and their SmartThings brand has enough market share to make
interesting efforts, but again to that point there&rsquo;s no one breakout
product in their portfolio that brings that brand much to mind unless
you are using it.</p>

<p>Finally -</p>

<p>The biggest winner in the IoT space for this year and probably for
next year is an Internet tool with the unlikely name of <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
&ldquo;If this, then that&rdquo; is the level of control you get with IFTTT,
and surprisingly enough that&rsquo;s enough to do all sorts of things -
mostly because IFTTT speaks just enough of the protocols of over 100
systems that you can glue together a recipe that does something
when something else happens even when the two vendors you are dealing
with have never heard of each other.</p>

<p>Interoperability is the bugaboo of Internet of Things systems development.
Many vendors want you to sign up to their big bear hug of a partnership
agreement and work solely within their ecosystem. Others have narrow
APIs and proprietary protocols that discourage casual reuse. Where
IFTTT fits in is as a universal connector kit that lets you explore
how parts fit together.  The IFTTT
<a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/collections/32-recipes-for-the-internet-of-things">recipes for the Internet of Things</a> captures some of the essence of what
can be done right now without much of a fuss if you have wide protocol
support, even if it&rsquo;s only very simple support.
Many vendors in the &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo;
space could benefit from thorough understanding of simple connectivity.</p>

<p>Also previously: <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/">Split tunnels considered harmful</a></p>

<p>I have this running in a staging environment and a test
environment; it properly isolates OpenVPN from the underlying
operating system, and seems to do the right thing performing
rather well. However, its biggest limitation is that
it runs on a single host &amp; thus provides neither
high availability in the case of Amazon <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-20-aws-dynamodb-downtime-sunday-am/">funkiness</a>
nor scalability to handle lots of clients.</p>

<p>Getting this to be more reliable was a matter of tracking
down the right systemd configuration. I&rsquo;ll save systemd
commentary for a separate post, saying only that it&rsquo;s new,
it&rsquo;s not necessarily better for managing single machines,
but I can see the advantages for consolidated management of
big collections of machines.</p>

<p>Some OpenVPN config alternatives to pursue that look like they might do
the right thing are as follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cloudcoreo.com">CloudCoreo</a> has a setup based on the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.
They say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting an OpenVPN config up and running in AWS is difficult. We&rsquo;ve already done it for you in an HA, durable, self-healing way. This blog post details how.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blog post is in two sections.
<a href="http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn/">Part one</a> details how they
configured autoscaling, elastic load balancing, name service, S3
storage and policies, and security and IAM policies to set things
up the way that you would want them within Amazon&rsquo;s AWS.
<a href="http://blog.cloudcoreo.com/single-points-of-failure-openvpn-part-2-of-2/">Part two</a> goes on to describe the particular OpenVPN policy
and routing setup, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of policy there particularly
with the use of split tunnels that you want to understand.</p>

<p>Their claim that they have
&ldquo;done it all for you&rdquo; reflects a <a href="http://hub.cloudcoreo.com/stack/servers-vpn_c6a65">complete configuration</a> available
through their CloudCoreo system.</p>

<p>A second approach is detailed by <a href="https://blog.zalando.com">Zalando</a>, a Berlin based retail fashion platform.
Their article <a href="https://tech.zalando.com/blog/building-an-openvpn-cluster-zalando-style/">Building an OpenVPN Cluster, Zalando-Style</a>
uses dynamic routing to distribute routes, and the
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/">Quagga</a> system as their software based router. This setup
does not particularly depend on AWS features, and they
claim that
&ldquo;With this set up, we have about 800 users (150 in parallel) and haven’t faced any performance issues at anytime, from anywhere!&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s a bit more complex to set up, though the writeup
makes it clear that because of the flexibility that dynamic
routing gives you there&rsquo;s the opportunity to construct
firewall policies that follow the user quite independent
of how they are connecting to the network.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system. (John Gall, Systemantics)</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Twitter is, of course, for telling people that you are eating a sandwich.
That&rsquo;s been the point of the system the whole time - long before selfies,
even long before it took pictures at all, you might get a proper narrative
of what people are eating for lunch or a snack.</p>

<p>Using the net to keep track of food is an old tradition; I need
only point you at the <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/main.html">Usenet Cookbook</a>,
developed from 1985 to 1987 by Brian Reid, as an archetype.
&ldquo;I had a lettuce and tomato sandwich Saturday with mustard instead of mayonnaise. Better than I would have feared.&rdquo; But that collection is
weak on sandwiches, lending itself more to
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/etexts/recept/us/SP-menu.html">soups</a>.</p>

<p>To remedy this need I have started a small and pitiful but
hopefully growable sandwich recipe collection, using Github
as the hosting place of choice. See
<a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich">the vielmetti/sandwich repository</a>
for the first start. As it happens, I am clearly not the only person
to think this way; herewith some collection of sandwich collections.</p>

<p>Barrie Turner (@bazbt3) came up with roughly the same idea at the same
time, and you might see his <a href="http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2015/12/10/git-sandwiches/">git sandwiches</a> blog for the proper inspiration for collection
development. Thanks to @ellemef for connecting us.</p>

<p>Single sandwiches in git include</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnus919/grilledcheese">grilled cheese</a>, from Magnus Hedemark</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pcon/recipes/tree/master/meals/fried_chicken_sandwich">gluten free fried chicken sandwich</a> from Patrick Connelly</li>
</ul>

<p>and certainly many more.</p>

<p>If you are ill-equipped in your kitchen
to make your own sandwiches, this command line tool will
<a href="https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js">order you a sandwich from Jimmy John&rsquo;s</a>. It comes with a makefile so that you invoke it as
<code>sudo make me a sandwich</code> and it will do the right thing.</p>

The topic of the conversation was roughly &ldquo;places to take a walk
outside in the winter&rdquo;, and the dog-owners among us amended to include
&ldquo;with a dog&rdquo;, and we got a pretty good list that I want to get
onto Arborwiki.</p>

<p>As always the Arborwiki <a href="http://arborwiki.org/Birthday_Deals">birthday deals</a>
page came through, and I scored freebies or discounts at
Northside Grill (breakfast sandwich), Roos Roast (mocha),
Zingerman&rsquo;s Bakery (bread) and Zingerman&rsquo;s Coffee (coffee).</p>

<p>The technical commentary of the year is that Twitter has an
opportunity to step up its birthday game, and it would seem
that that&rsquo;s a chance to do things right (or do things differently
from Facebook, at least).</p>

<p>Until the next time around the sun!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been frustrated in the past at the slow pace of getting meeting minutes
through Freedom of Information Act requests. Queries to the City of Ann Arbor
routinely get the full round of routine delays, with several cases where I&rsquo;ve
had to wait 15 business days to get routine meeting minutes.</p>

<p>As it happens, there&rsquo;s an alternative to asking for minutes, using the
Michigan Open Meetings Act directly as your guide. Here&rsquo;s a recent request
that gave me same-day results:</p>

<pre><code>Hello, this is a request under the Michigan Open Meetings Act.

Please make available for inspection the draft minutes of the (named)
Committee meeting of today, December 8, 2015.

Under the terms of the Act, draft minutes are to be made available
for inspection within 8 business days of the date of the meeting,
or by my calendar December 18, 2015.

(Name) is listed as the staff contact for this board.

Thank you for your cooperation.
</code></pre>

<p>The request was routed to the staff member, and the minutes were prepared
and ready and shared with me the same day that the meeting was held.
Same day service!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-12-04-split-tunnels-considered-harmful/">Split tunnels considered harmful</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Previously: <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/comment/chech.html">Considered harmful essays considered harmful</a>, Eric Meyer, 2002; also Go To Statement Considered Harmful, CACM, 1968; also <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/">Encyclopedia of things considered harmful</a>, from cat-v.org.</p>

<p>Split tunnels are a VPN construction where instead of
sending all of your traffic for the network in a single
encrypted tunnel that collects everything, you instead
route some traffic down the encrypted link and other traffic
goes in the clear through your default connection. It&rsquo;s
possible that you might have a tunnel configuration with
multiple splits if e.g. you needed to get to private
address space at two or more organizations simultaneously.</p>

<p>If you have a choice, don&rsquo;t use a split tunnel. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>First and foremost are security considerations. The user of
the split tunnel introduces a possible forwarding path between
the outside Internet world (full of nefarious intent) and
the inside Internet world that you have a secure path to and
its chewy center. If an attacker knows that you are using a
split tunnel, they can put something on the public Internet
that causes you to send their traffic directly through to your private
network while you have all your trust relationships intact.
This could be bad, and if your security instincts trend towards
professional paranoia, you&rsquo;ll understand that there&rsquo;s a real risk.</p>

<p>A second security consideration is unplanned leakage of private
information into the Internet. The split tunnel in its ordinary
configuration expects that you can distinguish protected traffic
from unprotected traffic by its IP address. The nature of
the modern Internet is that a browser can and will connect to
dozens or hundreds of hosts on its way to filling out a web page,
and any one of those connections might expose or leak some
information about what you were doing on the &ldquo;private&rdquo; link
that could be of use to an adversary or snoop.</p>

<p>Finally, split tunnels are difficult to verify as correctly
configured. The managed endpoint of the tunnel can only see
traffic destined for it, and can only verify that what&rsquo;s
there is going to the endpoint. With a split, the managed
endpoint doesn&rsquo;t have visibility into all traffic destinations
and thus is completely unaware of any exfiltration attempts.</p>

<p>However, there may be reasons that a split tunnel is unavoidable.
Here are some considerations to balance against the risk.</p>

<p>A split tunnel is more versatile than a full tunnel. If your
users need to connect to more than one administrative domain
simultaenously, they may need to configure their local host
setup to have two or more split tunnels running at once.</p>

<p>If the tunnel endpoint is at the long end of a slow connection,
or if the trusted managed endpoint is bandwidth or CPU constrained,
performance through a full tunnel may be unacceptably bad.
Splitting the tunnel means that only necessary traffic goes through
it, allowing better use of network resources.</p>

<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the cost. If the user is going to be a typical
Internet use and do simultaneous Spotify or Netflix or other
streaming media, it seems insane to pay VPN charges or engineer
your own VPN endpoint to handle that full stream of data when it
could very easily go over a lowest-cost unencrypted link.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I have been using Github issues for a long time as a todo list
tracking and general productivity tool. It works well enough that
I&rsquo;ve opened over 4000 issues and have closed most of them.</p>

<p>The perpetual management challenge is in deciding how many issues
is OK to leave open. Put too few in, and it feels like you have
things to do that are not written down; put in too many, and you&rsquo;re
likely to have duplication and you forget what it is that you were
trying to do in the first place.</p>

<p>The best part of the challenge is having some illusion of
control over what is going on. I&rsquo;m trying to work the queue
this way. Some times my goal will be to create more open issues,
putting things on the list to increase it up to a target goal.
Other times the goal will be to reduce the size of the list by
finishing tasks, clearing duplicates, or deciding not to get things
done. By framing it as a deliberate game of &ldquo;add tasks up to a
target&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear tasks down to a target&rdquo; I&rsquo;m hoping to trick
myself into taking on the easy things that I wrote down a month
ago that will take a minute to do but are off my immediate radar.</p>

<p>The productivity oscillator suggests both a pattern of work and
the illusion that whatever you are doing is the right thing to do.
If you&rsquo;re stuck trying to get stubborn things accomplished, write
done some new easy goals and get those taken care of. It&rsquo;s
a quantified form of <a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/04/marginally_usef.html">structured procrastination</a> - which it turns out
I&rsquo;ve been talknig about for 10 years.</p>

<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s anything still on my todo list from 2005!</p>

      <p>The first snow of the 2015 season for Ann Arbor happened
today, November 21. The forecast is 6 to 10 inches.</p>

<p>Roads are slippery, and there are reports of a number
of crashes and cars in the ditch on area freeways. I&rsquo;m
listening to the <a href="http://www.broadcastify.com/listen/feed/3913/web/?rl=rr">Washtenaw scanner</a>
on Broadcastify and it&rsquo;s a steady stream of road run-offs.</p>

<p>Farmers Market was busy but snowy. Holiday greenery
was well in evidence. We picked up smoked lake trout,
cabbage, garlic, rapini, and a cookie and a donut for
my market companions.</p>

<p>My favorite source of snow forecasting and snow reporting
is <a href="http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov/">NOHRSC</a>, the
National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center,
a slightly contrived acronym for the National Weather
Service&rsquo;s comprehensive snow information service.</p>

<p>The start of the snow season means that I dust off
the <a href="http://twitter.com/heikkilunta">Heikki Lunta twitter account</a>,
@heikkilunta . Heikki is the Finnish-American god of snow,
and his Twitter account mostly retweets people who are
doing snow dances.</p>

<p>November has been unusually mild and sunny, so this
snow brings us a little closer to normal. Time to check
to be sure that every has hats and gloves and suitably
durable boots and shoes.</p>

      <p>A few notes on setting up OpenVPN in a container.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using CoreOS, which gives me Docker 1.7.1 in the &ldquo;stable&rdquo; branch.</p>

<p>Two different Docker configurations are available that take on this task,
with slightly different setups. Kyle Manna&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn">docker-openvpn</a>
is what I&rsquo;m working with; it in turn is derived from
<a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockvpn">jpetazzo/dockvpn</a> which
solves the same problem slightly differently.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-openvpn-in-a-docker-container-on-ubuntu-14-04">tutorial on Digital Ocean</a>
that describes the setup including client-side support.</p>

<p>A second <a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/run-your-own-dockerized-openvpn-server-at-scaleway/">tutorial by Stefan Scherer</a>
gives instructions for use in the Scaleway ARM-based server cloud.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the stage right now where I downloaded and installed
everything and created an &ldquo;opvn&rdquo; config file that successfully
loads into Tunnelblick, but where it doesn&rsquo;t quite yet have
all of the routing set up. The slight complication in the
configuration is that I want to give access to Amazon
VPCs, so I have a few layers of software-defined networking
to knit together (or to unravel depending on your perspective).</p>

      <p>Our attic is a three season room at best. In the depths
of winter it&rsquo;s really cold, and in the summer time it can
be very hot. There&rsquo;s a nod towards climate control but
it&rsquo;s a long way from the furnace and the space is just
not really practical to equip as full fledged living space.</p>

<p>I have a work table up there (where I am now) with some
tools, a few working shortwave radios, a couple of mostly
working computers, and a fair measure of junk. It&rsquo;s been
the place where toys go when the boys have no interest in playing
with them again, which is to say that everything that&rsquo;s
not Lego is up here.</p>

<p>As long as the weather stays mild, I have ambition to put
the space to better use. At the bare minimum I&rsquo;d like to
get to the point where every day I get upstairs to do
something, and where every time I come back down I have
something in my hands to put to better use somewhere else
or to throw away or recycle. I&rsquo;ve tried to do marathon
sorting and cleaning sessions and it&rsquo;s just not me, but
the every day approach at least gives you a chance for a
series of small wins.</p>

<p>So, bit by bit, work at it. At some point it will get too
cold, and let yourself quit then. Try not to do everything at once.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The a2b3 lunch today was at Madras Masala, we had a crowd of 10.
I had a question about productivity - &ldquo;what do you do every day&rdquo; -
and the answers were a good mix of attempts to be diligent and
questions about whether narrowly focused productivity was even
a good goal.</p>

<p>The small productivity approach that has stuck with me is BJ Fogg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tiny Habits&rdquo; approach, which he writes about on <a href="http://tinyhabits.com/">http://tinyhabits.com/</a> .
The focus is not on New Years Resolution style &ldquo;be a better person&rdquo; goals,
but on very small and attainable accompishments which you can use
to build upon. &ldquo;Floss one tooth&rdquo; is the smallest example goal I can give,
with the understanding that if you can build up a solid habit to do
that every day then there&rsquo;s lots more you can do for better dental health.</p>

<p>The writing equivalent of that is &ldquo;write one paragraph&rdquo;. I know that
trying to blog every single day is a task I&rsquo;ve tried and failed before,
but I also know that it doesn&rsquo;t take forever to write a paragraph, and
you don&rsquo;t have to have more than one idea to express to make that paragraph
worthwhile. Faced with an impossibly big deadline for an impossibly big
project, the thought goes, you might break down your resistance to working
on the effort by declaring victory at the paragraph level.</p>

<p>Next week&rsquo;s lunch (the day after Thanksgiving 2015) is at Morgan and York,
hope to see you there.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>alpine is an old school Unix mail user agent. It first arrived
on the scene as pine in 1992, and when it appeared I remember
how happy I was that there was finally a mailer that I could
hand to people who had never seen Unix before and that they
would get it and be productive on their 14.4 kb/sec dialup
modems.</p>

<p>alpine appeared in 2007 as a rewrite of pine with Unicode
support and a new Apache license. The version of it I&rsquo;m running
advertises itself as</p>

<pre><code>Alpine 2.20 (OSX 67 2015-01-07) built Fri Oct 2 21:36:59 EDT 2015 on Edwards-MacBook-Air.local
</code></pre>

<p>and seems to work just fine. I&rsquo;ve got it pointed at the
old-school shared multiuser mail system that I&rsquo;ve had
for a long time at monkey.org and all is well.</p>

<p>The rubenerd weblog has a nice
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/p3302/">guide to installing alpine on OS X</a>
using your favorite package manager.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of alpine over all web-based
mail systems is just how fast you can delete mail.
It&rsquo;s easy to select by pattern, sort, refile and
especially delete. In comparison, Google&rsquo;s GMail
feels clumsy and slow and impossibly mouse-dependent.</p>

<p>Have I moved all my email over to alpine? No. There&rsquo;s
a very small number of people who I prefer to send
mail to that way, and it&rsquo;s always good to have a
fully functional backup email system that works
perfectly well on a low-bandwidth setup. My workflow
inside GMail is pretty fine tuned at this point and
very different from how I used to use pine, and I&rsquo;m
not willing to go back.</p>

<p>It does remind me of the days before spam, and of the
days when you were actually happy to get messages!</p>

      <p>MDOT plans to do major road construction work on M-14 in Ann Arbor
between Main Street and Miller Road during the spring and summer of 2016.
A construction start date has not been set yet as of November 2015.
In addition, bridge work will reduce M-14 to one lane between I-94
and Miller Road, and betwen Main Street and US-23.</p>

<p>A detailed set of plans is available <a href="http://michigan.gov/mdot/0,4616,7-151-9621_11008_74324---,00.html">on the MDOT web site</a>
and <a href="http://michigan.gov/documents/mdot/MDOT_M14AnnArborBrochure_504933_7.pdf">in a helpful brochure</a>.</p>

<p>The posted detour for M-14 will follow US-23 and I-94 around the freeway
loop around Ann Arbor. The following bridges will also have work done on
that that will close them for some amount of time:</p>

<ul>
<li>M-14 over the Huron River, the railroad tracks and Bandemer Park,</li>
<li>M-14 over Beechwood Drive,</li>
<li>Newport Road over M-14,</li>
<li>M-14 over Maple Road, and</li>
<li>Miller Road over M-14.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was talk of a part of Bandemer Park to be used as a staging area
for MDOT construction equipment. A review of the city&rsquo;s Legistar system
did not unearth anything that would have been a necessary city review or
approval of that.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chuck Warpehoski for the heads up.</p>

<p>I was an early adopter of LinkedIn back when it first got started.
It was interesting, fun, cool to collect all your friends.</p>

<p>Now, my sense is that my LinkedIn profile is useless at best and
actively unhelpful at worst. Why would I want to publish a standardized
autobiography of work experience in a medium that doesn&rsquo;t reward
complicated life histories? It&rsquo;s not helpful - what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s
not clear that it&rsquo;s ever been helpful for the narrowly defined task
of getting work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested in hearing from you if you have deleted your LinkedIn
(or have stayed away from it).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>There is now a Localwiki instance up and running for Jackson, Michigan. See
<a href="https://localwiki.org/jackson/">https://localwiki.org/jackson/</a> for the details.</p>

<p>Like any Localwiki just starting out, it is woefully incomplete. You&rsquo;re welcome
to contribute to it, especially if you have some local knowledge of the area.
The site was seeded with a handful of articles that had been created from the
adjacent Arborwiki, and while it&rsquo;s starting up we&rsquo;re using the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/268836399886132/">Arborwiki Facebook page</a> to help
push things along.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to discover a new place is through the restaurants that have
some local notability but that aren&rsquo;t at the usual highway exits. The first
discovery from the Jackson Localwiki is the
<a href="https://localwiki.org/jackson/West_Texas_BBQ">West Texas BBQ</a> on Brooklyn Rd
south of the city. &ldquo;Authentic Texas pit style barbeque&rdquo; is the attraction. Haven&rsquo;t
been there myself, but now that I know it&rsquo;s there it will be worth a detour.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The Melting Pot in downtown Ann Arbor is closing as of today, November 16, 2015,
according to a post on the restaurant&rsquo;s web site and a story in MLive.</p>

<p>The last regular inspection of The Melting Pot by the Washtenaw County Health
Department was on May 26, 2015. It turned up 11 violations, and some of them
would be the sort of problems that would make you not want to go back.
A <a href="http://food-inspections.annarbortelegraph.com/2015-05-26-melting-pot">copy of the inspection report</a> makes for tough reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Observed the following: 1. Blackberries with mold like growth. 2. Mascapone: 2 - <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>27</sub>. 12 <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>. - Past date. 3. 3 butter milks <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub>. - Past date. 4. Prosciutto 10/13/2014.- Past date. 5. Two half &amp; half <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub>.- Past date. 6. Two whole milks <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub>.- Past date. 7. Bush mills whiskey had fly&rsquo;s floating around in bottle. 8. Dewars white label scotch had fly&rsquo;s floating around in bottle. 9. Cutty Sark Whisky had fly&rsquo;s floating around in bottle. FOOD shall be safe, unADULTERATED, and, as specified under # 3-601.12, honestly presented. (P) To correct discard all noted items into the garbage. Corrected: Person in charge discarded all noted items into the garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The restaurant should be inspected every 6 months, which means that their
routine inspection should be in November 2015. I&rsquo;ve sent a query to the
county health deparment to determine if the restaurant was inspected yet
this month, and if so what the results were.</p>
