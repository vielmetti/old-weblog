<h2 id="todo:5b51c9e8380c18fc2ee8d866662d01d8">Todo</h2>

<ul>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete but no-op,
next phase will do the markup too. I like the idea of
assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki.</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>
</ul>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-lob-a-postcard-printer/">lob a postcard: printer sends cards via API</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Lob.com has an API to send postcards-as-a-service ($0.70 per each,
full custom both sides). Details at <a href="https://lob.com/services/postcards">https://lob.com/services/postcards</a> .
It works, but all of the user interface is up to you; if you know
a good service for delivering a single full-custom postcard with
postage that actually has a user interface and not an API for less
than $1.00 each, let me know and I&rsquo;ll update here.</p>

<p>Also in this business is PostalMethods with a Postcard API based on SOAP.
That&rsquo;s not a convenient interface in the languages that I use, but you
can look at the API at <a href="http://www.postalmethods.com/lp/postcard-api">http://www.postalmethods.com/lp/postcard-api</a> .
Their prices for postcards run $1.50 per each or less, with quantity
discounts - see <a href="http://www.postalmethods.com/pricing">http://www.postalmethods.com/pricing</a> for details.</p>

<p>Postful used to have an API for postcards. They were
<a href="http://blog.click2mail.com/articles/view/click2mail-acquires-postful/">bought by Click2Mail in 2011</a>. Pricing for Click2Mail&rsquo;s postcards starts at $0.25
per card plus $0.284 postcard, but there&rsquo;s a $2.00 minimum if
you don&rsquo;t have credits on account. I wasn&rsquo;t able to determine
at first glance whether their REST API applied to onesy-twoesy
printing options, though it was clear that if you wanted to send
1000 cards that the pricing would be competitive.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A simple recipe that you can order from your favorite barista:
an espresso shot over ice. Leave enough room to add a spot of
half and half. Cold, refreshing, and very strong.</p>

<p>To try: a shot of espresso over shaved ice. I think this is
doable at Ann Arbor Farmers Market where you&rsquo;d go to the stall
where a granny is selling shaved ice, and then walk a plain snow cone
over to the Roos Roast stand for your espresso shot.</p>

<p>Inspired by a Facebook post from Allen Leibowitz in Texas ordering a snow cone
and the surrounding commentary.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Lior Zoref has a new book out called
<a href="http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1471756">Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything</a>
(Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have
a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the
new shelf at Mallett&rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday
afternoon. Mallett&rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot
to be on a warm day.</p>

        <img src="http://media.aadl.org/covers/1471756_200.jpg" />
    
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits
without repeating the author&rsquo;s technique of using the word
&ldquo;Mindsharing&rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity. I&rsquo;ll try to
unpack the approach with a simpler version of the
strategy, which seems to boil down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make lots of connections online, even with people who you don&rsquo;t
know very well</li>
<li>Ask them really good questions when you are trying to make a decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of connections is the biggest suggestion here; rather than
get help from a small circle of trusted friends, the crowdsourcing
approach to human improvement relies on good ideas coming from
large or very large sets of people (at least 250), and relies on
pulling in unexpectedly good recommendations from people who don&rsquo;t
know you very well.  Lior references Mark Granovetter&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Strength
of Weak Ties&rdquo; (1973) early on, but of course Granovetter didn&rsquo;t
know about Quora, Facebook, LinkedIn, and the host of other online
properties and lists that allow for computer-mediated interaction
with people at a distance.</p>

<p>There is an art to asking good questions that could fill a book.
If you look on the biggest question-answering websites like Quora
or Stack Exchange and start to follow along, you will quickly find
that good questions get rewarded with positive feedback and bad
questions (or impossible to answer questions) get ignored or criticized.
Lior points out the there&rsquo;s a very big difference between typing a query
into a search engine and asking a live audience the same thing -
the human element of the search allows a personal connection.</p>

<p>Lior is known for a TED talk (he brought an ox onstage) and is out
promoting his book. The book itself feels like an ideal airplane
read for someone who is aspiring to self-improvement, is facing a
career change, and who hasn&rsquo;t figured out what the point is quite
yet with Facebook as a career tool.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-midland-g-227/">Notes on the Midland G-227 GMRS/FRS radio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Midland G-227 GMRS radio, quantity two, a gift from the
Wells-Becker Motorcycle Emporium in Dexter, Michigan.</p>

<p>I replaced batteries in both of them, they take 4xAAA.</p>

<p>Radio 1 successfully hears static when the (M) monitor
button is depresssed; Radio 2 hears nothing.</p>

<p>A manual is at <a href="http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html">http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html</a>
which describes the frequencies of the 22 channels it can transmit on.
A reasonable next step is to get my NooElec SDR tuner out and see if
I can monitor a transmission. If Radio 2 transmits, I suspect a loose
connection to the speaker.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midland-G-227C2-7-Mile-22-Channel-Two-Way/dp/B00008JOMG">Amazon reviews</a>
complain mostly that the range of the radios is not &ldquo;7 miles&rdquo; as
marketed, but closer to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mile to 1 mile on land. That&rsquo;s typical
for this band as I understand it.</p>

<p>In the same gift also a Uniden labelled &ldquo;Scramble&rdquo; that has a NOAA
weather logo on it, so it probably also monitors weather frequencies.</p>

<p>You can never have too many radios!</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-18-food-coop-notes/">food coop notes for July 18, 2015</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Some notes over a cup of coffee and some cold roast chicken. I need
to mix up my menu selections at the coop more so that I can remember
what I was writing by what I ate; I usually eat the same thing!</p>

<p>Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain were here at the coop, doing
the NY Times crossword. (Saturday crossword in 36:05, a mid-day triumph.)</p>

<p>At Farmer&rsquo;s Market: cherries, parsley, kale, potatoes, dill, tomatoes.
The potatoes will be boiled and dressed with a dill vinaigrette.
(I had to look up the word vinaigrette.) The recipes I found add
green beans and boiled eggs to a salad with cold potatoes, using
a mustard vinaigrette with added chopped dill. The cherries will
probably just be eaten out of hand.</p>

<p>The UP travel discussion included the obligatory discussion of insects,
including ticks (&ldquo;like bedbugs, for the woods&rdquo;) and horrible sand
flies that will swarm you and leave you screaming running from the
beach. There&rsquo;s a good reason that the UP has miles of undeveloped beaches.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t mention bugs in the UP without remembering
<a href="http://somethingscrawlinginmyhair.com/">The Backyard Arthropod Project</a>,
&ldquo;A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI&rdquo;,
by Tim Eisele.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still hacking away at generating interesting reports from
the <a href="https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist">stringdist</a>
package from Mark van der Loo. Yesterday&rsquo;s post was
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31486913/r-producing-a-list-of-near-matches-with-stringdist-and-stringdistmatrix">R: producing a list of near matches with stringdist and stringdistmatrix</a> and the answers provided
helped unearth the melt() function from the reshape2 library,
and with <em>that</em> you take a matrix and turn it into an edge list.
A little bit of filtering, and you get a report of near matches
in a list, enough for me to catch variant spellings of
vinagrette to vinaigrette in a &ldquo;make test&rdquo; step.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow was fun for this task, I&rsquo;m going to try it again.
The process of describing your problem in enough detail that someone
who knows the issue can add the one or two lines of code to make
it work is a useful exercise. It&rsquo;s the opposite of a search
engine in many ways - of course I could find melt() once I know
its name, but if you don&rsquo;t know the name you can&rsquo;t find anything.</p>

<p>The next bit of interestingness has to do with turning the dist
data structure returned by stringdist into a variety of useful
images. There&rsquo;s a package that dumps out a &ldquo;dendogram&rdquo;, and if I&rsquo;m
careful in formatting the data I think I can coerce R into producing
data that can be imported directly into the tools that
Valdis Krebs
has written for network exploration and visualization. The
promise within R is a &ldquo;distgraph&rdquo; that does the visualization,
but I&rsquo;m not yet finding the cadre of experts who use that.</p>

<p>The art on the walls is Julie Marron-Parker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunburst&rdquo;. She writes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let the sun shine.</p>

<p>Living in Michigan (160 days of sun per year) I have come to
appreciate when the sun is out. This piece brings the energy of the
sun into the world, regardless of the weather outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tom Meloche writes about <a href="http://tommeloche.com/the-doorway-effect/">the doorway effect</a>,
where going through a doorway wipes out your short term memory
to make way for new short term memories. It got me thinking
about the memory palace
, and how you might construct
in your mind a series of portals and doorways to walk through so
that you can remember a series of items in such a way that you
take advantage of the doorway effect to pull memories in and out
of your short term thinking. The technology is &ldquo;mnemotechnics&rdquo;,
that&rsquo;s a good keyword to pull lots of interesting thinking
(which sometimes sounds like crazytalk).</p>

<p>That reminds me - I need to move to another room, so that I can
remember what I need to do here.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The problem, simply stated, is that of typoes and inconsistent
spelling and pluraliziation. Let&rsquo;s say you have a collection of
text that you want to annotate with some metadata, like categories
and tags. You don&rsquo;t want to set aside ahead of time exactly which
tags you want to use, but you want to catch through some test or
lint step that you&rsquo;ve done something wrong by typing &ldquo;apples&rdquo; into
a field that really has &ldquo;apple&rdquo; most of the time. A good algorithm
will catch minor deviations from the norm and advise you when you
should go back with a fresh pair of eyes and do an edit.
The bigger problem is
deduplication
.</p>

<p>My first pass at a proposed solution was to look for a version of
the old Unix program &ldquo;uniq&rdquo; that would have an approximate match.
There is also an old Unix program &ldquo;agrep&rdquo; (&ldquo;approximate grep&rdquo;) from
Udi Manber.</p>

<p>Neither of these first lines of attack to see if someone had
completely solved the problem before did the trick, but some
searching around and a conversation with
John Hritz

hit the neuron that remembered the algorithm called the
Levenshtein distance
.
That led me to
Wikibook: Algorithm Implementation
,
and its set of
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance code</a>. It so happened that there
was a very slow implementation in the bash shell included
in that collection that was a cut and paste and two lines of
code from being exactly what I needed. A little bit of glue
code in awk and I was ready to go.</p>

<p>Now the problem with cut and paste two lines of code is that this
particular implmentation is very slow, albeit correct. Given the
choice between slow correct code and fast code that&rsquo;s wrong (because
of the bug that you don&rsquo;t yet understand), I&rsquo;ll take the slow code
plus a comment and a writeup that describes how to make it faster.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m really after is just the pairwise comparison of a set
of words where the two words are close to each other. If the
distance between two words is greater than some threshhold, I don&rsquo;t need
to go any further. That algorithmic shortcut isn&rsquo;t in the library
codes that I found.</p>

<p>The bigger question is how to write a
checklist
and implement it in code to make sure that a big body of work stays
internally consistent. It&rsquo;s one thing to have a
categorization
rule for your writers that says &ldquo;always use the
singular&rdquo;, but very much something different to have Test 38 in
your automated test corpus apply that rule and notice when it&rsquo;s
wrong.</p>

<p>Some of what I write here is

      </h3>
      <p>One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move
a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over
categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same;
the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that
look different. For instance:</p>

<p>There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should
be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.</p>

<p>There are a number of posts about books in the collection, which
should be connected to a lookup for that book in your favorite
bookstore or my favorite library.</p>

<p>There are a number of people mentioned, and a people index would
be great so you can browse and not just search.</p>

<p>Mostly I&rsquo;m after improving the browsing experience, as much for
me as for anyone else. If you have to find things with a search
engine, you are stuck in a world where you have to know that something
has a particular name. By offering a browsing infrastructure first,
you cherrypick the best search terms and put them up front.</p>

<p>Some of this will need pen and paper design&hellip;.</p>

      <p>Eight of us met for lunch at <a href="http://aysesturkishcafe.com/">Ayse&rsquo;s</a> today. It was a normal
Thursday in that regard, as that&rsquo;s a pretty typical size for
the lunch group these days.</p>

<p>We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time
to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning
or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a
remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make
sure that the things that needed to get done got done. Among the
tasks that took up lots more time than they deserved included
dealing with the health insurance marketplace and with other
healthcare providers for dealing with billing and accounting problems.</p>

<p>Three of the people at lunch were new to the table, but since Ann

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m trying my best to get this blog ready for production.
The tasks remaining include the following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a reasonable home page with pagination. Somehow I need
to provide some kind of access to almost 2000 posts, and they
don&rsquo;t all fit on a single page. Sort through the design to make
old things reachable, and then worry next about the formatter.
(This is done at least minimally, though the provided paginator
interface uses a list structure that&rsquo;s not nice. Still, it gets
me to what I need to in a ping.) Open discussion on gohugo is
<a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441/3">Pagination and group by date</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Publish to Github Pages, using vielmetti.github.io. I did this
once (using Octopress) so it should be straightforward to do it again.
I already do have a proper github repo (or nearly proper, it may
be missing some key bits). Done; don&rsquo;t have a perfect build script
yet, but there&rsquo;s at least a start.</p></li>

<li><p>Import all sorts more nonsense here, including a bunch of Superpatron
and Blogger&rsquo;s Secret and FOIA Coordiator weblogs. There&rsquo;s no particular
reason not to make it all one big soup. Import from Typepad is problematic
but not impossible and that would be a good addition to the supported work;
in particular it&rsquo;s not evidently possible to export Markdown from Typepad,
just HTML.</p></li>

<li><p>Sort out theme issues so that I get a reasonable display for category
and subcategory pages. I may have to write some things down by hand
to get an understanding of what I really want. As it is right now
those pages render as blank, in part because I need to convert a bunch
of data imperfectly imported, which was throwing errors in my
templates, which in turn was breaking the build. Dealing with the
errored out builds is a question again for gohugo,
<a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/taxononomy/1445">taxononomy</a></p></li>

<li><p>Deal with the date problems. Lots of dates got imported without a timezone,
but that was not the real issue; the real issue was also that lots got
imported with &ldquo;layout: post&rdquo;. Take that out and it seems to fix things.</p></li>

<li><p>Request a dump of the image cache from Typepad.</p></li>

<li><p>Implement, somehow, &ldquo;edit on github&rdquo; so that my workflow is easier.
This might only be on the preview version. Some notes on the Hugo discussion
forums
describing how to do that are on

      </h3>
      <p>This weblog, which may or may not ever see the
light of day, is about a great many things.</p>

<p>There are other blogs waiting to be written that
don&rsquo;t have that infinite vista; they could easily
be much more narrow. What, then, do you write about?
Let&rsquo;s count some of the options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker on the Raspberry Pi, following Hypriot&rsquo;s lead.</li>
<li>Just Docker in general, and Dockerizing various things.</li>
<li>Recipes, since I have a bunch already.</li>
<li>Power Outage Maps, in particular try to wrangle data from OpenEI here.</li>
<li>FOIA, espeically Michigan FOIA, to follow my book</li>
<li>Daily Coffee and Wifi, the usual random walk</li>
<li>Civic Technology, in whatever format that takes</li>
</ul>

<p>More and more it&rsquo;s the case that the old &ldquo;Vacuum&rdquo; weblog is
feeling vacuous - not enough interaction with people, and not
the right platform to go deep on anything. And &ldquo;Typepad&rdquo; feels
really old, especially compared to everything else.</p>

<p>Fortunately if I&rsquo;m writing in Markdown I can mostly drop anything
I want anywhere it wants to go.</p>

<p>The other great weird idea of course is to mimic the old print
notebook with all kinds of nifty sidebars, one sidebar per item.</p>

<p>What do I want to have happen as a result of all of this not
inconsiderable effort? Creative control to be sure, to be able
to type something and see it appear exactly as desired on the
screen. Community engagement is another, to be part of a group
of people all working toward a common goal.</p>

<p>Of course the other thing that I could do is take some old weblog,
revisit it, and republish it in some other format. Blogger&rsquo;s Secret
is the reasonable one to do that to. It has virutally no traffic
now, but if I re-serialized it, it might do the trick.</p>

      <p>Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish
recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; category, and also
created a &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&rsquo;s sort of like
a subcategory but not really&hellip;well it is as long as I am careful
about it.</p>

<p>Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from
mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use
of Gopher as a cookbook. It is said that an old Mac was portable
enough to be set up in the kitchen to look up recipes.</p>

<p>What I want to do is set things up so that if the post is from the
recipes category, then the recipes list will show up in the sidebar
of that post, sorted alphabetically. I think I can make that work.</p>

      <p>One of the challenges in getting things started is figuring
out where the end product is going to live. Hugo has its own
web server which is pretty nice, but since it generates static
pages, the results can really go anywhere.</p>

<p>This tutorial goes through the process in excruciating detail</p>

<p><a href="http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/">http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/</a></p>

<p>but somehow fails to make it easy. What I&rsquo;d like is a publishing
workflow that just like the normal Hugo workflow puts things online
instantly once they are built.</p>

<p>This one deploys with CodeShip</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com">https://github.com/imperialwicket/imperialwicket.com</a></p>

<p>Finally, one that focuses on the github side of things:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950">https://gist.github.com/chrisjacob/825950</a></p>

<p>The approach I have runs like so, it assumes that you have
a working directory &ldquo;~/src/hugo&rdquo; with your blog in it, and
a target directory &ldquo;~/src/vielmetti.github.io&rdquo; set up for
github pages.</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/src/hugo
hugo -d ../vielmetti.github.io --theme=vacuum
# wait to build, then
cd ../vielmetti.github.io
git add -A .
git commit -m &quot;build complete&quot;
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>By having separate build directories like this you can keep the
continuous build on your draft setup going, and then push a
working version whenever you&rsquo;re perfectly happy with the result.
Not like anyone is really perfectly happy with any blog.</p>

<p>When the pasta is done, drain it, and then put about half of it

more cheese. Top with breadcrumbs and then sprinkle a little romano
cheese on top and a few pinches of nutmeg for flavor.</p>

      <p>Themes can be customized by editing the top matter, or by
directly changing the theme. The challenge is understanding
enough of how the moving parts interconnect to make it do what
you want it to do, or at least enough of them so that you don&rsquo;t
have a blog that just looks like a weak ripoff of someone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This tutorial</p>

<p><a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13">http://discuss.gohugo.io/t/creating-a-minimal-working-template/135/13</a></p>

<p>does a very nice job of helping you walk through the simple
bits. It does not get far enough to give you a sense for how
to get pagination working but that&rsquo;s at least a start.</p>

<p>There should be a super easy way to iterate through all
of the themes. I&rsquo;m looking for one that already nicely has
some way of doing categories or tags or some kind of metadata.
It would be extra super swell to find one that has a sidebar
and footer structure to so that I can (finally) recreate notebook
pages. I think I have someone that goes OK as a start - it
wants to insert dynamic content into the sidebar for the home page,
and then also to insert content that depends on the categories
or tags for individual pages, so that the whole thing feels more
like a carefully constructed notebook and less like a simple blog.</p>

<p>At some point you can iterate endlessly on appearance and completely
lose track of contents. Fortuantely I have a body of work that I really
want to see in this, so that motivates some level of forward progress.
For instance, I&rsquo;d love to see categories actually work here, since I
have some content that belongs together. I also have sidebar ideas
that really want to be exercised again.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The task of the night was getting a few years worth of Typepad posts
into Hugo.</p>

<p>My first step was to convert to Jekyll format, which I did using this
typepad_to_jekyll Ruby gem:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll">https://github.com/koozie/typepad_to_jekyll</a></p>

<p>You then need to do a few things to get the Jekyll files exactly right
for Hugo:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the date format</li>
<li>Rewrite the Categories</li>
<li>Download and relink all of the images</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing the format for &ldquo;date&rdquo; was a one-liner in perl with the -i (&ldquo;edit in
place&rdquo;) flag.  I didn&rsquo;t get to the category rewrite or the image rescue yet.
The approach I took was to simply hack on the output files, rather than
change the source code to the typepad_to_jekyll program, but if you were
serious about it you&rsquo;d do the latter and fork it until it did the right thing.</p>

<p>Relinking all of the images requires opening a support ticket because Typepad
does not have an easy image export. Actually image hosting is a real
challenge and I don&rsquo;t know exactly the right way to do it inside Hugo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll need to adjust the theme or pick a new theme so that it only shows
the first n posts on a page and then paginates, and I also need to adjust
it so that it shows categories. The show everything approach is unreasonable
when you have 1000s of pages to show off. On the other hand, the most
reasonable themes that I can find that look nice don&rsquo;t have pagination
turned on by default. There&rsquo;s some learning curve to roll my own, maybe
one that has some kind of reasonable sidebar structure.</p>

      <p>So 634 pages from my Github Gollum based Wiki markup all got imported
into Hugo and it rendered all of them in 828 ms, or basically under
a second to pull in everything I&rsquo;ve ever written. Astonishingly fast.</p>

<p>Alas, those files while they are in Markdown are not really ready for
direct import, since they have [[double brackets]] everywhere that
get uglified. The other limiting factor is the date marker that&rsquo;s not
included with them so they all show up as January 1, 0001 which is
funny the first few times and then not funny.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Hugo have an import function? It does, for converting front
matter. The closest for importing other things are the various Jekyll
converters which aren&rsquo;t really the same.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Progress, actually quite a lot of it:</p>

<p>The problem, neatly stated. Docker is good for bringing up single services ("microservices"), but sometimes your application needs more than one thing running for the whole thing to work. Enter "docker compose", formerly "fig", which automates the process of running various Docker commands in the right order with the right arguments all driven from a configuration file. As described by their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.</p>

<p>The particular task I have in front of me is launching Node-RED and mosquitto (an MQTT broker) together on a Raspberry Pi 2 which is running Hypriot and Docker. Most of the background for <em>why</em> that's a relevant task is at this post on Hypriot, <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-compose-nodejs-haproxy/">How to use Docker Compose to run complex multi container apps on your Raspberry Pi</a>, which I dutifully and successfully managed to run all of the examples from. </p>

<p>Emboldened by this I tried to get Wordpress running with MySQL but got stuck because of a variety of things (not the least of which was some over-enthusiastic documentation that downplayed the complexity of that task, and the lack of a Pi-specific Wordpress Docker images). But having had the taste of what might be I carried on until I managed to get something to work for what I really wanted: Node-RED running alongside mosquitto so that I could have a local MQTT broker to talk to.</p>

<pre>
nodered:
  image: nieleyde/rpi2-nodered
  command: flows.json
  volumes:
    - /home/pi/node-red:/root/.node-red
  ports: 
    - "1880:1880"
  links:
    - mosquitto

mosquitto:
  image: nieleyde/rpi-mosquitto
  ports:
    - "1883:1883"
</pre>

<p>Some subtleties to note:</p>

<p>The nieleyde/rpi2-nodered runs on the Pi 2; there's a corresponding nieleyde/rpi-nodered for the Pi. Both are ARM images. I haven't yet tweaked this to run on x86, but if you do, you'll need to update the "image" stanzas everywhere.</p>

<p>The "command" and "volumes" stanzas in the nodered configuration serve to make Docker mount a subdirectory on the host machine where the flows.json file is stored; this makes changes to the configuration persistent. If you want a read-only configuration, you'll need to change this; I haven't gotten that far yet. It might also make sense to have a data volume container, but again I'm not there yet.</p>

<p>The "mosquitto" configuration is extremely bare bones and runs the default config, which is wide open. I haven't gotten far enough to replace the config file with something better, but that's an obvious next step.</p>

<p>From within Node-RED you refer to this internal MQTT server at hostname "mosquitto", port "1883". If the links stanza was changed to "mqtt" and the mosquitto section was changed to "mqtt" you'd then refer to the MQTT server at hostname "mqtt".</p>
