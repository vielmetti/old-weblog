<ul>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.</li>
<li>A whole &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; section, because there&rsquo;s so much of that,
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

<p>Storm last night. We got a downpour, some wind and lightning, but nothing
too bad. A nearby <a href="http://www3.a2gov.org/RainGauges/">City of Ann Arbor rain gauge</a>
on S Industrial reported 1.12&rdquo; of rain, and at the peak of the storm rain
was coming down at 0.41&rdquo; in 15 minutes. The scanner was full of power
lines sparking and trees down.</p>

<p>Worst hit was the Sleeping Bear Dunes area, where some of the
adjacent communities had complete power blackouts. There was also a
tornado in the Thumb. The <a href="http://www.weather.gov/apx/2015Aug2recap">National Weather Service recap</a> for the August 2, 2015 storms gives much more detail.
Softball sized hail was seen near West Branch, MI.</p>

<p>Current 8:45 a.m. report is 60,318 DTE Energy customers without power, and
91,802 Consumers Energy customers without power. DTE does not generally
report outages by county, just by zip code, but I have all of the zip
codes so I should be able to estimate county level totals.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A blogroll is a list of other weblogs that the writer links to,
in the hopes that they will get a link back in return. It&rsquo;s one
way to establish yourself as part of a community of writers.</p>

<p>The practice of keeping and maintaining a blogroll is completely
gone, as self-linking networks like Facebook and Twitter have
obviated the need for explicitly calling out those linkages.
Our self-updating feeds simply stream a continuous loop of
content into our willing eyeballs, interspersed with as many
advertisements as we will stand.</p>

<p>Still, blogrolls are useful as a quaint reminder of times past,
and how we once organized our reading in the days before efficient
newsfeeds became the rule of the day.  Look at the bottom of the
far left of this blog for mine.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">Knolling</span> is the practice of organizing things neatly, especially to
arrange things in parallel lines or at right angles.</p>

<p>Thanks to <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Jason Kottke</span> for the
<a href="http://kottke.org/14/03/always-be-knolling">always be knolling</a> idea and

<p>Previously spotted in a similar way, the &ldquo;5S&rdquo; process of getting
rid of clutter, especially &ldquo;seiton&rdquo; or &ldquo;neatness&rdquo;. Everything goes
into its own place. Knolling is a bit more freeform and does away
with explicit labels.</p>

<p>It does get me to thinking thought that I&rsquo;m very tired of some of the
presentation of screens that I look at all the time. My Gmail inbox is
always a simple list; would it not be that hard some time to make it a
grid of squares with people&rsquo;s photos in them, so that I could see at
a glance who was in my inbox?</p>

      <p>In his <a href="http://cyber.jotwell.com/an-internet-x-ray-machine-for-the-masses/">An internet x-ray machine for the masses</a>, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">mitmproxy</span>,
a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to
get between your browser and the Internet and poke at
(and change) the traffic going between the two.</p>

<p><a href="http://mitmproxy.org">http://mitmproxy.org</a> is the home of mitmproxy. It&rsquo;s
the work of <span style="background-color: #bfffff;">Aldo Cortesi</span> and a cast of
hundreds of contributors on github at <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy">https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy</a> .
I used the OS X binary distribution from the download page.
There&rsquo;s also a nifty Dockerized version on
Dockerhub as <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/">docker pull mitmproxy/mitmproxy</a>
to get you started quickly too.</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (or monkey-in-the-middle) systems are not
new, of course, and Dug Song&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/">dsniff</a>
package dates to 1999. What we&rsquo;ve learned in a decade and a half
is that security through obscurity vanishes in the face of better
tools for looking at network traffic as it&rsquo;s going by with high
level tools for making sense of what&rsquo;s there.</p>

<p>As ever, all of these tools have both benign and malicious uses.
If you can trick someone into using your proxy server for their
traffic, all kinds of foolishness can result. Better is the use
that you proxy your own traffic and behold all of the cookies,
beacons, and ads that sneak into your everyday browsing experience.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-31-soundcloud/">Soundcloud, now and in the future</a>
      </h3>
      <p>If you have exactly one copy of something and it&rsquo;s only on Soundcloud,
this would be an opportune time to make a backup. That&rsquo;s always a good
idea anyway not to rely on single web servers for anything, but it&rsquo;s
especially notable in the light of these articles.</p>

<p>First, the upbeat <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-07-10/can-soundcloud-be-the-facebook-of-music-">Bloomberg Business</a> article of July 10, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; SoundCloud’s potential is fascinating, and perhaps unique.
The founders have ambitious goals that respond to changes in the
way music and sound are created and consumed. It’s a beautiful
dream. So long as all the crucial participants—labels, publishers,
artists, SoundCloud itself—can agree on how to share it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, the downbeat <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/72325/20150729/soundcloud-losing-money-fast-as-record-labels-apply-licensing-pressure.htm">Tech Times</a> on July 29, 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We recently reported on rumors that popular music streaming service
SoundCloud is planning on adding a subscription-based tier to its
currently all-free streaming service, and that rumor was just
confirmed by company co-founder Eric Wahlforss in a conversation
with the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears that the impetus
behind the development of the subscription tier is clear: the company
is in dire need of cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Dire need of cash&rdquo; because record labels are not thrilled with
the beautiful dream of listening to the world&rsquo;s music for free.
Remember how Napster turned out? It was a beautiful dream, too,
but labels and publishers just saw it as piracy. This from
<a href="http://www.edmtunes.com/2015/06/editorial-believe-it-or-not-soundcloud-is-fighting-the-good-fight/">EDM Tunes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2015 SoundCloud controversy is Napster all over again. We
aren’t sharing files anymore, we’re sharing sound. 15 years ago
record labels objected to us downloading their music, now they
object to us streaming it&hellip;.</p>

<p>Like Napster, SoundCloud is a goldfish that’s been unwillingly
thrust into battle with three super-wale companies. Just for a
matter of reference, consider that SoundCloud has about 200 employees,
while the Sony, Universal, and Warner corporate networks employ
more than 200,000. At this point, SoundCloud is fighting to survive,
and unfortunately has received a lot of critical media attention.
Since its 2007 inception, SoundCloud has served as a haven for
electronic music producers and fans; allowing sound to be seamlessly
shared from artist to listener. This luxury is being threatened,
and we’re all pissed about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, enjoy Soundcloud while you can, and when you are producing things
for it make sure you keep a backup on your own machines!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two
people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away.
I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).</p>

<p>The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&rsquo;m thinking about
quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch
a postcard from the command line of my Mac. It&rsquo;s got to be easier (so I don&rsquo;t
have to look up command line options) but the basic structure works pretty well.</p>

<p>Postcards are archaic, perhaps, and also perhaps more expensive per each than
reaching someone through Facebook advertising. I do have to say though that I
love sending them, and love receiving them in return. I&rsquo;d love to do the experiment
of $20 spent on Facebook vs $20 spent on postcards, and wonder what the return
would be; or better yet, $20 spent on each and identify particular synergies between
super-high-tech and old-fashioned.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The card I got in the mail today was from Peter Honeyman and Lynn Chamberlain,
two of my faithful correspondents. They sent a photo of the Pickle Barrel House Museum
in Grand Marais, Michigan. The historic marker there reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pioneer Cooperage Company of Chicago designed this small
vacation cottage, which stood on the shores of nearby Sable Lake
from 1926 until about 1937. It was built for William Donahey, creator
of the Chicago Tribune cartoon story The Teenie Weenies. The house
was constructed as a typical barrel would have been, only on a much
larger scale. The main barrel contained a living area on the first
floor and a bedroom on the second. A pantry connected this barrel
to a smaller single-story one, which housed a kitchen. Donahey spent
ten summers at the cottage with his wife, Mary, herself a noted
author of children&rsquo;s books. The structure was then moved to its
current site and used as a tourist information center. The Pickle
Barrel House is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>Sounds like a destination for next time!</p>

      <p>A first round of postcards sent via Lob.com have arrived or are

sending them made it clear that I need to do some simple user
interface improvements. I think I can cope with the current situation
on producing the card back photo, but again there&rsquo;s more work to be
done making the text on the page wonderful.</p>

<p>A reasonable question is, why do you send them? Why not send
email or a Facebook message? The answer is fairly simple, no one
ever remarks on my email prowess but even an ordinary card
elicits a response.</p>

      <p>I bought a little box of
<span style="background-color: #ffffbf;">tomatillos</span>
from Argus Farm Stop. The question now is what to do with them.</p>

<p>Suggestions so far include:</p>

<ul>
<li>fried like green tomatoes, slice thin, coat with a thin batter</li>
<li>roasted them with onions and jalapenos and make into a salsa</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/raw-tomatillo-salsa/">raw tomatillo salsa</a> a la Rick Bayless</li>

<li>baked shrimp with tomatillos, feta, and cilantro</li>
<li>carne en su jugo, a la La Fiesta Mexicana in Ypsilanti</li>
<li>in pastel de Montezuma</li>
</ul>

<p>What I ended up making was a very simplified version of
<a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/tomatillo_breakfast_tacos.html">Tomatillo Breakfast Tacos</a>,
reducing the recipe to just onions, tomatillos, and eggs.
Cook chopped onions and chopped tomatillos over medium
heat (6 of 10) until the tomatillos are soft and the
onions are browned, about 12 minutes. Crack some eggs over the top of the
mixture and cover. Cook without stirring until the eggs are
set to your desired doneness.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad.
The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&rsquo;ve
been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes
and what-not. It&rsquo;s a chance to review old words.</p>

<p>One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at
times system called <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a>. Zemanta would
figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions
for related links, both to things that you had written as well as
to things other people had written.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided as part of the transformation of the old weblog into
the new one to unlink those &ldquo;related links&rdquo;, in the hope that
eventually Hugo&rsquo;s own system will create some either algorithmically
derived relations or at least an easier way to do that by hand.</p>

<p>In the meantime I&rsquo;m looking closely at what Zemanta did so I can
undo it. The first set of artifacts is a &ldquo;fieldset&rdquo; with its links,
and that&rsquo;s easy enough to search and destroy. Occasionally but not
always I find my links decorated with a <code>class=&quot;zem_slink&quot;</code> marker
that&rsquo;s a little harder to find. Most insidious so far was exactly
one time where Zemanta (or Typepad) rewrote or wrote an Amazon link
to include an affiliate link points to Zemanta, and not to me.</p>

<p>Rewriting 1500+ pages is going to take a while. The biggest question
is unpublishing some of them, since time has passed and I don&rsquo;t need
to republish everything. There&rsquo;s conversion from HTML to Markdown
to remove the uglies, spelling errors to catch, next
categories and taxonomies to fill, layout to work on, etc. At
some point I need to sort out image management. But first I&rsquo;m going
to understand the consequences of previous convenience decisions
I made to use Zemanta and to undo that decision.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wrote a tiny R script that generates maps. The challenge
today is to find a portable environment so that I can deploy this script
on shared infrastructure. The project took 30 minutes of MacBook Air processor
time running full blast parallel, and while I don&rsquo;t care about wall clock time
to complete the effort I do care about building something that I can hand
off to someone else to run.</p>

<p>The hope is that the <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/ropensci">ropensci</a> Docker
package from the Rocker project is the answer, or most of the answer, for this.
Rocker has built R images where lots of useful packages have been installed,
including systems where the install directions are a little bit complex.</p>

<p>With all complicated software environments the biggest challenge is dealing
with dependencies. If you want to use the latest and greatest fast algorithms,
you have to be prepared to spin up on what the cool kids are doing in the
rest of their environment. If somehow you can jump to the edge of the development
in the algorithm world without being tripped up by the hairy dependency graph
that got you there, it can be a lot more fun.</p>

<p>So; install Docker on the Mac with &lsquo;boot2docker&rsquo;; then</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">docker pull rocker/ropensci
docker run -it rocker/ropensci R

<p>and poof, you have an environment current to this month&rsquo;s desktop of leading

&ldquo;social listening&rdquo; for a living, tracking the messages that
appear on a topic and either quietly making sense of what
is happening or actively engaging with those people to try
to influence their opinions. The single user price is out of
my reach for an annual commitment, though I might keep it up
for another month if I can find a specific task that warrants
the extra tooling.</p>

<p>My first test with any social software is to point it at a domain
that I know (Ann Arbor) and see what it unearths. Little Bird
found for me 1000 influential accounts having to do with Ann Arbor,
and in a boost to my ego it puts me in the top 50. Without understanding
how the algorithms work it seems that it biases towards identifying
busy accounts that post a lot of news, vs. the clever individual
whose every post is good but who doesn&rsquo;t post that often.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a style of posting which I would have to describe as
&ldquo;thinkfluential&rdquo; which Little Bird has a nose for. The thinkfluencer
will post frequently on a given topic, and a lot of people will
retweet them and they will retweet a lot of people. Every message
is relentlessly on message and you won&rsquo;t find cat pictures or
meeting banter mixed in. More often than not you&rsquo;ll see the
thinkfluence augmented by robots that post newsy things day and
night, even when the thinkfluencer is away from the keyboard.
There doesn&rsquo;t even need to be any interaction at all with this
&ldquo;expert&rdquo;, just a never-ending confluence of thinkfluence.</p>

<p>So I wish that Little Bird had another round of filters, to help me
understand the question at scale &ldquo;is this person really a bot&rdquo;.
The real utility for me of identifying expertise is not to pick
out the high-frequency posting bot, but to suss out who on a topic
is good at engaging on the things they know about. Bot identification
is the Turing Test at work, and maybe just maybe there&rsquo;s a set of
computable metrics that you can build across a corpus of Twitter
users to pull that out.</p>

      <p>Out for a bike ride to Malletts Creek Branch Library after a delicious lunch of
BBQ at Ricewood.</p>

<hr/>

<p>One of the challenges of low overhead custom postcard making is getting
an image manipulation pipeline that kicks out photos that a appropriately
cropped and sized. The latest challenge is identifying the single command
line that will turn a photo from my phone&rsquo;s camera into an appropriately
sized image for the card with a minimum of cropping, distortion, and
manual file transfers.</p>

<p>What I know doesn&rsquo;t work is upload via Twitter, because the series of
resizings generate visible compression artifacts.</p>

<p>I can upload from the phone to OneDrive, which gives me a photo of size
2592 × 1456 pixels (1.78:1, 16:9). The target size is 1875 x 1275
(1.47:1, 25:17), which is postcard format. I can keep all of the pixels
in the image by letterboxing it, or I can crop off the edges. What I
can&rsquo;t really do is stretch the image to fit because it&rsquo;s too far off.</p>

<p>Looking further at my camera software (Lumia Camera) it appears
that I can also take photos at 4:3. There&rsquo;s more experimenting to be done.</p>

<p>For more documentation, see <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/efficient-image-resizing-with-imagemagick/">Efficient Image Resizing With ImageMagick</a>,
Dave Newton in Smashing Magazine, June 25, 2015. Dave goes through a
professionally thorough view of resizing and resampling images for the web,
comparing his results against Photoshop. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested 31 different settings for <code>-filter</code> and got the best results
with <code>Triangle</code>. The Triangle resampling filter is also known as
bilinear interpolation, which I discussed above. It determines pixel
color by looking at a support area of neighboring pixels and produces
a weighted average of their colors. I found it best to specify this
support area at two pixels using the <code>-define filter:support=2</code>
setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dave uses DSSIM from <a href="https://pornel.net/dssim">https://pornel.net/dssim</a> to test his results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This tool computes (dis)similarity between two PNG images using
(my approximation of) algorithms approximating human vision.
Comparison is done in L<em>a*b</em> color space using a multi-scale variant
of the SSIM algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are sites that have automatic crop algorithms, though I haven&rsquo;t
yet found a package that&rsquo;s usable without licensing. The interactive
web site of <a href="http://croppola.com/">Croppola</a> is one useful example of
this genre.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I hope to see you at Docker Detroit&rsquo;s kickoff meeting, to be held
at RIIS, 1250 Stephenson Highway, Suite 200 in Troy, MI starting
at 6:00 p.m. tonight July 22 2015.  I&rsquo;ll be coming in from Ann
Arbor. The venue is between 14 Mile and Maple behind Beaumont Hospital.
Google Maps suggests that because of construction on I-75 in that
area you might want to head north on Campbell instead of taking
the I-75 / I-696 interchange north.</p>

<p>Leading the meeting tonight is Pepijn Bruienne from the University
of Michigan. He will be speaking about &ldquo;Docker in production&rdquo;
and organizing a group discussion with Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Detroit/events/223111645/">meetup announcement</a>
for more details, refreshments will be provided.</p>

<p>The meetup is hosted at <a href="http://www.riis.com">RIIS</a> a boutique web
and mobile development house. Hope to see you there!  I&rsquo;ll be taking
notes and plan to do a writeup of the event, as well as sharing my
own experiences running Docker for ARM on a Raspberry PI 2.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>At Roos, an espresso over ice with a little half and half and a hard
boiled egg. It&rsquo;s a very compact breakfast. The espresso is served in
an appropriately sized glass mug and tastes like the strongest little
iced latte you will ever have.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On my Mac, run &lsquo;boot2docker upgrade&rsquo;. That gets me up to current 1.7.1
revision of everything.</p>

<pre><code>Edwards-MacBook-Air:~ emv$ docker version
Client version: 1.7.1
Client API version: 1.19
Go version (client): go1.4.2
Git commit (client): 786b29d

Server API version: 1.19
Go version (server): go1.4.2
Git commit (server): 786b29d
OS/Arch (server): linux/amd64
</code></pre>

<p>The issue that 1.7.1 resolves for me is certificate support - if I
understand the bug right, the Docker daemon was creating a key for
each interface it had, but not all of the interfaces were up at key
init time. The fix was to move DHCP init earlier in the start sequence
so that everything was initialized by the time key creation took place.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Docker team is trying to improve code quality by having their
code base pass the <code>golint</code> test. The open issue,
<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/14784">fix golint errors/warnings #14784</a>,
has attracted a swarm of contributors, and a lot of them have
proposed changes that don&rsquo;t pass the automated tests. The build
farm is managed with Jenkins, and you can see the
<a href="https://jenkins.dockerproject.org/">status of every build of Docker</a> on their
dashboard.</p>

<p>Having a full lintable codebase is a great goal. The challenge comes when
the suggested changes by lint send you in the direction of making an
incompatible change to some interface that has the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; name but that
people were relying on.</p>

<p>Perhaps importantly for the work I&rsquo;m doing it&rsquo;s worth noting that currently
all of these tests are done on x86 platforms (Linux and Windows) and there
isn&rsquo;t an official automated build on ARM. I&rsquo;ve been using the
<a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/">Docker distribution from Hypriot</a> as my
baseline for working on the Raspberry Pi, with good success.</p>

<p>Construction on I-75 at 13 Mile Road! <a href="http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20150715/traffic-delays-expected-for-6-weeks-on-i-75-and-13-mile-during-mdot-project">Expect major delays</a> at this
project in Madison Heights. From the Oakland Press</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the construction project, there will be lane closures on both I-75 and 13 Mile Road in Madison Heights, said Diane Cross, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Transportation, which is doing the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(insert map here)</p>

<p>None of the alternative routes look any good, allow extra time for travel.</p>

<hr />

<p>Components of the postcard project are coming together. So far I have little
pieces that put and get addresses from a database, resize pictures to the
correct size, and generate test and live cards.</p>

<p>If I lob a single thoughtful card out every time I have an espresso, there
will be some steady stream of cards going out. Next piece of the checklist is
pulling a report showing which cards are in flight and which ones just arrived
so that I can schedule followups.</p>

<p>One of the key bits of sending cards is that your recipient doesn&rsquo;t get them
right away. That gives you a chance to refine your thinking and contemplate
what you have to say when you do follow up when they do get it.</p>

      <p>A productive afternoon with Mohan Kartha in which I opened a great
many tabs in Chrome. This bit of writing to close those out. Elixir
Vitae is a great spot for writing - lots of quiet noise from the coolers
to keep a background hum, and close to the bus station.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorting out the simplest task that I&rsquo;d like to do with Node-RED,
now that I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running it under Docker in a configuration
that&rsquo;s reliable enough that it seems like it&rsquo;s stable. The easiest
network test in the world is the ping test, and so my first stab at
a try for &ldquo;run always&rdquo; is a simple configuration to notice when the
network looks like it&rsquo;s down and when it is to collect some more
detailed information and log it to a file.</p>

<p>The inspiration for that is this simple configuration from an idea
by Nathan Chantrell, implemented by Martin Harizanov in 2014.
<a href="https://harizanov.com/2014/03/presence-detection-using-phones-wifi-and-node-red/">Presence detection using phone’s WiFi and Node-RED</a> relies on static
IP address assignments from DHCP, plus &ldquo;ping&rdquo;, to notice if

of a wifi signal is not an unambiguous marker!</p>

<p>My first pass at writing code to send postcards from Lob.com is
working. The note to self is that if you have a square bracket in
a URL, that you have to turn off curl&rsquo;s globbing function, e.g.
with -g or &ndash;globoff. &ldquo;When you set this option, you can specify
URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being
interpreted by curl itself. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Every card has a tracking code, so the next bit of reporting to write
is to see which cards are awaiting printing, which ones are in transit,
where they are going to and whether they have been received.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The AAATA moved the endpoint URL for its old-school &ldquo;classic&rdquo;
mobile RideTrak application. To go to a particular route like
the 5, see e.g. <a href="http://mobile.theride.org/classic/rideguide_m.asp?route=5">http://mobile.theride.org/classic/rideguide_m.asp?route=5</a> .
The main <a href="http://mobile.theride.org">http://mobile.theride.org</a> has a newer interface, but
alas my Windows Phone 8.1 with its Internet Explorer browser
doesn&rsquo;t do that page justice. (That, and I prefer the old interface
because I managed to figure it out for the stop I&rsquo;m always catching
the bus from.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering what the best approach is to the task of
&ldquo;download all of my email from Gmail&rdquo;, since the storage I
now have available on my laptop would make it straightforward
to have an 18 GB personal mail spool and because I really actually
would love to search through it so that I can mark some messages
for permanent deletion. One possibility is <a href="https://www.enkive.org">Enkive</a>

<hr/>

<p>I am reminded that I want to carry around a set of headphones with me
that plug into my Nokia 635 so that I can use the phone as a radio,
and also reminded that I want to try to construct a headphone dipole
as an antenna for my NooElec DVB-T tuner. The challenge will be remembering
those desires at the right time so that when I see the parts I need
in the junk pile at home that I can grab what I need for my every
day carry bag.</p>

<p>Oh, and I need to track down an 8 GB USB stick to load a boot ISO on.</p>

<p>The work of the morning is finishing up yesterday&rsquo;s work on sending
postcards with Lob.com. Key to this effort is resizing your favorite
images so that they meet the template. Fortunately I had the presence
of mind seven years ago to
<a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-29-image-processing-on-the-mac-with-sips-imagemagick-watching-dte-restore-power-slowly/">write up my notes on using sips and Imagemagick</a>
for image manipulation and that helped. In this case the magic incantation
was</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">sips -z 1275 1875 original.jpg --out new.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Mac, or want to do this on a server or container
somewhere, you&rsquo;ll want Imagemagick. That venerable program has a
bazillion options, and you&rsquo;ll find the image geometry options at
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry">http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry</a> .
Recreating this exact sips command is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<hr />

<p>That bit of image processing taken care of, the next iteration is to
launch a few actual postcards into the ether. After having confirmed
that everything goes OK on the test key, I sent out four cards. Estimated
delivery date is July 30, so I&rsquo;m expecting about a two week turnaround
for feedback that I got everything right. Lob has card tracking so I guess
the next step is to write the simple tools to know when things were
delivered so that I can plan some phone calls.</p>

<p>My cousin Zorba has perhaps the best bio in the business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has, in the course of his endeavors: been shot at by Navajos
in Utah; seized and threatened at knifepoint by rednecks in Arkansas;
chased by AK-47-toting soldiers in Hungary; run out of town by the
Penitentes in Truchas; shaken down by the Federales in Baja, and
forced to be rude to secure a cab in Rome. He has hung out of and
over: planes, balloons, helicopters, boats, rafts, race cars,
elevator shafts, too tall cliffs, and real deep canyons- and yet,
he still has enthusiasm and a good attitude.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jerry Davis asks why we still have academic journals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Web has greatly reduced the barriers to entry for new journals
and other platforms for communicating scientific output, and the
number of journals continues to multiply. This leaves readers and
authors with the daunting cognitive challenge of navigating the
literature and discerning contributions that are both relevant and
significant. Meanwhile, measures of journal impact that might guide
the use of the literature have become more visible and consequential,
leading to “impact gamesmanship” that renders the measures increasingly
suspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The essay, published in <a href="http://asq.sagepub.com/content/59/2/193">Administrative Science Quarterly</a> in June 2014, has the seeds of its own answer. Journals
exist to enrich academic publishers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pay per Article - You may purchase this article for US$32.00. You
must download your purchase, which is yours to keep, within 24
hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just ask Jerry for a preprint.</p>

<p>Previously (1995!) I get quoted in the Times Higher Education Supplement.
The debate then centered around Stevan Harnad, an open access journal
advocate who saw clearly the trend towards low cost electronic publications,
thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It remains only to tally up these PostGutenberg values: If the
world&rsquo;s esoteric scholarly/scientific literature were available to
everyone for free in electronic form, the first benefit to the
author would be the great increase in the visibility, accessibility
and hence the potential impact of his work (1). This would of course
also be a benefit to all scholars when they are wearing their
readers&rsquo; rather than their authors&rsquo; hats (2). Some fear that such
a literature would be overwhelming and un-navigable, but stop and
think: How do we currently manage it in paper? If the entire corpus
were transferred to the Net, instead of our eyes and fingers and
feet doing the walking to get to the papers or to get the papers
to us, electronic directories containing everything could be searched
using the kinds of keyword search already used today in searching
electronic databases that contain the titles and abstracts (but not
the articles) in the paper literature. Then, one more click, and
you have the paper itself! Or clever &ldquo;knowbots&rdquo; (automatic search
programmes) could be designed to go out instead of us and look for
papers fitting our profile of interests, leaving us even more time
to actually read what we want and to do our research, rather than
running after the literature.</p>

<p>There are two institutions that went by the name of GopherCon.
(No, it&rsquo;s not a furry convention; that&rsquo;s Anthrocon.) One was
from the early 1990s surrounding the Gopher internet browsing
protocol; the other is for enthusiasts and programmers of the
Go programming language. I am not aware of anyone who can claim
to have gone to both events.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.databaseteam.org/10-database/0722cf77b51ab4ba.htm">GopherCon 1995</a>
featured discussion of GopherVR and VRML for virtual reality in Gopher,
the Hyper-G Information System for hypertext authoring, and an
early morning session on Integrating Gopher and WWW.</p>

<p>GopherCon 2015 was in early July in Colorado. Of the items on
the agenda this talk by Barak Michener was perhaps the most interesting
to follow through on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Written in Go, Cayley is a graph database based on technology
behind Freebase.com. Starting with a short history of the inspirations
behind Cayley, this talk will deep-dive into the moving parts of
building a graph database, between the various query languages, the
storage engines, and the iterator trees.</p>

<p>And of course this blog is now powered by Hugo which is written in Go
so I&rsquo;m learning a little about the Go template language as a side effect.</p>

I&rsquo;ll take it all the way to the end of its route.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>It&rsquo;s a warm but pleasant mid-summer late Monday morning, and I&rsquo;m
visiting the first cafe inbound on a walk to town. Biggby Packard
is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so.</p>

<p>Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&rsquo;s not really enough here
to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people
from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus.
I&rsquo;ve been in here before when I was the only patron for more than
an hour but this morning there&rsquo;s a few more people sitting typing.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I first ran into the &ldquo;pocketmod&rdquo; planning technique in 2005, and
here it is 10 years later and there&rsquo;s one in my pocket.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pocketmod is a cleverly folded piece of paper with preprinted
templates for things like a mini calendar, todo list, quadrille
paper, checklist etc. It&rsquo;s the smallest instance of a PDA that I
have seen yet, requiring nothing more than a blank piece of paper
and a pair of scissors to execute. You could even bypass the scissors
if you had good paper and a crisp straightedge to do a rip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Astoundingly, <a href="http://www.pocketmod.com/">http://www.pocketmod.com/</a> is still online, in all of
its 2005-2007 glory. That system does an 8-up PDF from a set of templates,
so that you can print a lovingly detailed mini booklet. My own use
has long since devolved into scrap paper plus rip down the center.
When it fills up, invert the fold, and you have a brand new organizer.</p>

<p>Now playing, Johnny Cash&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Piece at a Time&rdquo;. &ldquo;GM wouldn&rsquo;t miss just
one little piece.&rdquo; Look for the promo photo.</p>

<p>Menu plan: green beans with walnuts and miso sauce, plus a few green beans
uncooked on the side for J who likes to eat the raw. A recipe of sorts is
at <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-review-green-beans-with-49874">The Kitchn</a>,
which refers to a 2005 New York Times Dining article about Yumiko
Kano and her brand of Japanese cooking.
<a href="http://justbento.com/handbook/bento-basics/review-saisai-lunch-vegan-bento-by-yumiko-kano">Just Bento</a> has some reviews of books by Yumiko Kano (aka Yumiko Kanoh or
Kanou Kumiko). <a href="http://theunbearablelightnessofbeinghungry.com/2009/10/vegetarian-ramen/">The Unbearable Lightness of Being Hungry</a> has a 2009 vegetarian ramen recipe
from the same author. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://metropolis.co.jp/dining/table-talk/yumiko-kano/">profile of Yumiko Kano</a> in Metropolis.</p>

<p>We got some
very yummy new potatoes from Farmers Market that I cooked up last night,
which were 1000x more wonderful than storebought old potatoes.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Exit Biggby heading north to North Campus to Mujo&rsquo;s, for some
time spent writing. Close all of the windows, save all of the
documents, publish locally all of the works in progress. North
Campus has the virute of frequent free bus service from Central
Campus, and it&rsquo;s far enough away to completely flush all of
the thoughts of what I had been doing so I can work on another project.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-lob-a-postcard-printer/">lob a postcard: printer sends cards via API</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Lob.com has an API to send postcards-as-a-service ($0.70 per each,
full custom both sides). Details at <a href="https://lob.com/services/postcards">https://lob.com/services/postcards</a> .
It works, but all of the user interface is up to you; if you know
a good service for delivering a single full-custom postcard with
postage that actually has a user interface and not an API for less
than $1.00 each, let me know and I&rsquo;ll update here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started checking in a few tiny utility programs that exercise
the Lob API. Look for <a href="https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard">https://github.com/vielmetti/postcard</a> on Github.
The goal at some point is to have a &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; application
that has a user interface like so.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">postcard --to mom --photo cute-kids.jpg --message &quot;they get so big so fast! love ed&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Also in this business is PostalMethods with a Postcard API based on SOAP.
That&rsquo;s not a convenient interface in the languages that I use, but you
can look at the API at <a href="http://www.postalmethods.com/lp/postcard-api">http://www.postalmethods.com/lp/postcard-api</a> .
Their prices for postcards run $1.50 per each or less, with quantity
discounts - see <a href="http://www.postalmethods.com/pricing">http://www.postalmethods.com/pricing</a> for details.</p>

<p>Postful used to have an API for postcards. They were
<a href="http://blog.click2mail.com/articles/view/click2mail-acquires-postful/">bought by Click2Mail in 2011</a>. Pricing for Click2Mail&rsquo;s postcards starts at $0.25
per card plus $0.284 postcard, but there&rsquo;s a $2.00 minimum if
you don&rsquo;t have credits on account. I wasn&rsquo;t able to determine
at first glance whether their REST API applied to onesy-twoesy
printing options, though it was clear that if you wanted to send
1000 cards that the pricing would be competitive.</p>
