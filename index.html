<ul>
<li>Test integration (and maybe publishing too) with <code>travis</code></li>
<li>Acceptance tests with <code>bats</code></li>
<li>Auto-discovery for RSS feed, per <a href="http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/">http://gohugo.io/templates/rss/</a></li>
<li>Short codes for easy linking. First pass complete.
Assisted synaesthesia and colorized names and phrases.
(Started, with colorized but not linked names)</li>
<li>Nicely thought through category and taxonomy pages. They
have stubs now, but they need design.
and it should integrate with Arborwiki. (Started.)</li>
<li>Links from books to their corresponding URLs and ISBNs to
link to AADL and Amazon pages, perhaps with Librarything data</li>
<li>Pagination with group by date, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Fix problem with dots in taxonomy names, coming in 0.15</li>
<li>Some kind of database driven page data, in preparation
for rolling out a power outage maps collection based on DOE EIA data,
cf <a href="http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/">http://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the theme is in version control, which means
I have to learn about git subtrees.</li>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-ann-arbor-writing-escapes/">Ann Arbor quiet writing escapes</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Where to go in Ann Arbor to do some quiet writing, without distractions.
There are plenty of cafes where there are lots of people around; this
list looks for the empty places where you won&rsquo;t have your attention broken
quite so easily.</p>

<p>This is a much easier task in the summer time than it is during the school
year, as the students thin out and University buildings are much quieter.</p>

<p>Central Campus:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rackham.umich.edu/rackham-building/study-halls">Rackham Building reading rooms</a>, second floor. Very lovely, very quiet, recommended by many.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/hatcher-graduate-library/carrels-hatcher-graduate-library">Hatcher Graduate Library study carrels</a>, especially on the higher floors. You&rsquo;ll have a little room of your own.</li>
<li>Law Library reading room.</li>
<li>Michigan League, upper floors</li>
<li>Museum of Art</li>
<li>Palmer Commons, where the upper floors have writing desks</li>
<li>Social Work Library</li>
</ul>

<p>Downtown:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann Arbor City Hall, council chambers (not during a meeting)</li>
<li>Sweetwaters, Liberty or Washington St</li>
<li>Ann Arbor District Library, third floor (periodicals) or fourth floor (administration)</li>
<li>Zingerman&rsquo;s Next Door, upstairs in one of the smaller rooms</li>
<li>Mighty Good Coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>North side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matthaei Botanical Gardens</li>
<li>Duderstadt Center library, second floor (periodicals)</li>
</ul>

<p>South side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ann Arbor Municipal Airport</li>
<li>Roos Roast</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, external distractions are only one part of the complex question of
&ldquo;why are no words appearing on the page&rdquo;. There are some a few tricks that I
use to minimize distractions coming from the computer itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write in a big &lsquo;vim&rsquo; window. Open up Terminal, maximize a window,
and then fire up &lsquo;vim&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m managing to get 62 lines on the screen without
having to squint, and the browser is not on the screen.</li>
<li>Go offline. If your writing environment allows, do your writing without
a connection to the Internet.</li>
<li>If you must stay online, mute notifications. On my Mac that&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;Do not disturb&rdquo; setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a big screen up another functional way to avoid a distraction
is to keep sitting until the screen is full. It&rsquo;s not necessary to
actually want to keep all of the words that you write - it&rsquo;s OK to
discard some of them in a subsequent editing session - but the self
imposed constraint to fill the page all the way to the bottom on a 62
line screen produces a substantial quantity of work in a single sitting.</p>

<p>A useful quality to cultivate is &ldquo;sitzfleisch&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Germans have aptly called Sitzfleisch the ability to spend endless hours at a desk doing grueling work. Sitzfleisch is considered by mathematicians to be a better guage of success than any of the attractive definitions of talent with which psychologists regale us from time to time.  Gian-Carlo Rota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pull up a seat, open up the screen, start typing. Don&rsquo;t look up until the page is full.
Set yourself a time limit and a word count and aim for that. The time limit can
be enforced by parking in a space where your time is limited, which reminds
me that I must be going.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-25-a-commonplace-reader/">A commonplace reader</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier and faster to fill a page by quoting from others.</p>

<p>The commonplace book is the annotated scrapbook, carefully collecting
bits from other writers with just enough commentary and selection to
make them your own. If these were written in this era you&rsquo;d call it
&ldquo;curation&rdquo;, though I can only think of that word in the context of
&ldquo;curated meats&rdquo;, somewhat salty and dry and meant to be preserved for
some time.</p>

<p>Anyway, the commonplace book. Why write your own words, when there are
so many other good ones already written to quote from? As it is said,
though <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/">no attribution is reliable</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Immature artists copy, great artists steal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The artist steal from tonight is Brian Eno, in particular his <a href="http://oblicard.com/">Oblique Strategies</a>,
which I now have as three lines of shell script plus 128 lines of text. A sample, intended
to be drawn at random:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not building a wall but making a brick</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to brick-machines, this from Popular Science</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bricks are fairly easy to make, but in the developing world, traditional fired bricks are sometimes weak and crumble-prone, while cement ones are often unaffordable. The Vermeer BP714 is the first compressed-earth-block machine that makes strong air-dried bricks out of dirt. Its bricks don&rsquo;t just exceed U.S. cement-code strength requirements—they&rsquo;re 20 to 30 percent stronger, and cheaper than other machines&rsquo; too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that&rsquo;s the story you want to tell when someone else
has a lot of mud and you have a lot of machine.</p>

<p>The commonplace style of writing allows you to fill a page
with text faster, since you&rsquo;re cutting and pasting it in
rather than sweating to find the exact words yourself. The
downside is that you might sometimes have to hunt for the
correct word, and it will be obvious that it&rsquo;s someone
else&rsquo;s correct word. There is no question of plagiarism,
just of assembly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The serious crimes in terms of writing are that of plagiarism and copyright violation. (Reality Studio)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So long as we are going down this route, it&rsquo;s worth rejecting
plagiarism as a thought-crime. From Kenneth Goldsmith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems an appropriate response to a new condition in writing: With an unprecedented amount of available text, our problem is not needing to write more of it; instead, we must learn to negotiate the vast quantity that exists. How I make my way through this thicket of information—how I manage it, parse it, organize and distribute it—is what distinguishes my writing from yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make patchworks. Most two word phrases can be easily found on the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most two-word phrases are not produced under unpleasant stress, but in interest or excitement. (Penelope Leach, &ldquo;Babyhood&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The important thing is to provide the reader with enough information so that the article can be easily found on the References page. (Communication Research Methods in Postmodern Culture)</p>

<p>Lists of real-world materials and their refractive indexes are easily found on the Internet.  (Lanier, &ldquo;Maya Studio Projects Texturing and Writing&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retroactively we can construct some level of patchwork that we can crib from, in interest or excitement.</p>

      <h3>
      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-24-zingermans-coffee/">At Zingermans Coffee for an afternoon of writing</a>
      </h3>
      <p>A daily coffee and wifi report.</p>

<p>At times I get frustrated by my ability to sit down and produce words on a page.
The challenge is not to keep going once I get going, but in the very act of
getting started.</p>

<p>I do best at writing when I have a prompting question that allows me
to go on and on at least to get to the point where the screen is full
and ready to be edited down to size. The prompt doesn&rsquo;t have to be
the words that eventually get onto the page; it&rsquo;s at least as likely
that you discover what you sat down to do only <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way down
the screen, and then&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s time to shuffle the page around to save
what&rsquo;s savable and refocus what you had dealt with into a smaller spot.</p>

<p>Prompting questions are fun (and hard). I once wrote for AnnArbor.com, a
semi-lovable job which was equal parts delight and horror. The delight
was that the prompt only was to keep the phrase &ldquo;Ann Arbor&rdquo; in the first
paragraph. The horror was the task of reading all of the comments
on all of the stories written. Since then, I never read the comments.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be distracted while writing in such a way that the start
never happens. Deadlines and word counts have a way of sharpening the
mind, and that helps. The trick is to realize that you have to trick
yourself sometimes into starting, and once the words start to flow
it is not so difficult.</p>

<p>First, there&rsquo;s all of the other windows that you might have open that have
little bubbles protesting that you can&rsquo;t close them until you empty out
that bubble. I don&rsquo;t want to count how many alternative rounded rectangles there
are hiding on-screen that all demand some measure of attention. It&rsquo;s
not just that there are non-zero numbers on the inbox, that&rsquo;s normal;
it&rsquo;s also that every other communications channel seems to be wide open.
To close them you either deal with the system or ignore it.</p>

<p>Next of course since it&rsquo;s Zingerman&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s almost always someone
I know to reacquiaint myself with, or someone I don&rsquo;t know to be
introduced to. I&rsquo;m not sure how they managed to make a non-descript
entrance in an industrial park into Grand Central Station, but they
did, and I appreciate the effort.</p>

<p>Finally there&rsquo;s the notifications coming from various systems - Slack,
or Facebook, or email. I&rsquo;d be remiss in not suggesting to myself
that I shut them off, but they persist, and because they are handy
sometimes I let myself get noise in the upper right hand corner of the
screen.</p>

<p>Of late the &ldquo;screen is full&rdquo; challenge has gotten harder, since I&rsquo;m
using as big a text window to type into as I can - 60+ lines tall, and
more than 200 characters wide. A 500 word essay fits in one column
of that page and can easily be seen on a single screen. Divide the
screen in two, and 1000 words come to view. What you can do when
the whole argument comes into sharp focus, and you can see that the
excuses that you are making in the middle of it don&rsquo;t need to be there.</p>

<p>Bots are hot today in part because natural langauge processing
has improved to the point where <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html">Google can build hardware</a>
to speed up their software algorithms and run their immense
training corpuses through it quickly to fine tune their approach.
The output of this effort is ASICs that speed up their <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a>
algorithm for machine learning. Thus Google can safely give away
their software, knowing that anyone else running it will use
a multiple of the energy that it takes Google to do it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s instructive to look at the changes throughout the years and
how bots have co-evolved with the networks and computer systems
that they inhabit. Early AIs like ELIZA and PARRY lived on
mainframes connected to very slow wide-area networks, and it
was years before the two of them talked to each other online.
The 1980s and 1990s brought Usenet and the automation that could
live on store-and-forward networks. AOL Instant Messenger&rsquo;s
ubiquitous chat met popular culture and the emergence of
advertising bots like GooglyMinotaur, which promoted the music
of Radiohead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing what I think is some kind of manuscript about
bots and their personalities, a biographical dictionary of
emerging intelligences. I&rsquo;m at about 10,000 words. It&rsquo;s a challenge
to try to corral that much quasi-intelligence onto the page, including
trying as best I can to characterize some systems that are
known only by people&rsquo;s memories of them.</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-05-01-three-column-writing-style/">Three column writing style</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The elements of a three column writing style:</p>

<p>There is a broad center, with sidebars left and right.</p>

<p>The left sidebar is labelled &ldquo;Do&rdquo;, and it contains a
record of the things that were done; sit in a chair,
drink a cup of coffee, do laundry between writing bits,
make the bed.</p>

<p>The right sidebar contains snippets or longer of things
that were read, since you are expected when writing to
have reading materials nearby to crib from or to be
inspired by. Tonight I have the Taschen postcardbook &ldquo;Barkitecture&rdquo;,
and a postcard from Syracuse Cultural Workers on
&ldquo;How to create community&rdquo;, to guide me along.</p>

<p>This leaves the middle main column for thoughts, impressions;
&ldquo;writing&rdquo;, not that the other bits are any fewer words on
the page.</p>

<p>The challenge overall is how to represent this on the
computer screen. When you write in this style, the page
can be read top to bottom or left to right or in any
diagonal direction, and it will still make some sense.
Short of typing words into cells of a spreadsheet, or
composing in a monospaced font with exact word counts,
it&rsquo;s hard to recreate precisely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked writing in the sidebar, sometimes more
so than the writing in the middle. Quadrille paper helps
to keep the margins aligned.</p>

<p>(Note that the blogging format is essentailly a one-column
style with some static sidebars, and I have never managed
to compose anything suitable that really captures my notebooks.)</p>

      <a href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-04-25-hidden-water-flush-maps/">Ann Arbor hydrant flushing maps</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The City of Ann Arbor has maps showing you where the hydrants
are being flushed. If your water turns brown, the most likely
cause of it is sediment being disturbed by hydrant flush tests.
Run your cold water for a bit until it clears. If it doesn&rsquo;t
clear promptly, call the city. A secondary source of sediment
is unexpected water main breaks.</p>

<p>It is possible to get notified of hydrant flushing in your
neighborhood, but it&rsquo;s not easy. The city sends out an email
through GovDelivery alerting you that there is hydrant flushing
somewhere in the city:</p>

<p>Routine fire hydrant flushing continues in Ann Arbor next week, April 25-29, 2016.</p>

<p>That email contains a link to a news release at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.a2gov.org/news/pages/article.aspx?i=252">http://www.a2gov.org/news/pages/article.aspx?i=252</a></p>

<p>which doesn&rsquo;t say anything about where the flushing is going to take
place, except to say that there&rsquo;s a map. You click on
the page that says there&rsquo;s a map</p>

<p><a href="http://www.a2gov.org/departments/field-operations/Pages/hydrantflush.aspx">http://www.a2gov.org/departments/field-operations/Pages/hydrantflush.aspx</a></p>

<p>and it reiterates that there&rsquo;s a map, and one more click hopefully
finally connects you to the map itself</p>

<p><a href="http://www.a2gov.org/annarborhydflush">http://www.a2gov.org/annarborhydflush</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s three clicks to get to the page, with no hints anywhere
along the way about where the hydrant flushing actually is.</p>

<p>If there were ever a reason to put in an embedded map on any
of these pages, it would be that people are unlikely to click
through three times just in case their neighborhood is affected.</p>

slave whose skin is the colour of the earth and whose innards are

imagine that it is possible to obtain slave like labour from inanimate
machines. Yet, although technology can store or amplify labour, it
can never remove the necessity for humans to invent, build and
maintain these machines in the first place. Slave labour cannot be
obtained without somebody being enslaved.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m taking a temporary break from Facebook.</p>

<p>You probably won&rsquo;t read this message in time to switch any of your
normal communciations paths with me; indeed, unless I had told you
that I was leaving Facebook idle for a while you wouldn&rsquo;t notice at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d prefer it if more people were blogging, and more to the point if
I were blogging more. I miss the olden days when you could count on
people updating their blogs more than once a month and when it made
sense to make the rounds of blogrolls. But I suppose that&rsquo;s just
net.nostalgia for the olden days, the same way you might say that
Flickr was better the first few years, and oh we don&rsquo;t have anything
quite like the Napster that we once had.</p>

<p>What we do have is Facebook, and plenty of it. A recent story somewhere
that I read somewhere (see, this media makes our brains mush) was that
people with Facebook accounts are dying, and that the Facebook we know
now will be dominated some time soon by memorials to the dead.</p>

<p>Faced with that grim promise, what to do instead? Twitter is my
solace, the endless stacatto chatter punctuated by weird Unicode
glyphs, with cryptic tendencies and self-contained non-sequiturs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taking a break. How can you tell? I&rsquo;m writing again. I don&rsquo;t
write on Facebook, so much as scroll endlessly and leave little
obscure comments made out of mostly-remembered lyrics.</p>

      <p>Roos Roast is adding a downtown Ann Arbor location, due to open
spring of 2016. The roastery on Rosewood will expand to a
second location on E Liberty St, where Elixir Vitae used to be.
Elixir will keep its Maynard St store open.</p>

<p>The interior construction in the store is going well,
as far as it&rsquo;s possible to determine from looking at
the permit process and poking my head inside the door.
So far the following permits have
been pulled, according to the city&rsquo;s eTrakit system:</p>

<p>BLDG16-0317 for demolition in the existing site, approved
3/7/2016</p>

<p>ELEC16-0449 for internal electrical wiring, approved 4/18/2016;
work by <a href="http://www.bremray.com/">Bremray Electrical</a></p>

<p>HDC16-062 to the Historic District Commission for a sign,
applied 4/18/2016</p>

<p>PLUM16-0551 for plumbing, work by Chelsea Plumbing</p>

<p><a href="http://etrakit.a2gov.org/etrakit3/viewAttachment.aspx?Group=PERMIT&amp;ActivityNo=SIGN16-0050&amp;key=WMN%3a1604190852460942">SIGN16-0050</a>
for an aluminum sign showing a hand holding a
cup with the Roos Roast logo, applied 4/18/2016; the sign
review is due 5/5/2016. Sign by <a href="http://prototypedesigninc.com/">Prototype Design</a> in Tecumseh.</p>

<p>SOCC16-0024 for sidewalk occupancy, issued 4/21/2016.</p>

<p>The only piece of this process that looks like it could possibly go to
a public hearing is the Historic District Commission determination
of appropriateness of signage. If this were to be the case,
a large orange poster would go up in front of the store to
announce the meeting date.</p>

<p>A sign had been approved previously for the site in 2009 when the
storefront housed &ldquo;Organic Bliss&rdquo;; at that point there was no
requirement for anything more than staff approval of the signage.
AnnArbor.com&rsquo;s story about <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/business-review/organic-bliss-to-shut-down-blaming-downtown-ann-arbors-independent-retail-environment/">Organic Bliss closing in 2012</a> has a photo of the storefront at that time.</p>

      <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s radio was full of the Prince music catalog. The artist
passed away in his Minnesota home at the age of 57. In response
any radio station that had anything other that pre-programmed music
responded by playing his hits - &ldquo;Little Red Corvette&rdquo;, &ldquo;Raspberry Beret&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Purple Rain&rdquo; - and the radio stations that had artistic control
also played B sides, live shows, bootlegs and whatever they could find.
Ann Arbor&rsquo;s own WCBN was exemplary in this regard.</p>

<p>The radio that I remember is from the 80s when Prince&rsquo;s music was
in regular play on the Electrifyin&rsquo; Mojo&rsquo;s show on Detroit&rsquo;s WJLB.
Prince did a very rare live radio interview with Mojo, and you can
hear it in two parts - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJZCoxZ5COY">part one</a>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, MI, 17 April 2016: An earthquake hit near the coast of
Ecuador on the evening of 16 April 2016. As of 1:00 p.m. Eastern
time the current estimate is 235 killed and 1,557 wounded from the
incident. Reports are still coming in from the hardest hit areas
which lost telecommunications lines in the disaster, so expect these
numbers to increase.</p>

<p>Early reports from Ecuador came in
<a href="https://twitter.com/abenavidesgol/status/721506479866572800">primarily via social media</a>, as it took
a while for the nation&rsquo;s news organization to cut over to flash reporting
of the news from their regularly scheduled programs. The country&rsquo;s
vice president, <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeGlas">Jorge Glas</a>, provided
regular and authoritative reports on damage and emergency response.</p>

<p>Reporting on the damage was almost entirely in Spanish,
as there is no substantial English language media presence in the
county. I found the automated translation service provided by Bing
in the Twitter feed to be indispensible. Some words that you will
see over and over again:</p>

<ul>
<li>personas heridas = people injured</li>
<li>personas fallecidas = people killed</li>
<li>sin luz = without electricity</li>
<li>sismo, terremoto, temblor = earthquake</li>
</ul>

<p>For music and (sometimes) news from Ecuador, I turned to Tunein, which
relays thousands of radio stations worldwide. At various times the following
channels were interesting or informative:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Am%C3%A9rica-Estereo-%40Guayaquil%41-933-s68608/">Radio America Estereo, Guayaquil</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Radio-Quito-760-s59649/">Radio Quito, 760 AM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tunein.com/radio/Ecuador-Inmediato-Radio-s59648/">Ecuador Inmediato Radio, Quito</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I looked for the shortwave broadcast of <a href="http://radiohcjb.org/">HCJB</a> but
it would appear that its English language broadcasts are no more. There is
news in Spanish on the site under the <a href="http://radiohcjb.org/author/noticias/">Noticias</a> banner.</p>

<p>Some individual news feeds to follow from the time of the event:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/lewisshepherd">Lewis Shepherd</a>, Washington DC based analyst</li>

sitting down with nothing to say, as not sitting down at all.</p>

<p>Writing is hard work, and there&rsquo;s some natural inclination to gravitate
towards writing work that is paid for to make that hard work pay. On
the other hand there is some writing that will never be renumerative,
but that wants to be written anyway.</p>

<p>At some point I am sure I will eventually give up on blogging, but I
am reluctant to say that this is that week or month. Until then, the
minimalist goal is to produce something enough that no month goes
without some measure of content or discontent.</p>

      <p>The small experiment: post the smallest amount of text to two separate
social networks, see what the differences are.</p>

<p>As I might have expected, Twitter generated fewer responses, and Facebook
generated more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that there are any conclusions to be drawn that are useful,
as neither system is necessarily &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for individual messages in isolation.
It&rsquo;s the cumulative effect of being able to reach out to people that makes
some value of them both.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m working through the details of an upgrade from Mavericks to
El Capitan. Some running notes.</p>

<p>The upgrade took about 2 hrs. I went to the Apple Store at Briarwood
in Ann Arbor to get the install done, since their Internet is faster
than my home UVerse.</p>

<p>After doing the upgrade the next big slow task is <code>brew update</code>. You
would not be surprised to know that I have a lot of packages installed,
and that brew is working hard to update everything.</p>

<p>The biggest reason that I upgraded was to get <code>xhyve</code> and thus
Docker for Mac. I&rsquo;m using the beta now (beta 5) and have gotten
a few trivial things to work, but am still sorting out a few
questions which might or might not be issues.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The bids for the work came in higher than expected, so the
City of Ann Arbor&rsquo;s Ann Arbor Stadium Boulevard road
reconstruction project will likely omit the section between Main Street and Seventh.
That&rsquo;s the word from the city&rsquo;s engineer on the project, Michael Nearing, P.E.
He writes in an email sent from his iPhone on Saturday, Feb 13, 2016 at 1:26 PM:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point it appears that the only realistic option to perform the project with the funds that are available is to revise the project limits.  We are currently reviewing the plans, the planned work, our material choices, proposed construction methods, and the bid prices received to determine the most prudent course of action.</p>

<p>Once we better understand all the factors that will affect the work, we&rsquo;ll share the information with Council and the public of our revised course of action.</p>

<p>We are hopeful the we can re-bid the project later this year and start construction after the U of M Home Football season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Details on the city&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.a2gov.org/departments/engineering/Pages/Stadium-Blvd-Road-Reconstruction-Project.aspx">Stadium Boulevard Road Reconstruction Project</a> page do not yet reflect this new reality, and the

      <p>Saveur Magazine has a recipe for a <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Chicken-and-Onion-Curry">chicken and onion curry</a>
from January 27, 2010. It took a little more than an hour
to cook, but the results were very much worth it - delicious,
and worth repeating.</p>

<p>We had the meal with rice, kale, and a
<a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/radish-raita-57431">daikon raita</a> from
food.com that I kind of liked but which was not a big hit
with the rest of the table.</p>

<p>The current meal planning regime here uses a Google calendar
and a question at the end of every meal: do you want this again,
and how many weeks before we have it again? This curry will
repeat in 3 weeks.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 25 2016: The Ann Arbor Public Schools
issued this news release and letter to parents, signed by Superintendent
Jeanice Swift.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Monday, January 25, 2016</p>

<p>Dear AAPS Parents,</p>

<p>As many of you may have already heard, there have been threats made on social media to multiple school districts across the metro area, extending to Florida, and rumored to have occurred as far as California.</p>

<p>Please be assured that in the Ann Arbor Public Schools, we take any and all threats very seriously and consistently follow established emergency procedures in cooperation with Ann Arbor Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>We received information in the early morning hours that Ann Arbor was included in this social media situation.  Police were notified immediately and we have been actively working with the AAPD since first learning of this issue.</p>

<p>Our principals were advised early this morning of this situation, and we continue to work with law enforcement officials as part of our safety protocol. We will continue to monitor this situation very closely.</p>

<p>As the use of social media for posting threats against schools seems to be increasing, I would like to ask all parents to talk to their children about using social media and instruct them that if they see anything on social media that is a concern, to immediately report it to an adult, such as a parent, principal or teacher.  If they re-post or pass on the threat, they can also be held responsible for issuing a threat and can receive disciplinary action as a result.</p>

<p>Please be assured that we take every threat seriously as safety for our students and staff is our first priority.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Jeanice K. Swift, Ph.D.
Superintendent of Schools</p>
