      <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2015 I wrote briefly about &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-30-plane-spotting-some-quick-notes-on-a-new-software-defined-radio-setup/&#34;&gt;plane spotting with dump1090&lt;/a&gt;.
In short, many airplanes have ADS-B transponders which squawk out
their location, airspeed, and current conditions, and you can pick
up those transmissions using an inexpensive RTL-SDR tuner stick and
a simple antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into this again to see if I can get a better
understanding of how it works as well as to take advantage of a year plus
of software development. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the state of the art
circa July 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware: I&amp;rsquo;m using a Nooelec NESDR Mini 2 tuner stick plugged into a MacBook Air
as a portable plane-finding system. I have a Raspberry Pi 2 which looks
like it could be a permanent installation for this, though the recommendation
for busy skies is a Pi 3 which is enough faster to make a difference if you
have a good antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antenna: The Mini 2 comes with a small whip antenna with a magnetic base, and I&amp;rsquo;m borrowing
a larger antenna. There are scads of antenna designs out there for inexpensive
small antennas tuned to 1090 Mhz, but I&amp;rsquo;m not there yet. There are also
filters and amplifiers that can improve plane-finding capabilities; also not
there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software: Here&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;ve made progress. The dump1090 software has been
forked several times, each time with just a little bit more sophistication
on the visual display as well as refinements of the decoding system. The
one I&amp;rsquo;m using right now is a fork by &amp;ldquo;mutability&amp;rdquo;, available at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mutability/dump1090&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mutability/dump1090&lt;/a&gt; . It&amp;rsquo;s notable for being
designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, as well as a bunch of small changes
in the display that make it more pleasant to use than the older software
I had been using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range: Just like I reported back in 2015, the typical results from my
house are a range of 40-50 nautical miles in every direction. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
yet taken the rig to my favorite plane-spotting cafe &amp;ndash; the Biggby at
Platt and Ellsworth &amp;ndash; which has a clear view of the southern sky at
a good elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweaking the setup: Aside from changing out the hardware and relocating
the antenna, the tweakable changes seem to be adjusting the gain control
on the SDR. Initial experiments don&amp;rsquo;t give me strong conclusions as to
what&amp;rsquo;s best. The reviews of a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/ADS-B-1090MHz-Band-pass-SMA-Filter/dp/B010GBQXK8&#34;&gt;$20 band pass filter&lt;/a&gt; are
promising for increasing the range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding the data elsewhere: One of the collective efforts around looking for
airplanes is the ability to share the data with commerical and non-commericial
systems that aggregate data from around the world. I&amp;rsquo;m digging
&lt;a href=&#34;http://planefinder.net&#34;&gt;http://planefinder.net&lt;/a&gt; which has a nifty near-real-time feed of ADS-B
and FAA and other international data for tracking flights. Planefinder is
fast enough that I can hear an airplane overheard, check the display,
and figure out which flight is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellite plane finding: The &lt;a href=&#34;https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/gomx-3&#34;&gt;GOMX-3 satellite&lt;/a&gt;
has an SDR with ADS-B reception and has successfully
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.airtrafficmanagement.net/2016/07/fr24-completes-satbased-adsb-tracking/&#34;&gt;fed data to Flightradar24&lt;/a&gt;,
another commericial plane tracking system. ADS-B receivers are expected
to be installed on the Iridium system over the next couple of years,
which should over time provide improved global coverage and visibility
into the current status of aircraft over oceans and the poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it looks like: I don&amp;rsquo;t have a permanent installation running,
but if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the airspace above San Diego, you can
see Phil Karn KA9Q&amp;rsquo;s system at &lt;a href=&#34;http://maggie.ka9q.net:8080/dump1090/gmap.html&#34;&gt;http://maggie.ka9q.net:8080/dump1090/gmap.html&lt;/a&gt;
noting that he&amp;rsquo;s in easy range of picking traffic into LAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. Same form factor, bright blue in color, and the supplied antenna is a retractable whip with a magnetic base. As always it comes with no documentation and no software (you are expected to provide those).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously used a version of &#34;gqrx&#34; as a radio receiver, in a package that had been built for the Mac. This time I thought I&#39;d build from source. I went to the &#39;homebrew&#39; port system and found a version that said it worked for OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), but I&#39;m on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and the build didn&#39;t work (it crapped out in building scipy). Reading the documentation more closely the distribution says it&#39;s available through Macports, so I installed that and did &#34;sudo port install gnuradio&#34; and &#34;sudo port install gqrx&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macports is one of those amazing feats of modern software engineering where someone (or really a lot of people) have carefully and meticulously figured out how to take a package of source code and make it build, including tracing all of the dependencies upon which everything else needs to be built. For gqrx and GNU Radio this means (at the very bottom) that I had to have a working FORTRAN compiler so that I could compile the FORTRAN code hiding in the numerical analysis libraries. This brings me right back to the 1970s learning FORTRAN at Michigan Tech in their Summer Youth Program. I can&#39;t even imagine how old the code was that I compiled but it might actually date from then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything did build just fine, and then I had a radio. The first test is always to tune into WCBN, which came in with a strong signal, and to key up my ham radio transmitter via Echolink to make the W8UM repeater make some noise, and to get some weather radio going. Everything I tried worked just fine and passed with flying colors, the gqrx software is more modern than it once was in a couple of very helpful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was to grab one of the many versions of &#34;dump1090&#34; which uses the SDR radio to tune to aircraft ADS-B broadcasts that give you a version of aircraft radar. This also worked well, perhaps better than I could have expected. From home with an antenna in the middle of the house I could hear airplanes just north of Jackson, MI from Ann Arbor, MI (about 40 miles). I relocated to a cafe near the dog park (Ellsworth at Platt) that has a good view of the southern sky, and the same little bitty antenna pulled in reception from airplanes near Fort Wayne, IN (about 120 miles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s always more to try, of course. GNU Radio is a full toolkit for building your own radio design, complete with FM decoders and the like, and it has a fairly simple to understand user interface compared to how complex the underpinnings are (remember, FORTRAN). There&#39;s lots more software that uses the RTL-SDR libraries and even a port to the Raspberry Pi which I&#39;d like to try.&lt;/p&gt;
