      <description>Little Bird is a system that helps you discover influencers and experts in any topic. I&amp;rsquo;m at the very start of a 7 day trial. Marshall Kirkpatrick is CEO of Little Bird, and he has been active on Twitter posting interesting ideas about influence marketing - and given that it seemed prudent to give the product a try.
Pricing is aimed at agencies, not individuals, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at this product through the eyes of people doing &amp;ldquo;social listening&amp;rdquo; for a living, tracking the messages that appear on a topic and either quietly making sense of what is happening or actively engaging with those people to try to influence their opinions.</description>
