      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wakatime tracks your time if you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer. It does this by
integrating into your favorite text editor (including vim) and your
favorite source code maintainence system (including Github) and then
matching time spent editing with checkins into your system. It collects
stats behind the scenes and turns everything into a shiny dashboard.
&amp;ldquo;Fitbit for programmers&amp;rdquo; is the tag line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That which is measured, improves. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if wakatime will improve
your writing, or your coding, or your general state of mind. What I do
know is that manually tracking your time is a pain, and that anything
you can do to manage to keep things running in your time accounting
system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of manual labor is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that you generally don&amp;rsquo;t spend all of your
time inside a text editor. (But maybe you should! Just think how much
more productive you&amp;rsquo;d be.) Wakatime can be set up to also track you
in Chrome and pinpoint just how many hours per day get
absorbed by Twitter or Gmail or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I know myself, this is going to be a temporary enthusiasm. My
experience with the whole &amp;ldquo;quanitifed self&amp;rdquo; world is to know that
some months in the summer, my normal step count is well over 10000,
and that in the winter time it&amp;rsquo;s well under 10000, just because of
Michigan&amp;rsquo;s grey February. Benchmarking time spent sometimes makes you
work more mindfully, and sometimes just recognizes immutable human
issues that no amount of mechanical impetus will change.&lt;/p&gt;
