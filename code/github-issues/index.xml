      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some time now, and since November I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.
Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&amp;rsquo;s usually a lot of duplicates; at less than 100 I&amp;rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&amp;rsquo;s something to be done).</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I started using Github as an issue tracker to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&amp;#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&amp;#39;s some reflection on that use.  I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order.</description>
