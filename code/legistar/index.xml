      <description>A perspective on Ann Arbor area local government, as seen from fall 2015.
The top level view is that local units of government are struggling with their technology investments, having a difficult time keeping them working, and are unwilling or unable to commit to any sort of &amp;ldquo;open data&amp;rdquo; initiatives as a result of their difficulties with basic operations.
Some examples will illustrate.
The City of Ann Arbor keeps track of a wide range of planning and permit documents through a vendor system called eTrakit.</description>
