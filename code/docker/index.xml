      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The task at hand is simple. Whenever a particular airplane is visible overhead,
send out a tweet with that notice. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself with this announcement
more than twice an hour, but try not to have too much lag in reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full stack of hardware and software to do this is not particularly
complicated to use once you get it all running, but there are a series
of issues and observations along the way that add to the complexity. I&amp;rsquo;ll
walk through the whole thing start to finish, and let you know where I
left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plane-spotting:984b95b4570fb7d5b37f67357af2ada0&#34;&gt;Plane spotting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2016/2016-07-02-plane-finding-with-dump1090/&#34;&gt;When last I wrote&lt;/a&gt;,
I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/mutability/dump1090&#34;&gt;dump1090&lt;/a&gt;
running on my MacBook. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the same software and gotten
the latest dev release going on a Raspberry Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to a smaller, simpler antenna, and the result was positive: instead of
having a 40 to 50 nautical mile range, now I&amp;rsquo;m in the 60 to 65 nm range (about 110 km).
It might also help that the Pi 2 is not really doing very much else. That
particular Pi 2 setup is using a slightly back-rev version of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com&#34;&gt;Hypriot&lt;/a&gt; software for the Pi, so it has all
of the modern conveniences plus an instance of Docker on board. The
temptation was to Dockerize everything, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone there yet;
the available Docker prebuilt releases don&amp;rsquo;t have the bleeding edge of
the dump1090-mutability code, and I want to see how the whole thing runs
native for a while before containerizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snag that slowed down this deployment a little was Google&amp;rsquo;s decision
to enforce an API key for personal use of Google Maps. In response, the
very latest dump1090-mutability pulled out its Google Maps support, and
went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://openlayers.org/&#34;&gt;OpenLayers&lt;/a&gt;. This new support gives
access to all kinds of base maps, including some aviation-specific
charts. (&amp;ldquo;Not for use in navigation.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another piece of this was bringing up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lighttpd.net/&#34;&gt;lighttpd&lt;/a&gt;
(&amp;ldquo;lighty&amp;rdquo;), a lightweight HTTP server that replaces the rickety
built-in HTTP server that dump1090 had originally shipped with.
Configuration following the supplied instructions was simple,
and lighttpd looks like a very suitable system to put in place to
serve HTTP on embedded-class system that need flexiblity but not
a big footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other component in the Pi setup is an ADS-B feed to the excellent
&lt;a href=&#34;Planefinder&#34;&gt;http://planefinder.net&lt;/a&gt; site. Planefinder provides a Debian
package for setting up the feed, and it runs neatly with only a minimum
of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pi does not yet have a working OpenVPN configuration, so I can&amp;rsquo;t get
to it over the net directly. For that I plan to revisit the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-07-managing-raspberry-pi-openvpn-with-salt/&#34;&gt;SaltStack for Pi&lt;/a&gt;
configuration I wrote up last September. In the interim, salt has
been upgraded, and perhaps it will be a little more stable over bad
connections; we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-analysis:984b95b4570fb7d5b37f67357af2ada0&#34;&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dump1090 provides a data feed in a convenient JSON format, available
through a URL on a standard configuruation. The ADS-B messages themselves
are binary encoded, but the system brings them into JSON so that all
of the downstream processing is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data handling is so straightforward that you can do it all without
needing any special-purpose processing nodes in IBM&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodered.org&#34;&gt;Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;.
A standard HTTP in node polls the data at the pace that you choose,
and a simple function pulls apart the record of all planes into
individual records for each plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Node-RED running is continuing to get easier over time.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing prototyping work on my Macintosh again, using the
new &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/docker-mac-windows-public-beta/&#34;&gt;Docker for Mac&lt;/a&gt;
setup to pick up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/cpswan/node-red/&#34;&gt;Node-RED container&lt;/a&gt;
to do the work in. &lt;a href=&#34;https://kitematic.com/&#34;&gt;Kitematic&lt;/a&gt; comes with Docker for Mac,
providing a convenient dashboard and interface to Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Do note, however, that if you got Docker for Mac running a few months
ago, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to go through a rebuild process to go to the latest
beta. To &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/troubleshoot/#/recreate-or-update-your-containers-after-beta-18-upgrade&#34;&gt;recreate or update your containers after Beta 18 upgrade&lt;/a&gt;
follow the provided instructions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have both Node-RED and dump1090 running, connecting the
two together is straightforward. I started with this
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/dceejay/3288996fefdc3aef04846496277b6444&#34;&gt;gist from dceejay&lt;/a&gt; which
provides the basic flow and feeds into a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap&#34;&gt;worldmap node&lt;/a&gt; that
is a general programmable interface for putting things on a map. My
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/vielmetti/6329ea5a49dadd2f106980a20727d16e&#34;&gt;updated dump1090 gist for Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;
adapts the data for a slightly different format between dump1090 forks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here in it&amp;rsquo;s relatively clear sailing. Set up a flow downstream
from the plane messages, using a filter node to match the name or
ICAO hex code of the airplane that you want to track. Wire it through
a delay filter to set the frequency of messages you want to
allow through, and a formatting node to pretty up the message in
a form suitable for Twitter output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;incomplete-image-and-next-steps:984b95b4570fb7d5b37f67357af2ada0&#34;&gt;Incomplete image and next steps.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a relatively complex stack, but it all fits neatly on a Raspberry Pi 2,
and with a little bit more elbow grease it should be possible to containerize
everything so that it Just Works and can be made to reliably work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to have OpenVPN running on the Pi 2, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t yet, pending
rework of Salt to get that to a current version and to port all of the
work I did from an earlier version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m picking up planes from 60+ nm away, but I know that with a better
antenna, bandpass filter, and amplifier that I can do better.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://puck.nether.net/~jared/blog/?p=160&#34;&gt;Jared Mauch&amp;rsquo;s parts list&lt;/a&gt;
would be the place to go for starters with a very modest budget of
a couple of hundred bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reception is best i fyou have a clear view of the sky, which suggests
an outdoors installation, powering the Pi with power over ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is running on a Pi 2, but reports from Jared and from Phil Karn KA9Q
suggest that if you do upgrade the reception that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to
saturate the Pi 2. Fortunately a Pi 3 does even better at the intended task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out what the very best way to create a Docker image
that handles Node-RED, especially the installation of additional nodes
and the management of flows. You&amp;rsquo;d like to have the whole thing suitably
tidy that it could be all loaded in from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dump1090-mutability is still mutating! It&amp;rsquo;s under active development,
both at the presentation layer and at the decoder layer. So it would
be appropriate to have the attitude for at least one development machine
to be sure that you were ready to rebuild from source whenever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only have half of this stack running (the Node-RED side) but no access
to radios, you can find an existing dump1090 installation and pull the
JSON from there. This is best done only via prior arrangement and only
for testing purposes or for specific tasks. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to crank up Node-RED
to poll a URL every second; don&amp;rsquo;t do that to a poor little Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planes I want to watch don&amp;rsquo;t take off very often - that&amp;rsquo;s the appeal
of watching for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer
you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/distributed-system.txt&#34;&gt;Leslie Lamport, 1987&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services DynamoDB experienced downtime in the N Virginia
availability zone early Sunday morning, September 20, 2015. As
a result, a number of other AWS services inside N Virginia that
depend on DynamoDB also had downtime. Companies and organizations
that built services on top of those systems who didn&amp;rsquo;t have
geographic load balancing were having problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Amazon&amp;rsquo;s report &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/message/5467D2/&#34;&gt;Summary of the Amazon DynamoDB Service Disruption and Related Impacts in the US-East Region&lt;/a&gt; is available as of September 23, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affected services include at least CloudWatch, SES, SNS, SQS, SWS,
AutoScale, Cloud Formation, Directory Service, Key Mgmt and Lambda,
according to a report on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://status.aws.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;http://status.aws.amazon.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/ylastic&#34;&gt;@ylastic&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter
have been helpful in keeping track of outages. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ylastic.com&#34;&gt;http://www.ylastic.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down Detector has a page of AWS outages trouble reports, and
details pulled from Twitter. &lt;a href=&#34;https://downdetector.com/status/aws-amazon-web-services&#34;&gt;https://downdetector.com/status/aws-amazon-web-services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When core infrastructure goes down, it tends to affect other platforms
that depend on that core infrastructure and that hide it from their
users. This in turn affects applications built on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker: &amp;ldquo;We are currently seeing intermittent errors when pushing
and pulling, related to issues that AWS is having. We are currently
investigating the causes, and doing what we can to mitigate the
problems.&amp;rdquo; @dockerstatus and &lt;a href=&#34;http://status.docker.com/&#34;&gt;http://status.docker.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heroku: &amp;ldquo;Starting new dynos (unidling, one-off, scaling or
restarting crashed apps, new releases) is still unavailable.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Until
this incident is resolved, you might be unable to open new support
tickets with us. If you need to communicate with our support staff
during this time, please email outage-support@heroku.com.&amp;rdquo; @herokustatus
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://status.heroku.com/incidents/811&#34;&gt;https://status.heroku.com/incidents/811&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CircleCI: &amp;ldquo;Experiencing Issues with Heroku and AWS&amp;rdquo;. @circleci
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://status.circleci.com/&#34;&gt;http://status.circleci.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TravisCI: &amp;ldquo;Partial System Outage&amp;rdquo;. @traviscistatus and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.traviscistatus.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.traviscistatus.com/&lt;/a&gt; After incident report
at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.traviscistatus.com/incidents/wzyhx97450f4&#34;&gt;https://www.traviscistatus.com/incidents/wzyhx97450f4&lt;/a&gt; ,
&amp;ldquo;Degradations and outages due to AWS us-east-1 domino effect&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of applications built on AWS and on Heroku,
which are at risk of downtime. A comprehensive list is probably
impossible, but here are some reports, in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airbnb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Instant Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Console. The API is hosted in each region, so the command line worked, but the console is hosted out of us-east-1 and was unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Support Tickets. Use this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/html-forms-controller/support-center-issues-u&#34;&gt;workaround&lt;/a&gt; ???&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Canopy. &amp;ldquo;Our iOS app is down due to the system-wide #AWSoutage. Updates will be provided soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canva&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clickfunnels. &amp;ldquo;Our development team is aware of this, however, at this time, the only thing that we can do is wait until the issues at Amazon AWS are resolved completely.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://status.clickfunnels.com/&#34;&gt;http://status.clickfunnels.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-09-11-bluetooth-bluez-inside-docker/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a Bluetooth device attached to a Linux system, it&amp;rsquo;s
not clear how to attach that device to a Docker container on that
same system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bluez&lt;/code&gt;, the Bluetooth driver for Linux, uses the &lt;code&gt;D-Bus&lt;/code&gt; to communicate.
This is more complex than a FIFO or socket interface, and thus less
easy to obviously say how it should be mapped into the Docker processs
and file system space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The references below show several ways of not doing this task,
and hopefully at some point will get answers on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;References for further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daily coffee and wifi at Argus Farm Stop, outside in the sunshine
under a lovely red umbrella canopy. Espresso over ice and a day-old
olive twist. The view is of a Sky Trak lift at the construction
site across moving materials to the back of The Mark, a building
that&amp;rsquo;s going up where the car wash used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news of the day is a death on State Street. A young man was
climbing over the skylights at the Nickels Arcade and fell to his
death when the skylight glass gave way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 1915, the SS Eastland was packed with employees from
the Western Electric Hawthorne Works when it rolled over in
the Chicago River. 844 passengers and crew lost their lives, making
the Eastland disaster the worst shipwreck on the Great Lakes.
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eastlanddisaster.org/&#34;&gt;Eastland Disaster Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;
for extensive notes on and photos of the scene and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/a2civictech/&#34;&gt;a2civictech&lt;/a&gt;
is coming up on Monday, July 27, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.literatibookstore.com/&#34;&gt;Literati Bookstore&lt;/a&gt; is open
again after a water leak caused them to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I wrote a tiny R script that generates maps. The challenge
today is to find a portable environment so that I can deploy this script
on shared infrastructure. The project took 30 minutes of MacBook Air processor
time running full blast parallel, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t care about wall clock time
to complete the effort I do care about building something that I can hand
off to someone else to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rocker-org/ropensci&#34;&gt;ropensci&lt;/a&gt; Docker
package from the Rocker project is the answer, or most of the answer, for this.
Rocker has built R images where lots of useful packages have been installed,
including systems where the install directions are a little bit complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all complicated software environments the biggest challenge is dealing
with dependencies. If you want to use the latest and greatest fast algorithms,
you have to be prepared to spin up on what the cool kids are doing in the
rest of their environment. If somehow you can jump to the edge of the development
in the algorithm world without being tripped up by the hairy dependency graph
that got you there, it can be a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So; install Docker on the Mac with &amp;lsquo;boot2docker&amp;rsquo;; then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;docker pull rocker/ropensci
docker run -it rocker/ropensci R
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and poof, you have an environment current to this month&amp;rsquo;s desktop of leading
R developers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker Detroit, Wednesday July 22, 2015, 6:00 pm, Troy, Michigan</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-22-docker-detroit/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2015 10:50:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-22-docker-detroit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you at Docker Detroit&amp;rsquo;s kickoff meeting, to be held
at RIIS, 1250 Stephenson Highway, Suite 200 in Troy, MI starting
at 6:00 p.m. tonight July 22 2015.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be coming in from Ann
Arbor. The venue is between 14 Mile and Maple behind Beaumont Hospital.
Google Maps suggests that because of construction on I-75 in that
area you might want to head north on Campbell instead of taking
the I-75 / I-696 interchange north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading the meeting tonight is Pepijn Bruienne from the University
of Michigan. He will be speaking about &amp;ldquo;Docker in production&amp;rdquo;
and organizing a group discussion with Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Detroit/events/223111645/&#34;&gt;meetup announcement&lt;/a&gt;
for more details, refreshments will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetup is hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.riis.com&#34;&gt;RIIS&lt;/a&gt; a boutique web
and mobile development house. Hope to see you there!  I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking
notes and plan to do a writeup of the event, as well as sharing my
own experiences running Docker for ARM on a Raspberry PI 2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>bocker is a subset of Docker in 100 lines of shell script</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/p8952/bocker&#34;&gt;bocker&lt;/a&gt; is Docker (or at least
a good sized subset of it) in 100 lines of shell script.
I suppose the point is that even though there&amp;rsquo;s a huge
world of hype surrounding containerization as a next step
of systems management, when you get down to it, it&amp;rsquo;s just not
that complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bringing up Node-RED and mosquitto under &#34;docker compose&#34; on a Raspberry Pi</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-13-bringing-up-node-red-and-mosquitto-under-docker-compose-on-a-raspberry-pi/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2015 02:18:01 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-13-bringing-up-node-red-and-mosquitto-under-docker-compose-on-a-raspberry-pi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Progress, actually quite a lot of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, neatly stated. Docker is good for bringing up single services (&#34;microservices&#34;), but sometimes your application needs more than one thing running for the whole thing to work. Enter &#34;docker compose&#34;, formerly &#34;fig&#34;, which automates the process of running various Docker commands in the right order with the right arguments all driven from a configuration file. As described by their documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particular task I have in front of me is launching Node-RED and mosquitto (an MQTT broker) together on a Raspberry Pi 2 which is running Hypriot and Docker. Most of the background for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; that&#39;s a relevant task is at this post on Hypriot, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-compose-nodejs-haproxy/&#34;&gt;How to use Docker Compose to run complex multi container apps on your Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;, which I dutifully and successfully managed to run all of the examples from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by this I tried to get Wordpress running with MySQL but got stuck because of a variety of things (not the least of which was some over-enthusiastic documentation that downplayed the complexity of that task, and the lack of a Pi-specific Wordpress Docker images). But having had the taste of what might be I carried on until I managed to get something to work for what I really wanted: Node-RED running alongside mosquitto so that I could have a local MQTT broker to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
nodered:
  image: nieleyde/rpi2-nodered
  command: flows.json
  volumes:
    - /home/pi/node-red:/root/.node-red
  ports: 
    - &#34;1880:1880&#34;
  links:
    - mosquitto

mosquitto:
  image: nieleyde/rpi-mosquitto
  ports:
    - &#34;1883:1883&#34;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some subtleties to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nieleyde/rpi2-nodered runs on the Pi 2; there&#39;s a corresponding nieleyde/rpi-nodered for the Pi. Both are ARM images. I haven&#39;t yet tweaked this to run on x86, but if you do, you&#39;ll need to update the &#34;image&#34; stanzas everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &#34;command&#34; and &#34;volumes&#34; stanzas in the nodered configuration serve to make Docker mount a subdirectory on the host machine where the flows.json file is stored; this makes changes to the configuration persistent. If you want a read-only configuration, you&#39;ll need to change this; I haven&#39;t gotten that far yet. It might also make sense to have a data volume container, but again I&#39;m not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &#34;mosquitto&#34; configuration is extremely bare bones and runs the default config, which is wide open. I haven&#39;t gotten far enough to replace the config file with something better, but that&#39;s an obvious next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From within Node-RED you refer to this internal MQTT server at hostname &#34;mosquitto&#34;, port &#34;1883&#34;. If the links stanza was changed to &#34;mqtt&#34; and the mosquitto section was changed to &#34;mqtt&#34; you&#39;d then refer to the MQTT server at hostname &#34;mqtt&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue open on Niel Eyde&#39;s rpi-nodered Github, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/issues/5&#34;&gt;documentation for how to extend this image with your own nodes and flows&lt;/a&gt;, where I&#39;m working some of this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Node-RED Github, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/node-red/node-red/issues/603&#34;&gt;Support for Docker install for Node-RED&lt;/a&gt;, which is epic and helpful in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/&#34;&gt;Hypriot weblog&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the aforementioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-compose-nodejs-haproxy/&#34;&gt;Docker Compose examples&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/compose&#34;&gt;Hypriot Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker 1.7.0 issues: problems with Mac and boot2docker, ARM, Ubuntu, and disk size of images</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-26-docker-170-issues-problems-with-mac-and-boot2docker-arm-and-disk-size-of-images/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 19:50:46 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-26-docker-170-issues-problems-with-mac-and-boot2docker-arm-and-disk-size-of-images/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker 1.7.0 has been released into the wild. Every .0 release of software should be expected to have some issues, no matter how good the QA and automated test process. Here&#39;s what to expect if you&#39;re getting Docker 1.7.0 up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;boot2docker on Mac&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mac, with boot2docker: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/938&#34;&gt;Docker certs not valid with 1.7 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; is issue 938 on boot2docker. The symptom is a message like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An error occurred trying to connect: Get https://192.168.59.103:2376/v1.19/containers/json: x509: certificate is valid for 127.0.0.1, 10.0.2.15, not 192.168.59.103&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and restarting docker on the VM with &lt;code&gt;boot2docker ssh sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart&lt;/code&gt; fixes it, at least temporarily. Read through the issue on github to see the full diagnosis - as best I understand it, eth1 is not up when certificates are generated, hence the cert not valid error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Raspberry Pi or any other ARM system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Raspberry Pi: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14184&#34;&gt;Docker 1.7 on RaspberryPI : &#34;socket operation on non-socket&#34;&lt;/a&gt; is issue 14184 on docker. The symptom is a message like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[tki@anzu ~]$ docker start redis
  Error response from daemon: Cannot start container redis: socket operation on non-socket
  Error: failed to start containers: [redis]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error flushed out a whole set of people running Docker on ARM on a variety of platforms, all having similar issues. If you&#39;re running a Scaleway C1, ODROID C1, ODROID XU3-Lite, Utilite Pro, Cubox 4x4, and all flavors of Raspberry Pi or Pi 2 you&#39;ll see this. &#34;When using --net host the container starts&#34; is the report, but port forwarding fails to work in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ubuntu: problems with statically compiled Docker binaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14035&#34;&gt;Ubuntu 15.04 vivid can not start docker 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt;, docker issue 14035. The relevant bits of the error message are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ERRO[0000] Udev sync is not supported. This will lead to unexpected behavior, data loss and errors. For more information, see https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#daemon-storage-driver-option &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;ERRO[0000] [graphdriver] prior storage driver &#34;devicemapper&#34; failed: driver not supported &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;FATA[0000] Error starting daemon: error initializing graphdriver: driver not supported &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a long discussion, culminating in &lt;code&gt;In the end, removing /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/ will fix the issue&lt;/code&gt;, but people are also rolling back to 1.6.2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ubuntu on x86: large file sizes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report that &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-1-7-0-is-using-huge-amount-of-disk-space/2046&#34;&gt;Docker 1.7.0 is using huge amounts of disk space&lt;/a&gt; appears on the Docker forum, item 2046. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14204&#34;&gt;Pulling image fills disk/image size is huge, version 1.7.0&lt;/a&gt; is issue 14204 on Docker. Not much insight into this one yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The annual conference for Docker, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dockercon.com/&#34;&gt;Dockercon&lt;/a&gt;, has been going on. A few highlights from the event as seen through Twitter - I was not there to attend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker is real on the Raspberry Pi through support for the ARM processor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Awesome live demo of Docker on a Raspberry Pi by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Quintus23M&#34;&gt;@Quintus23M&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dockercon?src=hash&#34;&gt;#dockercon&lt;/a&gt; closing keynote. &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/DJfBtpcYws&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DJfBtpcYws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bridget Kromhout (@bridgetkromhout) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout/status/613495958089785344&#34;&gt;June 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker&#39;s plumbing is being spun out as &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/&#34;&gt;runC&lt;/a&gt;. The new infrastructure supports migration of containers from one server to another, illustrated through a Quake III demo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker&#39;s new RunC doesn&#39;t (yet?) work on Mac OS X</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-22-dockers-new-runc-doesnt-yet-work-on-mac-os-x-/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2015 16:53:10 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-22-dockers-new-runc-doesnt-yet-work-on-mac-os-x-/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker has a new runtime environment that they are releasing called &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/&#34;&gt;runC&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a &#34;lightweight universal plumbing&#34; that tries to encapsulate all of the Docker dependencies and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To build Docker we have re-used large quantities of plumbing: Linux, Go, lxc, aufs, lvm, iptables, virtualbox, vxlan, mesos, etcd, consul, systemd… the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of Docker&#39;s start on Linux systems, it&#39;s been tricky to get it running under Mac OS X. Some tries to make it work depend on setting up virtual machines (with the likes of boot2docker) which makes it work at the cost of performance and flexibility. Docker on OS X has not been exceptionally easy though it does work once you commit to doing all of your Docker server work inside a VM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;runC would be an answer to the problem of native Docker on OSX X, one might hope, but as of its first release it doesn&#39;t work. The first of what is probably many hurdles is the extensive use of the clone(2) system call instead of fork(2). This &lt;a href=&#34;http://files.meetup.com/10602292/See%20Docker%20from%20the%20Perspective%20of%20Linux%20Process.pdf&#34;&gt;presentation from Allen Sun at DaoCloud&lt;/a&gt; goes into the details of Docker&#39;s use of clone(2) from the perspective of Linux processes. It is notable that the OS X &#34;Darwin&#34; kernel doesn&#39;t have clone(2), and it&#39;s as far as I can tell not readily possible to mimic all of clone&#39;s semantics strictly by using fork in clever ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open issue on Github is tracking &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/9&#34;&gt;Build fails on Mac OS X 10.9&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t see an easy fix without work by Apple on their kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running Node-RED on a Raspberry Pi with Docker and Hypriot</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-23-running-node-red-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-docker-and-hypriot/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2015 02:06:33 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-23-running-node-red-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-docker-and-hypriot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My goal for the week was to empty out my inbox sufficiently that I would be able to make progress on some programming tasks that are hard to do when there&#39;s distractions. The inbox got all the way down to zero, and that meant that there was a chunk of evening time suitable for hacking. Happy to report that the result of this is Node-RED running on a Raspberry Pi under Docker on top of Hypriot. A word of explanation of how this all works in detail is too much, but here&#39;s where I got the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/getting-started-with-docker-on-your-arm-device/&#34;&gt;Hypriot&#39;s gettting started guide&lt;/a&gt; brings you up to speed on getting Docker running on your ARM device (e.g. your Raspberry Pi). They have bootable images that you can download and burn to SD card, and from there you load up applications from Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypriot has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk&#34;&gt;chat window&lt;/a&gt; on Gitter, so you can pop in and there will be occasionally people to assist. Best to do things European time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/&#34;&gt;DockerHub&lt;/a&gt; is a one stop shop for packaged applications. When you&#39;re running on the Pi, you&#39;ll want to seek out versions with &#39;rpi&#39; or &#39;arm&#39; in their names as they have likely been adapted for that system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up pulling Niel Eyde&#39;s Raspberry Pi versions of Node-RED from DockerHub as &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nieleyde/rpi-nodered/&#34;&gt;nieleyde/rpi-nodered&lt;/a&gt;. It has all sorts of interesting modules that I had not previously built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node-RED is at 0.10.6 at this writing. Its &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi.html&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi support&lt;/a&gt; includes hardware support using &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiringpi.com/&#34;&gt;WiringPi&lt;/a&gt; to access the GPIO pins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node-RED currently supports Node.JS 0.10. Node.JS and IO.JS have &lt;a href=&#34;http://sdtimes.com/node-js-and-io-js-to-merge-under-node-js-foundation/&#34;&gt;merged forces&lt;/a&gt; after a fork, which means hopefully development will start to be sane again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all said I am not sure I have everything I need yet but as a leap forward it&#39;s pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
