      <description>The a2b3 lunch this week was at Mi Compadre, a Mexican place on Packard. We had a good turnout. I recommend the lengua tacos.
I was inspired this week for the lunch question by going to the Workantile lunch on Wednesday, which followed the same general pattern - sit down, introduce yourself around the table, and answer some simple question. At Workantile the prompt was simply &amp;ldquo;share something nice that happened to you this week&amp;rdquo;, and that was enough of a prompt for everyone to be brief and cheery.</description>
