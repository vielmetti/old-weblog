      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Github issues to track my personal todo list for quite some time now, and since November I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Waffle.io to help that process.
Waffle in this use is a view of a series of queues in my todo list. Most everything that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing now lives in the &amp;ldquo;backlog&amp;rdquo; queue, which I try to keep to less than 100 just to keep myself sane. (At more than 100 there&amp;rsquo;s usually a lot of duplicates; at less than 100 I&amp;rsquo;m probably not acknowledging that there&amp;rsquo;s something to be done).</description>

      <description>A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues. By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status. This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.
I&#39;ve been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while, using its milestones feature to track categories.</description>
