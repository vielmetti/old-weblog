      <description>&lt;p&gt;A kanban board is simply a two-dimensional view of a series of work queues.
By moving a piece of work from one column to another, you update its status.
This gives you a quick way to visualize your current priorities, as well
as making it very clear when one or more of your queues are too full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using Github issues as a personal issue tracker for a while,
using its milestones feature to track categories. This has been mostly
a one-dimensional exercise of managing very long lists, or shorter lists.
It&#39;s been cumbersome to use either labels or milestones to handle the quick
need to say to yourself &#34;I&#39;m going to focus on this now&#34; without the issue
sinking back quickly into a mile-long undifferentiated list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter a whole series of Github add-ons that all add a similar feature, the kanban-style
column view. I&#39;ll list them here with any experience I currently have using
them. My best bet is that at some point Github absorbs one of these and makes 
it its own, but that is tempered by the realization that Github issues really
isn&#39;t changing much as a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zenhub, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zenhub.io/&#34;&gt;zenhub.io&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Google Chrome plugin, which gives you a kanban-style view of your issues. It only works in Chrome. I tried it, but didn&#39;t see an easy way to configure which columns referred to which labels, and after a few tries gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waffle, &lt;a href=&#34;https://waffle.io/&#34;&gt;waffle.io&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment this is what I&#39;m using. You authenticate to it with Github, and then it displays your issues. Free (for now), they are advertising that it will be $7/mo for private repos, which is what I currently pay for all of the rest of Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huboard, &lt;a href=&#34;https://huboard.com&#34;&gt;huboard.com&lt;/a&gt;. Free for open source repos or $7/mo/user for private repos. 14 day free trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blossom, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blossom.io&#34;&gt;blossom.io&lt;/a&gt;. No free plan, 14 day trial, minimum is a 5 user plan at $22/mo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task Tub, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tasktub.com/&#34;&gt;tasktub.com&lt;/a&gt;. Company page does not load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SweepBoard, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sweepboard.com/&#34;&gt;sweepboard.com&lt;/a&gt;. Free for open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started finding these sorts of things, I didn&#39;t really realize that it was a whole category of products. Most of them have some other features beyond the kanban to add to Github as a project management tool. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a category winner, but if you are interested in visualizing your work and taking your todo list beyond the simple long list this is a useful set of tools to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
