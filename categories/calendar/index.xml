      <description>from a Perry Marshall recorded call (very long, interesting, but very long)
 January - keep your new years resolution; how to drive in ice and snow February - heart month; seasonal affective disorder, effect on appetite March - March Madness basketball; cosmetic surgery for bikini season April - spring cleaning, income taxes May - summer vacations, Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, the problem that Mom faces June - Christmas pitches, stay safe on vacation July - Independence (the word), travel safely with kids August - hot summer weather impact on business, back to school September - Labor Day, weddings, census October - lawn and garden cleanup, consumer information month November - winterize car and home, heating costs December - unusual gifts, gift certificates, save money on taxes  The instructive effort would be to use Google Trends to quantify the peakiness of each of these in time and space, and synchronize your annual seasonal efforts early enough to capture interest and to be properly indexed when time comes for people to search.</description>
