      <description>So you&#39;re writing a resume or a CV or a biographical sketch. What do you need to say to make you into a superhero with a fantastic back story that hints at your future greatness?
Retcon comes from &#34;retroactive continuity&#34;, a plot device first used in comic books. See Urban Dictionary for a fun definition.
I have a sneaking suspicion that once I go back far enough and create some retroactive continuity that I&#39;ll be able to describe my life as a set of 30-year projects, many of which are already in progress and that run in parallel and not just one after the other.</description>

      <description>As part of my search for work in Ann Arbor, I&amp;#39;ve been compiling a list of employers who maintain lists of open opportunities on their web sites. You can see the list here
http://arborwiki.org/city/Jobs
As of this writing there are about 60 employers listed, though not all of them have open positions at this time.
There&amp;#39;s a wide variety of online job postings systems being used by employers, ranging from the simple web page listing one or two positions to the unimaginably complex setup when an HR organization has hundreds of positions to fill worldwide.</description>
