      <description>This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens, and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.
Coconut-potato curry.
 2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved 1 onion, chopped Oil for frying curry powder, to taste 1 can coconut milk 2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed  Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done.</description>
