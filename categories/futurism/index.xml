      <description>Imagine that it&amp;#39;s the year 2020; it&amp;#39;s easy if you try. Facebook has been a public company for eight years. Its market dominance is being challenged by something. What is that something?
Something new
One possibility is that people&amp;#39;s tastes are fickle, and that just like when something better came along to AOL users, they switched. It hardly matters what the new system is - just that it&amp;#39;s new, and that it provides a green field to play on to make new friends and express a new part of your personality, and that it doesn&amp;#39;t burden you with everything that you had ever done before that.</description>
