      <description>&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is from Martha Rose &amp;quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&amp;quot; 1986, p. 103.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s very simple, as befits her normal cooking.&amp;#0160; Cut the tops from peppers, clean them out, fill with a mix of leftover rice and beans and top with cheese.&amp;#0160; Bake 30 to 40 minutes, as long as it takes for things to get as soft as you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing I&amp;#39;ll end up using black beans; there&amp;#39;s rice from yesterday.&amp;#0160; We have an abundance of tomatoes from market, since it&amp;#39;s the season when you order a half a peck they are SO HAPPY that someone wants their roma tomatoes in quantity that you end up with an extra pint of cherry tomatoes just to taste.&amp;#0160; The 4 y/o will want the beans plain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook all the peppers in the fridge, there will be more on Saturday. The freeze watch line is as far south as Gaylord, so we should be good for a few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;asset asset-image&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;display: inline;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Frz_plt-Sep-28&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b image-full &#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef0120a5a6dc58970b-800wi&#34; title=&#34;Frz_plt-Sep-28&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
