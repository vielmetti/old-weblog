        <p>In his An internet x-ray machine for the masses, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to mitmproxy, a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to get between your browser and the Internet and poke at (and change) the traffic going between the two. http://mitmproxy.org is the home of mitmproxy.

        <p>A productive afternoon with Mohan Kartha in which I opened a great many tabs in Chrome. This bit of writing to close those out. Elixir Vitae is a great spot for writing - lots of quiet noise from the coolers to keep a background hum, and close to the bus station. I&rsquo;m sorting out the simplest task that I&rsquo;d like to do with Node-RED, now that I have a Raspberry Pi 2 running it under Docker in a configuration that&rsquo;s reliable enough that it seems like it&rsquo;s stable. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-21-coworking-notes/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Espresso over ice at ERC South Main. This is now my favorite summer drink. Served in a cup with enough ice and you get the makings of a very strong iced latte, just add a little half and half. The work of the morning is finishing up yesterday&rsquo;s work on sending postcards with Lob.com. Key to this effort is resizing your favorite images so that they meet the template. Fortunately I had the presence of mind seven years ago to write up my notes on using sips and Imagemagick for image manipulation and that helped. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-21-daily-coffee-wifi-erc-south-main/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s a warm but pleasant mid-summer late Monday morning, and I&rsquo;m visiting the first cafe inbound on a walk to town. Biggby Packard is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so. Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&rsquo;s not really enough here to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus. I&rsquo;ve been in here before when I was the only patron for more than an hour but this morning there&rsquo;s a few more people sitting typing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-20-daily-coffee-wifi-packard-biggby/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>squid is a web caching system. Instead of browsing directly to a site, you point your browser at a squid cache, and the cache serves up cached copies of the data you are asking for. If squid has an out of date copy of the data it fetches a new one for you. The goal is to be a transparent cache, and to be nearly as fast as direct access when you don't have the data, and way faster when you do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-28-using-a-squid-cache-to-make-automated-data-collection-a-bit-less-rude/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough. Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Setting up Octopress has given me a chance to look through some of my old Github repositories and re-assess what's there and how to improve on them. This is more like a wish list than an actual set of directions, and it reflects how much the world has moved since I first signed up for a github account. aadl-amazon-linky and superpatron.

        <p>I am using Octopress to build a new web site at http://vielmetti.github.io. This looks like it will be a good place as any to write about code and any github projects I am working on. I will keep writing about everything else here. To write in Octopress you put files in a directory written in Markdown.

        <p>Welcome to the Wednesday version of a daily Hacker News summary. In the news today: a new Gmail interface, a Drupal security breach, how to negotiate a job offer, Bill Gates goes to India, and Mary Meeker's Internet Trends. I'm going to diverge a little from past practice and pick and choose a little more carefully than normally, going a little beyond the top 8 to find the stories that actually interest me. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-29-hacker-news-summary-wednesday-29-may-2013-500-pm-est-edition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A summary of Hacker News from 3:00 p.m. on Memorial Day. It&#39;s getting faster to produce these, but it still takes at least a minute or two per each. I wonder about the churn rate of the Hacker News front page. How long do you have to wait to ensure that the top 10 posts have all cycled out? Every day is clearly enough, but I&#39;m suspecting that it might take as little as 12 hours to cycle through what passes for news. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-hacker-news-summary-monday-27-may-2013-300-pm-edition/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The video, entitled "It is pitch dark", from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot. The lyrics, in part: You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue? The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-21-you-are-likely-to-be-eaten-by-a-grue/">&raquo;</a></p>
