      <description>Serious Eats has a blog, A Sandwich A Day, with a nicely illustrated and well researched sandwich every single day.
 In this great country of ours, one could eat a different sandwich every day of the yearâ€”so that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. Here&#39;s A Sandwich a Day, our daily look at sandwiches around the country. Got a sandwich we should check out?
 As a a part of this they note the Grandwich competition in Grand Rapids, where 10 sandwich vendors competed for the best sandwich in town prize.</description>
