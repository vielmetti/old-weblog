      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tilde.club&#34;&gt;tilde.club&lt;/a&gt; now has Usenet news, of the very old fashioned sort where there is only a small handful of newsgroups and where people are still figuring out their newsreaders and news hosting systems and where there&#39;s no spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions are at &lt;a href=&#34;http://tilde.club/~emv/usenet&#34;&gt;~emv/usenet&lt;/a&gt;, such as they are; looking to get enough people on board so that there&#39;s a reasonable next step of setting up a feed infrastructure of some kind eventually. The current set of directions are rather plain, but it will get more fancy, just fancy enough to bootstrap but not much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss Usenet terribly much, since it&#39;s a place where I spent a lot of time and made a lot of friends. It was horrible when it was deluged in the Eternal September, and it never really recovered. It&#39;s entirely possible that the network can be reconstructed in bits, one little system at a time very selectively feeding groups to other little systems, but it&#39;s going to take some work.&lt;/p&gt;
