      <description>tilde.club now has Usenet news, of the very old fashioned sort where there is only a small handful of newsgroups and where people are still figuring out their newsreaders and news hosting systems and where there&#39;s no spam.
Instructions are at ~emv/usenet, such as they are; looking to get enough people on board so that there&#39;s a reasonable next step of setting up a feed infrastructure of some kind eventually. The current set of directions are rather plain, but it will get more fancy, just fancy enough to bootstrap but not much more.</description>
