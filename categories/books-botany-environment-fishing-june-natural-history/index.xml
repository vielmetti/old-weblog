      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We found the main stream to law that the teeter-snipe pattered about in what last year were trout riffles, and so warm that we could duck in its deepest pool without a shout. Even after our cooling swim, waders felt like hot tar paper in the sun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac. This 1989 Oxford Paperbacks edition, ISBN 0-19-505928-X, as an introductory essay from Robert Finch commemorating the 100th anniversary of Leopold&#39;s birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We see Leopold, the rural sage, tracking a sunk in January, cutting a venerable dead oak, stalking a legendary fish on Alder Fork or an elusive grouse on an abandoned farm, surveying his private unofficial domain before dawn, wrestling with god-like decisions about tree-thinning, or experiencing a &#34;curious transfusion of courage&#34; from his pines in deep winter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand County Almanac is a good book to come back to every month year round.&lt;/p&gt;
