      <description>In 1939, the American Institute of Steel Construction awarded its First Prize for Movable Bridges to the Second Ave. Bridge in Alpena, MI. Clifford E. Paine was the engineer, and the work was done by the R.C. Mahon Co. for the City of Alpena, MI.

      <description>This is breaking news, and this blog post will be out of date.
The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River has collapsed near Mount Vernon, Washington. A map shows where the incident happened, about half way between Seattle and the Canadian border.
 
As of this writing there are no confirmed details about the cause of the bridge collapse. The Seattle Times says it may have been because an oversized truck hit the bridge with its load.</description>

      <description>Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Stadium Bridges are reopening on Wednesday, November 14, 2012 after about a year of being closed for reconstruction, according to messages from the city. The latest information that I have is that the bridge will open at 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but that there will be intermittent lane closures for the rest of the week to finish up the job. City engineer Mike Nearing emailed me to say that &amp;quot;at least one sidewalk will be open while our contractor works to clean and finish the work on the roadway and bridges.</description>
