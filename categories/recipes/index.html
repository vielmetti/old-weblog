        <p>A simple recipe that you can order from your favorite barista: an espresso shot over ice. Leave enough room to add a spot of half and half. Cold, refreshing, and very strong. To try: a shot of espresso over shaved ice. I think this is doable at Ann Arbor Farmers Market where you&rsquo;d go to the stall where a granny is selling shaved ice, and then walk a plain snow cone over to the Roos Roast stand for your espresso shot. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-espresso-over-ice-with-a-little-half-and-half/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception. I&rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; category, and also created a &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&rsquo;s sort of like a subcategory but not really&hellip;well it is as long as I am careful about it. Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use of Gopher as a cookbook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-14-the-hugo-cookbook/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mac and Goat calls for goat cheese; we generally use a goat gouda or a goat cheddar, both of which are usually available at the local Trader Joe&rsquo;s. Feel free to substitute any hard cheese that melts well in your recipe. The dish also calls for rice pasta, but again feel free to substitute; you&rsquo;re aiming for something like a rotini which handles the sauce well.

Sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, and a cinnamon+coriander+cumin spice. The Picky Eater: Indian Chickpea and Potato Stew.

        <p>Writing this down so I remember this one detail: to get fries the right size, cut a medium potato into 16 pieces. (Cut in 4 equal width slices, then cut each slice into 4 parts). It works pretty quickly once you get going, and the resulting fries get crispy much more so than potatoes cut into quarters. A sweet potato yields 32 fries, cut in half and then in fours and then in fours). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-oven-fried-potato-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The key here is "season to taste". We had more than 2 tsp of freshly made chipotle powder and I used it all, and it ended up being a bit more spicy than the normal food around our house (but still delicious). The recipe also calls for roasted pasilla peppers, which we didn't have so we didn't use them. I'm sure that any other roasted pepper would add to the flavor. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-spicy-sweet-potato-and-black-bean-salad/">&raquo;</a></p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This recipe is assembled from a variety of sources; I'll update when I've actually made it myself to report back. The basic idea is that you make a dressing of mayo thinned with a little vinegar, and you use equal part shredded kohlrabi and shredded apple in the salad. Mustard is a common seasoning. Some variations on the theme, with links to recipes: AllRecipes adds prepared mustard, lemon juice, and sugar to the dressing Epicurious replaces the mayo with heavy cream and adds some chopped parsley and mustard Boston Organics follows Epicurious but replaces parsley with mint The Floating Kitchen adds carrots, and replaces the mayo with Greek yogurt Martha Stewart dresses the slaw with olive oil and lemon juice and skips the mayo Edible Twin Cities adds some fennel to the salad I could continue but this is enough meta-information to head to the kitchen. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-21-kohlrabi-and-apple-slaw-a-study-in-comparative-literature/">&raquo;</a></p>

I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-13-from-chekovs-gooseberries/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This simple asparagus with mushrooms dish is served with pasta. J doesn&#39;t like linguini, so we made it with rotini.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This recipe for kale with corn and green onions works well enough with frozen corn, but I&#39;m sure it would be better with fresh. You cook with the ingredients you have, not the ingredients you want to have. We&#39;re lucky to have fresh kale at the farmers market! Ingredients: oil for frying garlic 1 bag kale corn - frozen, if you must, but fresh would be better green onions - chopped soy sauce Method: Wash and spin-dry the kale, being careful to get dirt out of the center rib. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-28-kale-with-corn-and-green-onions/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>That&#39;s the word from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt: Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&#0160; That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after the peonies start but before the u-pick strawberries are ready.
