        <p>The recipe for cooking the trout was simple: foil, lemon, and basil. It would have done well with a bit of olive oil or butter in the foil to bring out the flavor; it probably could have used some salt, in retrospect. The fish had been cleaned but not filleted. I don&#39;t have the tools or the knowledge to fillet a trout, but some people have it down pat; this video from &quot;battlebauble&quot; on YouTube looks convincing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-08-23-when-the-boys-bring-home-trout-from-the-trout-farm-theres-no-question-that-its-trout-for-dinner/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I cooked this recipe - inspired by the recipes I found for Kedgeree - last night. I don&#39;t know what all of the boundaries are for an authentic recipe for this dish, which appears to have enough variety in the various descriptions of it that nearly anything with fish flaked into rice and spiced with Indian spices could be close. 2 cups rice cooked in 4 cups water safflower oil; some recipes call for ghee 1 onion, chopped small; garlic if you like it spices: curry powder, mustard seed, and similar vegetables: chopped tomatoes, peas, etc 2 tablespoons lemon juice salt, pepper fish: cooked or canned fish, fresh or smoked; we used canned boneless salmon greens: minced parsley or cilantro; dried OK in a pinch hard boiled eggs for garnish The method runs roughly as follows. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-20-kedgeree-or-something-quite-similar-to-it/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The github style of software development has, unusually, embraced the &quot;fork&quot; as a way of encouraging software use and reuse. Rather than being tied to a single repository owned by a single maintainer who accepts or rejects patches at their whims, you can easily fork an entire project in github and then work on it on your own. Notably this is not seen as treasonous even if it means that plans diverge. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-29-forking-the-cookbook/">&raquo;</a></p>

Quince caramel from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels.

        <p>Working my way through the rhubarb recipe set, I find variations on what I made tonight, which was stewed rhubarb. If you were to separate the juice from the fruit, you&#39;d get Rhubarb Syrup, as seen in the New York Times&#0160;(water, vanilla pod, no sugar), The Kitchn&#0160;(4c rhubarb, 1c sugar, 1c water, ginger root), Food in Jars&#0160;(more sugar). Use as a flavoring in fizzy water, or in a fizzy drink. Rhubarb Daisy, a drink made with this syrup (gin, lemon juice, soda, syrup) is seen in The Paupered Chef.&#0160; You can use both parts of the straining operation when you&#39;re done with stewed rhubarb. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-rhubarb/">&raquo;</a></p>

The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere. The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-17-delicious-ketchup/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The basic idea is from Martha Rose &quot;Fast Vegetarian Feasts&quot; 1986, p. 103.&#0160; It&#39;s very simple, as befits her normal cooking.&#0160; Cut the tops from peppers, clean them out, fill with a mix of leftover rice and beans and top with cheese.&#0160; Bake 30 to 40 minutes, as long as it takes for things to get as soft as you want. I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll end up using black beans; there&#39;s rice from yesterday.&#0160; We have an abundance of tomatoes from market, since it&#39;s the season when you order a half a peck they are SO HAPPY that someone wants their roma tomatoes in quantity that you end up with an extra pint of cherry tomatoes just to taste.&#0160; The 4 y/o will want the beans plain. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-09-28-stuffed-peppers-with-leftover-grains-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>We had purple beans for dinner, from farmer&#39;s market.&#0160; I heated some olive oil in a pan and cooked them through until they had turned all green, and then salted them a little at the end. The recipe called for adding chopped almonds but it didn&#39;t happen; instead I served the boys tofu that I had cut into cubes and boiled (boiling it improves the texture quite a bit, firming it up more to my liking). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-08-04-purple-beans-for-dinner-or-anthocyanin-pigmentation-in-phaseolus-vulgaris/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the delicious tag polenta, from the blog Hungry Cravings - the so called Cheater Method Polenta. The critics were skeptical: Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck! but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-01-baked-polenta-no-stir-polenta-sounds-like-no-water-soup---possible-but-unlikely/">&raquo;</a></p>

Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-14-scrambled-eggs/">&raquo;</a></p>
