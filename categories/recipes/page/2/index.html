        <p>I promised myself in October 2010 that I&#39;d write about things just enough in advance to make them work so that I could have some things to make close at hand from fresh produce at Farmer&#39;s Market, and regretted that I didn&#39;t have quince recipes ready.&#0160; &#0160;To remedy that, here&#39;s a few. Quince caramel from Chez Pim. Poach quinces in syrup, use the quince syrup to make caramels.

        <p>Working my way through the rhubarb recipe set, I find variations on what I made tonight, which was stewed rhubarb. If you were to separate the juice from the fruit, you&#39;d get Rhubarb Syrup, as seen in the New York Times&#0160;(water, vanilla pod, no sugar), The Kitchn&#0160;(4c rhubarb, 1c sugar, 1c water, ginger root), Food in Jars&#0160;(more sugar). Use as a flavoring in fizzy water, or in a fizzy drink. Rhubarb Daisy, a drink made with this syrup (gin, lemon juice, soda, syrup) is seen in The Paupered Chef.&#0160; You can use both parts of the straining operation when you&#39;re done with stewed rhubarb. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-rhubarb/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As an exercise for wanting to keep enough bookmarks in delicious, or more likely its crowd of descendants, I provide to you some delicious ketchup. The problem with a general Google search for ketchup is that there is so much ketchup out there - so many recipes, so many products, so much Heinz everywhere. The delicious search for ketchup for me was a directed search; I knew that one of those interesting magazines that comes from New York City had a story about ketchup once, and how it was the perfect food. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-17-delicious-ketchup/">&raquo;</a></p>

I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll end up using black beans; there&#39;s rice from yesterday.&#0160; We have an abundance of tomatoes from market, since it&#39;s the season when you order a half a peck they are SO HAPPY that someone wants their roma tomatoes in quantity that you end up with an extra pint of cherry tomatoes just to taste.&#0160; The 4 y/o will want the beans plain. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-09-28-stuffed-peppers-with-leftover-grains-recipe/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some notes, more for myself than for you. Horseradish is now available at market; $4 for a jar from Grandma&#39;s Kitchen.&#0160; Grandma says hers is pure, not mixed with turnip as some would do.&#0160; Farmers Market had a lot of produce - field greens and flowers were the big new crops.&#0160; We had some tat soi from Shannon Brines that was very good in a stir fry. The phone on the farm in Homer, MI is answered only at 8am, if I read the handout right. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-04-06-menu-plan-monday-first-week-of-april/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m just going to keep posting about blueberries until I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be summer again; I think we have a few tubs still in the freezer. The search is for a blueberry muffin recipe with cardamom, and here&#39;s some sample of same, to see what the variety is in the recipes so that perhaps some meta-recipe will emerge.&#0160; Do be sure to read the first one through; it&#39;s a moving memorial and a story of how we celebrate the end of someone&#39;s life. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-20-blueberry-muffins-with-cardamom-some-recipes-in-the-hopes-that-summer-will-arrive/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A second try at menu plan Monday, written Sunday night. Farmer&#39;s market on Saturday was eggs, apples, some good conversation and not much more food.&#0160; We didn&#39;t get there early enough for fresh greens from Brines Farm, and by the time we were there Wasem&#39;s was out of donuts.&#0160; Still a lot of fun. Food coop was pleasant, but I didn&#39;t do most of my shopping there.&#0160; Next week I&#39;ll do shopping for spices there, since their selection is best and they are never out of stock of anything. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-01-12-menu-plan-monday-second-week-of-january/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Joy of Cooking, my go-to cookbook for some basic version of pretty much anything, has a recipe with anchovies for Green Goddess dressing.&#0160; While I like anchovies, I really don&#39;t cook with them at home.&#0160; So I&#39;m looking for alternatives for that same style dressing that use something else in its place. Some suggestions: for anchovies, substitute tarragon; for anchovies, substitute miso or fermented black beans; bacobits; A Green Goddess recipe from The Veggie Table with 1c fresh parsley Epicurious (Bon Appetit) Green Goddess recipe has 1c watercress Wikipedia notes an Annie&#39;s Naturals variant of this recipe using tahini.&#0160; Cookthink mentions the Annie&#39;s recipe, but their own Green Goddess recipe is with anchovies.&#0160; Annie herself prints an ingredient list.&#0160; Here&#39;s the Goddess Dressing: Ingredients: *Canola Oil, Water, *Tahini, *Apple Cider Vinegar, *Soy Sauce (water, *soybeans, sea salt *wheat), *Lemon Juice, Sea Salt, *Garlic, *Sesame Seeds, *Parsley, *Chives, Xanthan Gum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-01-11-vegetarian-green-goddess-dressing/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The family recipes for polenta all involve stirring for a long time, but I didn&#39;t want to do that.&#0160; This alternative approach showed up in a search for the delicious tag polenta, from the blog Hungry Cravings - the so called Cheater Method Polenta. The critics were skeptical: Vaguery: @vielmetti no-stir polenta sounds like no-water soup. Possible, but unlikely. Good luck! but it turned out fine - no stir is an exaggeration, more like one or two stirs but not more than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-01-baked-polenta-no-stir-polenta-sounds-like-no-water-soup---possible-but-unlikely/">&raquo;</a></p>

Egg and tomato might sound like an odd combination, but this is a really common Chinese dish which can be found on the menu at every cheap and cheerful Chinese eatery in Beijing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-10-14-scrambled-eggs/">&raquo;</a></p>
