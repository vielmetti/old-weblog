      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aardvark is &lt;a href=&#34;http://vark.com/&#34;&gt;vark.com&lt;/a&gt; - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &amp;quot;your network&amp;quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&amp;#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &amp;#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&amp;#39;s capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might simply be that I&amp;#39;ve been at it too long and my non-random sources for answers to random questions are just better. &amp;#0160;If you&amp;#39;ve collected enough mailing lists full of &lt;a href=&#34;http://group.yahoo.com/group/a2b3&#34;&gt;local people&lt;/a&gt; or topical experts or &lt;a href=&#34;http://listserv2.michigan.gov/wa.exe?A0=michlib-l&#34;&gt;reference librarians&lt;/a&gt;, the appeal of asking an unspecified audience is limited. &amp;#0160;Ditto the comparison with asking the same question to Twitter where it might ping-pong into someone&amp;#39;s news stream, or asking a network full of PR people on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helpareporter.com/&#34;&gt;HARO&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of luring in someone&amp;#39;s publicist who is happy to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
