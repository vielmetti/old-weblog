      <description>Aardvark is vark.com - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &amp;quot;your network&amp;quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&amp;#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &amp;#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&amp;#39;s capable of doing.</description>
