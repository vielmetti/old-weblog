      <description>Ben from Damn Arbor notes that the juneberries in town are in bloom, which means that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be more than about a month before they are ready for street-side snacking.&amp;#0160;
The forager in me always welcomes street trees that provide impromptu nutrition. Arborwiki has a brief list of some of the places where you can find juneberries downtown; surprisingly, the municipal parking lots on the west side of downtown are ringed with these trees.</description>

      <description>telegraphic codes and message practice Buell&amp;#039;s Mercantile Cypher (1860) appears on eve of the Civil War and near the end of the canal transport for which it provides language. Code compilation was still tentative at this time; its phraseology is practical but too specific and even politely long-winded, giving it the tone of an exercise book. The nature of the markings throughout the present copy suggest that it was used for preparation for another code, based on and incorporating some, and rejecting much else, of its content.</description>

      <description>Every year the U of Michigan teaches a Woody Plants class.&amp;#0160; I didn&amp;#39;t take it when I was in school, but my sister did, and it&amp;#39;s one of these legendary courses that people remember for a long time.
Here&amp;#39;s the links and notes I could find easily.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s prompted by the Ann Arbor Chronicle&amp;#39;s story about the city of Ann Arbor tree inventory going on now, which I hope will yield a precise map of where all of the public juneberry trees are.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Kate from Four Obsessions, here are seven food-related things to share.
1.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; From an early age I was taught what was good to eat in the north woods and how to find it.&amp;#0160; If you&amp;#39;re walking with me and suddenly I dive into the bushes and come up with a handful of berries, you&amp;#39;ll understand.&amp;#0160; Locally this means that the first day of blueberry, raspberry, juneberry, and strawberry season are holidays, and I employ a small army of berry-picking advance scouts to keep me informed of when opening day is and how conditions are.</description>
