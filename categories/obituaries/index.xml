      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fournier, Thomas James 6/27/1925 - 11/7/2014 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Tom_Fournier&#34;&gt;Tom Fournier&lt;/a&gt; died peacefully with family by his side on November 7, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom was born on June 27, 1925 in Detroit, MI, to Christopher and Alice Fournier. He joined the Navy to fight in World War II and fought in the D-Day landing on Omaha Beach. After the war, Tom returned home to marry the love of his life, Joan, on June 1, 1946. Tom was proud of his wartime service and of the many accomplishments in his life including pursuing his doctoral degree in counseling. He loved to write stories about the many people he met; he loved to go camping; he loved to cook especially desserts. Tom was outgoing and made many friends in and around Ann Arbor, his beloved home town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom is survived by his eight children Julie Bloomfield, MaryAlice Galloway (Dennis), Tom Fournier, Jr. (Betty), Tim Fournier (Chris), Gay Marie Fournier (Rod Kroes), Amy Fournier, Joe Fournier (Molly), and Steve Fournier. His family legacy includes 14 grandchildren and 5 delightful great-grandchildren.

      <title>the daily birth and death</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-the-daily-birth-and-death/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media&#39;s coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it&#39;s an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libraries have traditionally clipped obits in the service of local historians and genealogists to help the info seeker. From time to time I have posted or reprinted obits here, and Arborwiki collects them as well, unevenly but diligently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you have if your collection had every obituary printed for a city, carefully indexed and cross referenced? The big challenge I can imagine is disambiguation, making sure that you can tell the many people apart who share a name and a home town. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obituary: James Doyle, Lower Burns Park resident whose home was rehabbed by community groups in 2006</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jim Doyle, a long time Lower Burns Park resident, passed away late last month at the Grand Rapids VA.  Mr. Doyle had lived at 1023 Granger Ave. for over 50 years. He served in the Philippines on General MacArthur&#39;s staff during the war.  After the war, Mr. Doyle returned to Ann Arbor where after the passing of his parents, he spent the majority of his adult life taking care of his younger brother who was severely disabled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may remember Mr. Doyle from the efforts to &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060727194215/http://www.ewashtenaw.org/news/2006/doyle_home.html/Assets/aa_news_james_doyle.pdf&#34;&gt;refurbish his house&lt;/a&gt; by Veteran groups back in 2006.  Mr. Doyle was a friendly man who always had a smile on his face and a penchant for whole milk and chocolate candy bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Graydon Krapohl for the information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook and obituaries, part 2</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-18-facebook-and-obituaries-part-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people&#39;s families. It&#39;s a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven&#39;t missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that Facebook is good at capturing people&#39;s thoughtfulness in the moment, it&#39;s a lousy place to publish anything enduring. That&#39;s why when a proper obituary is written I like to cut and paste it out of wherever it has been and post it here. It seems that unless you do that the words so carefully and lovingly written disappear, either into the unsearchable maw of Facebook or into the tattered yellow clippings of a typical newspaper obituary site. You&#39;ll see a few of them in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/obituaries&#34;&gt;obituaries&lt;/a&gt; category here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written previously about &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/07/facebook-and-obituaries.html&#34;&gt;Facebook and obituaries&lt;/a&gt;, so this is more a reminder and a capture of a few thoughts than something earth-shakingly new. I have to wonder how the net will evolve over time and whether some hip new service of the moment will transform into something that people use to share their time of grief.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obituary: Greg Peters, 50; Louisiana political cartoonist</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-02-obituary-greg-peters/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 23:26:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-02-obituary-greg-peters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;An &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bestofneworleans.com/blogofneworleans/archives/2013/08/02/suspect-device-cartoonist-greg-peters-dies&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;obituary for Greg Peters&lt;/a&gt; is in Gambit, a New Orleans publication that he contributed political cartoons to. I knew him from high school in Marquette (from debate and High School Bowl) and hadn&#39;t stayed in touch for years, so this was a bit of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;Greg-peters-high-school-bowl&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901e97a6b3970b-600wi&#34; alt=&#34;Greg-peters-high-school-bowl&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom, from left: Tom Baldini (coach), me (alternate), Greg Peters, Joel White, Kerry Johnson, Mike Coyne, David Goldsmith (host). &#34;Nothing you learn is ever wasted.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obit as published in NOLA.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartoonist and writer Greg Peters died Friday morning, Aug. 2, after emergency surgery at Ochsner Medical Center. Mr. Peters, who had suffered from a congenital heart condition throughout his life, was 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in Marquette, Mich., Peters arrived in Louisiana in 1990 to pursue a doctorate in English literature at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He became best known as the creator of “Suspect Device,” a starkly crafted, blackly funny Louisiana-themed political comic strip that made its debut in 1996, in the Times of Acadiana, and ran in New Orleans’&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bestofneworleans.com/&#34;&gt;Gambit Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from 1999 to 2010. “Suspect Device” famously pulled no punches: In 1998, editor Harris Meyer resigned from the Times of Acadiana, when the paper’s publisher refused to run one of Mr. Peters’ strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Suspect Device” was recognized with awards from the Press Club of New Orleans and the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, and in 2004 was anthologized in “&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=r18Or31mODcC&amp;amp;pg=PT95&amp;amp;dq=greg+peters+attitude+2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=ih78UY3HG8iWqQHx7YFw&amp;amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=greg%20peters%20attitude%202&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Attitude 2: The New Subversive Alternative Cartoonists&lt;/a&gt;.” Mr. Peters’ work was displayed in exhibitions in conjunction with the book at New York City’s Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Peters was “one of the few alternative weekly political cartoonists whose mission is to skewer local and state politicians,&#34; anthology editor Ted Rall told Gambit’s Scott Jordan in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/unusual-suspect/Content?oid=1243221&#34;&gt;a 2004 profile of Mr. Peters&lt;/a&gt;. &#34;One would think that there would be such a cartoonist, or several, in every major city, but there just aren&#39;t,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coupled with an over-the-top clip-art style and incredibly distinct cartooning personality, Greg&#39;s strip is everything that his readers and editors can hope for.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Peters’ distinctive style involved the use of stock clip art images, arranged and annotated with wry, extensive text to skewer public figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;The clip art thing was always a punk staple,&#34; Mr. Peters told Jordan. &#34;Like the cut-out letters and clip art that Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols designer, did using Queen Elizabeth with the safety clip through her cheek picture. They&#39;re very much out of the DIY ethos. And the attitude simply of baseline mistrust for authority, and the demand that you be shown, not told.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Peters is survived by his parents, Reg and Kay Peters of Lafayette; his partner, Eileen Loh; his former wife, Saundra Scarce; and his two sons, Wilder, 12, and Magnus, 10. Plans for a memorial service in the New Orleans area are pending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More often than not, I am hearing about the death of friends or family through Facebook. I suppose this isn&amp;#39;t surprising; after all, I hear about babies born on the same site. Local newspapers are too slow or too local or publish too infrequently to be a source for family news. The Facebook wall makes as good a place as any to share condolences and to make plans for funerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huffington Post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/07/death-facebook-dead-profiles_n_2245397.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Death on Facebook Now Common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013) - inventor of interactive computing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Douglas Engelbart has died at the age of 88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/technology/douglas-c-engelbart-inventor-of-the-computer-mouse-dies-at-88.html?pagewanted=all&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;New York Times obit from John Markoff:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas C. Engelbart, a visionary scientist whose singular epiphany in 1950 about technology’s potential to expand human intelligence led to a host of inventions — among them the computer mouse — that became the basis for both the Internet and the modern personal computer, died on Tuesday at his home in Atherton, Calif. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engelbart was known for this 1968 (!) demo of interactive computing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/yJDv-zdhzMY?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story goes that while in World War II stationed on an island he read the Vannevar Bush work &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/&#34;&gt;As We May Think&lt;/a&gt;&#34;, and it became the foundation for his work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retraction watch: Joe Paterno</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-22-retraction-watch-joe-paterno/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-22-retraction-watch-joe-paterno/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note to self: never ever report anyone is dead. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/mgoblog/status/160963802345652224&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;MGoBlog&lt;/a&gt;, via Twitter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Penn State football coach Joe Paterno died January 22, 2012, of complications from lung cancer treatment. He was 85. Hours before, his death was prematurely announced by multiple news services, prompting retractions and apologies from those organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/16960572&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;CBSSports.com extends apology to Paterno family:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Saturday night, CBSSports.com published an unsubstantiated report that former Penn State coach Joe Paterno had died. That mistake was the result of a failure to verify the original report. CBSSports.com holds itself to high journalistic standards, and in this circumstance tonight, we fell well short of those expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://knightnews.com/2012/01/onward-state-managing-editor-resigns-joe-paterno-death-report-retraction/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Onward State Managing Editor Resigns After Paterno Death Report&lt;/a&gt;, Knight News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twitter account that first reported former Penn State coach Joe Paterno died just posted an update linking to a letter of resignation from its managing editor, Devon Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the normally reputable national CBS Sports outlet picked up the student news source’s story, the now-retracted report of Paterno’s death went national.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Breaking News:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.breakingnews.com/post/16271185670/the-paterno-story-what-went-wrong&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The Paterno story: What went wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our editor noted that CBS Sports — a trusted source —&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/joe-paterno-reports-start-internet-firestorm/2012/01/21/gIQAJPUNHQ_blog.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;Paterno’s death around 9pm ET. The CBS Sports headline and story was based, seemingly, on erroneous reporting by the Penn State student publication ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onwardstate.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Onward State&lt;/a&gt;.’ The original CBS Sports obituary didn’t directly attribute the student paper.&amp;#0160; The Huffington Post followed with a&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitpic.com/8a4wyv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SB Nation:&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/2012/1/22/2724607/explaining-the-reports-of-joe-paternos-passing-and-an-apology&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Explaining The Reports Of Joe Paterno&amp;#39;s Passing And An Apology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before publishing, we waited for multiple reports from national outlets. The reports spread to numerous trusted sources, sparking our own decision to publish a post as a result. It was based not on our own reporting, but on the reporting of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://storify.com/jeffsonderman/false-reports-of-joe-paterno-s-death&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Jeff Sonderman has a chronicle on Storify of the false reports and retractions&lt;/a&gt;. Many in the news media waited for the AP report before running a story, and thus they were spared the need to reverse themselves. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2012/01/joe_paterno_is_very_sick_but_c.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Penn Live has the family&amp;#39;s reaction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Paterno is not dead.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about as blunt as it gets, as sources close to the Paterno family say that the family is tremendously upset with&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eye-on-collegefootball.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/24156338/34497800&#34;&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myfoxphilly.com/dpp/sports/penn_state/reports%3A-joe-paterno-dies-at-age-of-85-012112&#34;&gt;other news media&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;who have erroneously reported Paterno&amp;#39;s passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, though, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20563737,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;People Magazine still has an obituary online&lt;/a&gt;, citing the CBS Sports article as its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is a nod to the weblog &lt;a href=&#34;http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Retraction Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks retractions in the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obituary: Faye Amo (1954-2011), high school French teacher</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-14-obituary-faye-amo-1954-2011-high-school-french-teacher/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;MARQUETTE – Faye M. Amo, age 57, of 425 West Ridge Street, Marquette, entered eternal life Wednesday evening, July 13, 2011, at her home in the loving care of her family and the caregivers of Upper Peninsula Home Health and Hospice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Born March 23, 1954 in Lima, Ohio, a daughter of Stephen J. and Ethel (Salidas) Catel, Faye was raised in Ishpeming and graduated from the Ishpeming High School as salutatorian of her class. From her days in grade school, Faye held the desire to become a teacher. She enrolled at Northern Michigan University, where she received her baccalaureate degree summa cum laude (with highest honor) with a double major in French and English. She continued at Northern, obtaining a double masters degree in English and French in 1977 and later studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris where she earned highest honors in French.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Faye’s lifelong dream of becoming a teacher began with her first teaching assignment at the Ishpeming High School in 1977. In 1979, she started teaching French at the Marquette Senior High School, a career that would span 31 years. Teaching French was her passion in life and she loved all her students and they loved her. Affectionately known as Madame Amo, she was the consummate professional teacher, one who truly cared about her students and was dedicated to their education and well-being.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It was not enough that the students learned the French language, she felt they needed to experience what “French” meant. Heading the French Club at Marquette Senior High School, Faye planned numerous trips for club members to big city museums to view French art exhibits, eat at French eateries, and learn about French culture. Over the years, several trips were taken to Chicago and to France in her mission to educate. These memorable events were always anticipated by Faye and greeted with enthusiasm by her students. For a number of years, she served as class advisor, particularly enjoying building and decorating floats for homecoming and decorating the gym for junior prom activities. Throughout her life, Faye maintained an untiring interest in the students at MSHS, often asking parents about their children, even through the children may never have been her students and she kept in regular contact with students who were now living adult lives, with families of their own.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In addition to her affiliations at MSHS as foreign language department head for several years, class advisor for the MSHS graduating class of 2008, and serving on numerous parent-teacher committees, Faye was also a member of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption and the Ladies Philoptochos Society, and active in civic committees such as the American Association of University Women and the Marquette Beautification Committee. In her leisure, Faye loved walking her dog, Mario, for the 13 years of his life, bicycling, running – even participating in marathons in Detroit and France, and riding in her boat on beautiful Lake Superior.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Faye is survived by her husband, John; her cherished son, Bret; two sisters, Stephanie (Bob) Trumm and Jayme (Rick) Iknoiah both of California; her mother-in-law, Leone Amo of Ironwood; brothers-in-law, Tom Amo of Philadelphia, PA, Jim (Brooke) Amo of Livonia, and Ken Amo of Ft Worth, TX; and several nieces and nephews. Faye was preceded in death by her father, the honorable judge, Stephen J. Catel, her mother, Ethel Catel; brother-in-law, Andrew Walton; and father-in-law, John M. Amo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The family will receive friends at the Swanson-Lundquist Funeral Home on Sunday from 4:00 pm until 7:00 pm. Trisagion will be held at 6:00 pm. The Funeral Liturgy will be held on Monday, July 18, at 11:00 am at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption with Rev. Tom Michalos officiating. Burial will be made in the Park Cemetery. Pallbearers will be Jimmy Pedakis, Lou Roumanis, Paul Andronis, Paul Wainio, Gary Shaffer, and Craig Cox. Memorials may be directed to the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption, 235 W. Ridge Street, Marquette, MI 49855 or to the Faye Amo Scholarship Fund, Wells Fargo Bank, 101 W. Washington Street, Marquette, MI 49855. Condolences may be expressed online at www.swansonlundquistfuneralhome.com Adieu Madame Amo. Repose en paix.&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gil Scott-Heron (b. April 1, 1949; d. May 27, 2011) was a poet and musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538ec6086d970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538ec6086d970b&#34; alt=&#34;6t&#34; title=&#34;6t&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01538ec6086d970b-500wi&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obituaries: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2011/05/27/136731274/gil-scott-heron-poet-and-musician-has-died&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;NPR, by Daoud Tyler-Ameen&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/05/27/us/AP-US-Obit-Gil-Scott-Heron.html&#34;&gt;Associated Press / New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson.  Written after Scott-Heron had recorded &#34;I&#39;m New Here&#34; but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around the middle seventies when I first heard this brazen, young black man&#39;s voice. He was angry! We were angry! I was angry! Angry over the fact that it was a few years ago that they had just taken from us our black shining Prince. He was mad. We were mad. I was mad! Mad over the fact that our struggle for freedom had come to a screeching halt. He was loud! Loud and determined to be heard. And I heard him. I heard him loud and clear. I heard him when he said &#34;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&#34;. I heard him when he said &#34;No Knock On My Brothers&#39; Head&#34;. I heard him when he was saying that the spirit of Brother Malcolm will flourish in him as it has in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Searches on Google under “news” are not showing any pages at five past three. It’s Gil Scott-Heron. You really do want to be sure before you write this up as a news source. No matter who crows about who was first on the web to break a story, trust is the currency. Trust and accuracy so, I am not surprised that the mainstream houses are not publishing yet.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert L. &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot; Frost&lt;/strong&gt; (1952 - March 2011) was a professor at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.si.umich.edu&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;University of Michigan School of Information&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#0160;received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983 and joined the University of Michigan faculty in 2000. Frost was the great-grandson of poet &lt;a href=&#34;http://rfrost.people.si.umich.edu/misc/poet.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/a&gt;, and established the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umich.info/about-SI/news-detail.htm?NewsItemID=571&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Frost Open Access Fund&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;with royalties from his great-grandfather&amp;#39;s works to&amp;#0160;support faculty and student projects related to open access to information. He is survived by his wife&amp;#0160;Margaret Hedstrom; relations, colleagues, current and former students and many friends. Donations may go to the American Cancer Society via &lt;a href=&#34;http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Team Frost&lt;/a&gt;. Additional details are pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a memorial service for Bob Frost held on &lt;strong&gt;Friday, April 15 at 3:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; at the Michigan Union Ballroom in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frost was interviewed for Michigan Today in Winter of 1996, in a story published under the title &lt;a href=&#34;http://michigantoday.umich.edu/96/Win96/mta4w96.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Robert Frost&amp;#39;s great-grandson is not a big fan of the poetry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of Bob&amp;#39;s friends, colleagues and students have written in memoriam, collected in small part here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Matienzo: &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesecretmirror.com/blog/2011/03/27/in-memoriam-bob-frost/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;In memoriam&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;Most importantly, he was a faculty member in a huge and ever-growing graduate program who seemed to enjoy nearly every interaction he had with a student, and encouraged us to reach out to him to send him links to &amp;quot;cool stuff&amp;quot; on the Web that might interest him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Michigan School of Information Dean Jeffrey Mackie-Mason announced his death with this message, which was circulated widely and is reproduced here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Date: Sat, Mar 26, 2011 at 11:49 PM&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear friends, students, colleagues&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is with deep personal sadness that I write to tell you that Bob Frost has passed away. He expired while resting at home, with his wife &amp;ndash; our colleague Margaret Hedstrom &amp;ndash; and family members by his side. &amp;#0160;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As many of you know, because Bob was a delightfully transparent and honest person, he has been fighting cancer for nearly two-and-a-half years. &amp;#0160;He had remarkable courage, and fortitude (the initial prognosis was that he had less than a year to live). Bob was passionate about teaching, about his students, and about our School. &amp;#0160;He insisted on continuing to teach a full load, and even developed new courses during his illness. &amp;#0160;Remarkably, he was still in the classroom teaching SI 500 less than three weeks ago. &amp;#0160;Many generations of undergraduate and graduate students have been touched by Bob; many of them say that he had a transformative impact on their choice of major and career. &amp;#0160;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bob was born in 1952, and received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Wisconsin in 1983. He came to Michigan as a visiting associate professor of history in 1995, and joined the SI faculty in 2000. For more information about his many publications, his teaching and his other interests, see&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/&#34;&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rfrost/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bob was passionate about many things, including a passion for sharing information for the good of all. &amp;#0160;Bob and Margaret established the Frost Open Access Fund by donating the royalties that Bob receives from the works of his great-grandfather, poet Robert Frost. &amp;#0160;The fund was also named to honor Bob&amp;#39;s friend and colleague Olivia Frost, SI&amp;#39;s former interim dean and professor emerita. &amp;#0160;The Frost Fund supports innovative projects that utilize open source software, or that study or promote the open access movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have known Bob since shortly after he arrived in Ann Arbor, and over the years was proud to become his friend. &amp;#0160;His death is a great loss to me, and I know it is to many of you as well; I share my sympathy with all of you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of activities are planned to help us address our grief, and to remember Bob. &amp;#0160;One is a fundraiser for cancer research that his students started a week ago in honor of Bob&amp;#39;s battle: if you wish, you may contribute through the American Cancer Society at&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost&#34;&gt;http://main.acsevents.org/goto/teamfrost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#0160;We will announce details of other activities soon. &amp;#0160;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For now, please join me in a moment of silent reflection in Bob&amp;#39;s honor. &amp;#0160;And please join me in extending support and sympathy to Bob&amp;#39;s loving wife, and our friend and colleague, Margaret Hedstrom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jeff&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamb, Robert Jeffrey &amp;quot;Jeff&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ffej&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Honey Bunny&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 16, 1949 - March 22, 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff was born in Oberlin, Ohio, and shortly afterward his family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He attended public schools in Ann Arbor and earned a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the University of Michigan. In 1978, Jeff moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, a city he loved dearly until the day he died. It was there that he met his loving wife, Leyla, who was visiting New Orleans from Hannover, Germany. Jeff and Leyla were married in Ann Arbor in 1986 and lived there happily until his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff was a professional photographer whose extraordinary photographs of New Orleans, Detroit, Ann Arbor and the Leelanau Peninsula will stand the test of time. He showed his love for New Orleans by documenting the architecture of the city and worked closely with the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. After Jeff moved back to Ann Arbor, he continued his photography career and established many professional contacts throughout the world. His work has been influential, especially after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and destroyed many of the homes of which Jeff had taken photographs. He established deep connections with other photographers in New Orleans and made many close friends there through Facebook.&amp;#0160;Jeff also photographed historic homes in Ann Arbor and was instrumental in trying to save the Ann Arbor Seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff was preceded in death by his parents, Jane and Robert Lamb; and sister, Susan. He is survived by his wife, Leyla Lau-Lamb; his dog, Sonny; a cousin, David (Susan) Emmett of Howell, Michigan; nephew, Bryan Emmett (Shawnee); niece, Kelin Emmett; and many friends around the world who miss him terribly. He was one of a kind. There will be a celebration of Jeff&amp;#39;s life at Hathaway&amp;#39;s Hideaway, 310 S. Ashley, Ann Arbor, on April 9th beginning at 4:00 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Jeff&amp;#39;s name to The Advocacy Department of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans, 923 Tchoupitoulas St., New Orleans, LA 70130.&lt;/p&gt;
