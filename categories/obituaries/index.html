            <p>One of the bitterest criticisms I have heard of late of what is left of our local media's coverage of town is their inability to function as a simple daily log of births and deaths. When a prominent local citizen dies, you expect a proper story told of their life. This is a service to friends and neighbors to get them to the b funeral on time, and it's an opportunity to reflect on a life well lived. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-the-daily-birth-and-death/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Facebook seems to be the place where I find out about deaths in people's families. It's a little jarring sometimes to have a newsfeed of cat video, advertisement, funny meme, obituary, cat video etc. It certainly makes me want to read down far enough in my feed that I haven't missed anything.
For all that Facebook is good at capturing people's thoughtfulness in the moment, it's a lousy place to publish anything enduring. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-18-facebook-and-obituaries-part-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

 Douglas C. Engelbart, a visionary scientist whose singular epiphany in 1950 about technology’s potential to expand human intelligence led to a host of inventions — among them the computer mouse — that became the basis for both the Internet and the modern personal computer, died on Tuesday at his home in Atherton, Calif.

Los Angeles Times written by Randall Roberts for the blog Pop and Hiss:  Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson. Written after Scott-Heron had recorded "I'm New Here" but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-27-obituary-gil-scott-heron-1948-2011-american-musician-and-poet/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>My cousin Zorba wrote a eulogy for my great uncle Auch, who died last week at the age of 96. The whole thing is a bit too much to share right now, but there was one paragraph that really spoke to me about the sort of family I come from (and perhaps some insight into who I am)  In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-04-eulogy-for-alfi/">&raquo;</a></p>
