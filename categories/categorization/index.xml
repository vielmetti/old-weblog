      <title>Levenshtein distance for approximate match</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem, simply stated, is that of typoes and inconsistent
spelling and pluraliziation. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a collection of
text that you want to annotate with some metadata, like categories
and tags. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to set aside ahead of time exactly which
tags you want to use, but you want to catch through some test or
lint step that you&amp;rsquo;ve done something wrong by typing &amp;ldquo;apples&amp;rdquo; into
a field that really has &amp;ldquo;apple&amp;rdquo; most of the time. A good algorithm
will catch minor deviations from the norm and advise you when you
should go back with a fresh pair of eyes and do an edit.
The bigger problem is &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;deduplication&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first pass at a proposed solution was to look for a version of
the old Unix program &amp;ldquo;uniq&amp;rdquo; that would have an approximate match.
There is also an old Unix program &amp;ldquo;agrep&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;approximate grep&amp;rdquo;) from
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Udi Manber&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[WM92a]
Wu S. and U. Manber, &amp;ldquo;Agrep - A Fast Approximate Pattern-Matching
Tool,&amp;rdquo; Usenix Winter 1992 Technical Conference, San Francisco (January
1992), pp. 153-162.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these first lines of attack to see if someone had
completely solved the problem before did the trick, but some
searching around and a conversation with
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;John Hritz&lt;/span&gt;
hit the neuron that remembered the algorithm called the
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Levenshtein distance&lt;/span&gt;.
That led me to
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffbfff;&#34;&gt;Wikibook: Algorithm Implementation&lt;/span&gt;,
and its set of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Strings/Levenshtein_distance&#34;&gt;Levenshtein distance code&lt;/a&gt;. It so happened that there
was a very slow implementation in the bash shell included
in that collection that was a cut and paste and two lines of
code from being exactly what I needed. A little bit of glue
code in awk and I was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the problem with cut and paste two lines of code is that this
particular implmentation is very slow, albeit correct. Given the
choice between slow correct code and fast code that&amp;rsquo;s wrong (because
of the bug that you don&amp;rsquo;t yet understand), I&amp;rsquo;ll take the slow code
plus a comment and a writeup that describes how to make it faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m really after is just the pairwise comparison of a set
of words where the two words are close to each other. If the
distance between two words is greater than some threshhold, I don&amp;rsquo;t need
to go any further. That algorithmic shortcut isn&amp;rsquo;t in the library
codes that I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger question is how to write a
checklist
and implement it in code to make sure that a big body of work stays
internally consistent. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to have a
categorization
rule for your writers that says &amp;ldquo;always use the
singular&amp;rdquo;, but very much something different to have Test 38 in
your automated test corpus apply that rule and notice when it&amp;rsquo;s
wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>custom views of taxonomies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move
a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over
categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same;
the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that
look different. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should
be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of posts about books in the collection, which
should be connected to a lookup for that book in your favorite
bookstore or my favorite library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of people mentioned, and a people index would
be great so you can browse and not just search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m after improving the browsing experience, as much for
me as for anyone else. If you have to find things with a search
engine, you are stuck in a world where you have to know that something
has a particular name. By offering a browsing infrastructure first,
you cherrypick the best search terms and put them up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this will need pen and paper design&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Screen shot 2013-06-10 at 9.55.51 PM&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901d3de0c9970b-800wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Screen shot 2013-06-10 at 9.55.51 PM&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Open up a &amp;quot;New Post&amp;quot; window, start typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the categories on the right side of the screen - my screen, not yours. There&amp;#39;s an infinite scrolling list of them, from &amp;quot;Americana&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;zzz Draft Postings&amp;quot;. Somehow, categories became the wrong way to describe what is in this blog; aside from &amp;quot;Ann Arbor&amp;quot;, there&amp;#39;s few of them that have routine postings. But with almost 3000 articles written, it&amp;#39;s had to imagine any coherent way to recategorize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with categories, buckets, or really any hierarchical system for putting things in one place or another is that there&amp;#39;s always the new thing that defies categorization and asks for its own category. I&amp;#39;m not willing to have a big &amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; category, but I am willing to have an &amp;quot;Oklahoma&amp;quot; category that only gets a few posts a year (earthquakes, tornados).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used systems that depend heavily on categorization to make them work. You set up some kind of ongoing task depending on how things or (worse) people are sorted into buckets. Suddenly the world needs bright divisions between one kind of thing and another kind of thing, and any ambiguity about status has to collapse into a single value to make the system make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tools in my experience have been better than others for recategorization. I&amp;#39;ve written before about Maxthink, a 1980s era MS-DOS &amp;quot;idea processor&amp;quot; (still available in Windows) that has a concept of &amp;quot;binsort&amp;quot;, which is an extraordinarily rapid and keyboard-driven way to shuffle and reshuffle items into a hierarchy. That system never really got enough traction to be copied wholesale by any other system, and so it lives on in the world only through dim memories and hardcore users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reshuffling a tree with lots of existing categories is really hard work, because short of wiping out all previous categorization and starting anew you are almost guaranteed to have some vestiges of the old order in place as you&amp;#39;re trying to assert a new set of groupings. Even the infinitely flexible Wikipedia has this problem, as it inherited some parts of its classification system from older encyclopedias like Brittanica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I struggle with sorting through the contents and give up more often than not, relying instead on search rather than careful categorization to unearth old things and to draw relationships among nominally related works. It&amp;#39;s the problem that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;everything is miscellaneous&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;and too many things are interrelated and that my knowledge of the world too often seems a mile wide and an inch deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem of miscellany is the tendency of our Internet to rot out from under us, with old sites and old links disappearing as people redesign or move on or give up. There&amp;#39;s hardly any way to refer to something without quoting it nearly in full, for fear that when you want to go back to it there will be nothing there to see.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to be rambling, what was the point again? Oh, categories and their utter impossibility of reflecting the current real world and the horrific difficulties of rethinking them half way through your efforts to use them. It so happens that &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/categorization&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;I have a categorization category&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully has some relationship to this brief essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Category-diagram.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image from upload.wikimedia.org&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeab11984970d&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeab11984970d-600wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;image from upload.wikimedia.org&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia is going through one of its &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2013_April_24#Category:American_women_novelists&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;periodic existential crises&lt;/a&gt;, this time over the use of categories. A diligent editor created a category of &amp;quot;American women novelists&amp;quot; and began adding female novelists to it, and then removing them from the category &amp;quot;American novelists&amp;quot;. A predictable hue and cry ensued. James Gleick tells the story in some detail in the NY Review of Books, under the title &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/29/wikipedia-women-problem/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&amp;#39;s Women Problem&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorization is hard in a Wikipedia world. The namespace for articles is flat, so there&amp;#39;s no implicit categories assigned simply by what a page is named. On the other hand, categories can contain subcategories, and the Wikipedia editors take advantage of this to create elaborate categorical structures. Everything is part of something else, in some extended rhetorical tangle. (The image is from the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Wikipedia:Categorization&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories don&amp;#39;t have to have subcategories, of course; that&amp;#39;s a convention that&amp;#39;s not universal to all wiki software. Localwiki&amp;#39;s equivalent structure looks more like tags, and tags are in one big flat namespace with no explicit hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally the choice is how to best improve findability of articles, and how to incorporate a distinctive feel to a system. Wikipedia has &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Doughnuts&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Category:Doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, with one subcategory &amp;quot;Doughnut shops&amp;quot; which in turn has a subcategory &amp;quot;Tim Hortons&amp;quot; which in turn has 12 pages, including Timbits. Arborwiki has a page &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Donuts&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Donuts&lt;/a&gt;, which includes pages tagged with the tag &amp;quot;donuts&amp;quot;, and is in turn tagged as &amp;quot;Pastries that are not strange&amp;quot;. (And yes, there is a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/tags/pastriesthatarestrange&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Pastries that are strange&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; tag as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a problem when the technically correct task of splitting a big category into smaller parts runs smack into the political minefield of deciding which part of the category is to be primary and which is to be secondary. No one wants to be secondary, and no reasonable system would always yield category warring. Perhaps Wikipedia has bumped up against some size limit where it&amp;#39;s impossible for any one person to understand the complexity of the classification system it has built.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Losing the categorical imperative</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-24-losing-the-categorical-imperative/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JNMK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00006JNMK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=superpatron-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;10px&#34; src=&#34;http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B00006JNMK&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=superpatron-20&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=superpatron-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00006JNMK&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&amp;rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them. A good, tidy, modern blog that is comprehensive in some narrow sphere would have a tidy list of categories and would post in each of them regularly enough to be helpful. In contrast, a laundry list of one-time enthusiams just makes it pointedly clear when my interests have waxed and waned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Typepad doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a straightforward way to &amp;ldquo;pin&amp;rdquo; a blog post to the top of a category, the same way that it can mark a post to stay on top of the main page. That makes it trickier to create permanent navigation within a category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope to put together some better navigation, so that someone coming to the blog for the first time can read some more popular posts or ones that I like. The whole thing has long since gone from a narrow, coherent narrative and turned into an unpolished open notebook, gathering scraps from here and there and not always pieces that have an obvious relation to the work as a whole. If it were a real scrapbook it would have tape-tags sticking out of it at all angles in all colors flagging things that deserve to be seen again; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be done with categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>System mapping</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-system-mapping/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always good to collect a lot of examples as you look to map out a system. For that you want to have generative tools that suggest the kinds of examples that you want to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/power-outage-maps.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;power outage maps I have been collecting&lt;/a&gt; started with the generative system of making a blank entry for each of 50 states, and looking to collect one in each state. I&amp;#39;ve done similar exercises where the generator is the first letter of the alphabet collecting examples A-Z. You are looking for breadth in your view, and something that constrains the search so that you don&amp;#39;t spend too much time in one place before going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to have some kind of rudimentary ranking algorithm when wrapping up your search, so that you can look for gaps into which another example will fit. The utility map effort looks like it&amp;#39;s going to generate a simple checklist for each map, so that I can give each one a score on completeness (0 = no map, add 1 for county by county stats, add 1 for city by city stats, add 1 for zoom to the outage, add 1 for systemwide counts etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the things you collect into categories that have names, so that you can start working with abstractions instead of concrete instances. The list of categories becomes another place to generate a bounded set of additional elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all of these you can start to think about plausible things that might be in the system that you haven&amp;#39;t found yet. My piece on &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2011/06/unknowledge-management.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;unknowledge management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (the phrase is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.munnecke.com/papers/dragons.htm&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;from Tom Munnecke&lt;/a&gt;) where the task becomes looking for names for things that don&amp;#39;t exist yet but that might plausibly exist given the system that you have described. This means that you end up with something peculiar to search for, and either it doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet, it can&amp;#39;t exist (and your models are off), or you find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the iterative process looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;describe a search space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;collect examples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;rank along common attributes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;categorize into abstractions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;synthesize the undiscovered instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that seems to be as good a plan as any for survey of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jhsph.edu/clf/programs/eating/proj_foodsystem.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;food system map of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;looks like an instance of the structure of this work. In academia, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=survey+article&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholart&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;survey article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(Google Scholar) is structured in much the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&amp;#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. &amp;#0160;This blog has a &amp;quot;garlic mustard&amp;quot; tag, which signals that I should write about that at least once a year; without that reminder, somehow I might miss that opportunity to refresh that annual recipe opportunity. &amp;#0160; The category list is long, but finite, and it&amp;#39;s idiosyncratic to reflect some peculiar sense of evolved focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags are much harder, especially in a world of tags shared across a team. &amp;#0160;There are enough variant spellings and punctuation in an 8000 unit tag cloud to make it tough to see which of those tags are most useful. &amp;#0160;Perhaps I can carve out 20 or 30 to make my own, items to revisit repeatedly, but the system as a system does not constrain me as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very useful to have a bucket that can be usefully refilled periodically. &amp;#0160;At the cycle of once per year, the cumulative knowledge of paczki rituals or cudighi recipes makes each successive year easier. &amp;#0160;Monthly rituals leave room to breathe between attempts, and weekly cycles build up a substantial body of work in just a year. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways this is the mindless mindfulness approach to sustained productivity; don&amp;#39;t decide what of 1000s of things you might do, simply have one picked for you and then go at it with a strict deadline to get you to where you need to go until the next time. &amp;#0160;The effort can be impromptu and doesn&amp;#39;t require much explicit preparation, since you&amp;#39;ve primed the pump with previous work. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>working on metadata - stopped in your tracks and watched until you get it right</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sippey.com/2009/12/its-the-metadata-stupid.html&#34;&gt;Michael Sippey writes about Ben Hammersley writing about metadata.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote he pulls is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; color: #333333; &#34;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;So why do everything you can to &lt;strong&gt;keep metadata intact&lt;/strong&gt;? Because it’s from this information that new products can be automatically created, at a scale and rapidity that would be impossible otherwise. With every piece of metadata that you don’t throw away, you gain a factor more potential ways of slicing through your content and delivering it as a separate product, simply as a result of a database lookup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;Let me give a worked-out example of this, for starters.&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://annarbor.com&#34;&gt;AnnArbor.com&lt;/a&gt; uses Movable Type as a publishing platform; as a part of that, we have &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt; for each story. &amp;#0160;A staff of journalists tagging their stories creates a lot of tags (because you are writing about a lot of things) and a few tags with a lot of stories (because you are writing a lot of stories about those things).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;Keeping a collaboratively maintained set of tags sane is work (in the same way that moderating comments is work; but that&amp;#39;s another post). &amp;#0160;When you are writing on a deadline, &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;#39;t have the luxury to work out every last possible reuse of your work&lt;/strong&gt;, and so you don&amp;#39;t tag aggressively. &amp;#0160;When you are copy editing, you might well have a reason to use or prefer a specific tag, in part because it lets you direct readers to previous coverage on the topic in a way that&amp;#39;s much simpler than specifically deep linking to each page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;What helps me keep some part of some of the metadata I care about within the AnnArbor.com world sane is to build links to the stories that I want to refer to from an outside source - in this case &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org&#34;&gt;Arborwiki&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;- and as I&amp;#39;m doing updates to that site use it as a &lt;strong&gt;sanity spot-check for coverage&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;#0160;Some &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Template:Newsrefs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wiki templates&lt;/a&gt; help speed the process of explicit linking, and an &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/city/Category:In_the_news&#34;&gt;internal category&lt;/a&gt; helps me figure out what fragment of the tag space I&amp;#39;ve covered. &amp;#0160;When I see a story that isn&amp;#39;t easy to link to from a relevant page, I go back and add the tag - not because it&amp;#39;s useful in the abstract, but because it&amp;#39;s relevant to one specific external instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;In this way I think that Ben is missing one of the elements of metadata, the element that says that &lt;strong&gt;you never really stop working on it&lt;/strong&gt;, and that simple repurpose through a database lookup only works when you are still actively editing the database. There&amp;#39;s nothing worse that going to a lot of work doing an attractively formatted page that&amp;#39;s driven by a database query against a database that you can&amp;#39;t control, and having to answer the question &lt;strong&gt;why a certain piece of unwanted data is there&lt;/strong&gt; and having someone &lt;strong&gt;stop you in your chair and watch over your keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; until it&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata only works when you un-meta it and deal with it again as data. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#0160;The list of metadata elements that I care enough to keep updating is not just meta; it&amp;#39;s a first class real list, one that has to be treated as a first class citizen and not just some accidental system artifact. &amp;#0160;Sometimes the metadata you expose just makes it clear how incomplete your first pass at storytelling was and what it takes to bring it back to the level of refinement that you expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;(tags: stopped watched; so meta it hurts; arborwiki)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 16px; &#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; &#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this post, and I don&amp;#39;t have a good category to put it in, so I have to create a category for it; but the process of creating the category describes some other set of things that could belong to it, and then by the time I am done with figuring out where it belongs inside my word-hoard posted to this blog I can go back and retroactively cross-post a half dozen other prototypical posts to that category so it looks like I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about it all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors to cite, preferably from my bookshelf, so that I can show a stack of books:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lakoff, &amp;quot;Women, Fire and Dangerous Things&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Sorting Things Out: Categorization and its Consequences&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;something by Ranganathan that I don&amp;#39;t have close at hand&lt;br /&gt;Tony Buzan on mind mapping&lt;br /&gt;Gould and White&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Mental Maps&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Your Creative Power&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;and something from Steven Winter on categories and the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheduled to post a week from today so that it has time to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
