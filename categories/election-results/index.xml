      <description>I think I voted today.
I used the Automark machine at my local polling place (U-M Coliseum). I&amp;#39;ve used this machine before many times, so I have figured out the easy parts of what can go wrong - for instance, on this machine you have to take the tab off the ballot before inserting it. But this time things went wrong, and I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure that my vote was counted when I inserted it into the tabulator.</description>

      <description>The original of this list is on the Ann Arbor City Clerk&amp;#39;s web site, but for some reason it&amp;#39;s a PDF. I&amp;#39;ve linked these to Arborwiki pages where they exist as I can.
If you&amp;#39;re looking for a Michigan sample ballot, see the Michigan Voter Information Center, at&amp;#0160;https://webapps.sos.state.mi.us/mivote/.&amp;#0160;

      <description>Two views of the Wisconsin recall election, in which Governor Scott Walker (R) survived a challenge from Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett (D). With 93% of precincts counted, Walker leads 54% to 45%.
The&amp;#0160;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel results map&amp;#0160;shows who won which county:

TheNew York Times coverage also shows the margin of victory, which puts the map into stark relief:

Compare this with theless clear Huffington Post interactive recall results margin graphic, which shows percentage size of lead on a county by county basis; that over-weights the color of rural counties, and underestimates the size of the urban difference in the total vote count.</description>

      <title>I voted; this year&#39;s Automark trial and error</title>

      <description>I used the Automark machine to vote today, as I did in 2010 (AnnArbor.com story) and in 2008 (Vacuum post).

This year&amp;#39;s voting excursion was harder, because the poll worker initially told me that I could not use the machine and that it was reserved for the handicapped. That was wrong; any voter in my precinct could use that system. The issue was resolved quickly.
For the first time, I used the audio interface and had the (one) issue on the ballot read out to me.</description>
