      <description>As monitored from Seismic Network Operations, IC MDJ, Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, China, this is an earthquake signature characteristic of nuclear testing. Or so that&amp;#39;s the working assumption: North Korea is doing nuclear testing.
What follows will be links, because I don&amp;#39;t know any more about this than what I find out from the media.
Nuclear Test Facility, Google Plus. This pinpoints the test facility, and gives its address as Nuclear Test Rd, North Hamgyong, North Korea.</description>
