      <description>AnnArbor.Crowdmap.com&amp;#0160;is an online system which has been collecting storm reports from the May 2011 flooding in Ann Arbor, as well as having in it previous information from past flood events and other incidents in Ann Arbor where there was widespread problems.
 Crowdmap&amp;#0160;is a tool that allows you to crowdsource information and visualize it on a map and timeline.
 I&amp;#39;ve typed in a bunch of these, but if you notice a news report of flooding, sewer spills, landslides, closed roads or fish flopping around on the road please add in a dot on the map with a link.</description>

      <description>First, Pluto was demoted.
Next, GM killed Saturn.
Then, Ford killed Mercury.
Now, Jupiter is under attack.
When will the madness end?
(thanks Rick Klau for reminding me of Saturn)</description>

      <title>quake lakes and Dave&#39;s Landslide Blog</title>

      <description>After an earthquake, landslides block river valleys, causing temporary lakes to form. Sometimes these lakes hold for a long time; in other cases, the earthen dam fails, causing flooding downstream.
The single best blog on the topic is Dave&#39;s Landslide Blog, from Dave Petley, who is the Wilson Professor at Durham University, UK. He&#39;s doing reporting on the Tangjiashan dam, and I won&#39;t even try to be up to date with that.</description>
