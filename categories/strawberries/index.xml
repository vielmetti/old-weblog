      <description>Strawberry season is on its way. Here&amp;#39;s some first estimates of picking times, based on email or postings from local U-Pick strawberry farms.
Rawsonville: Rowe&amp;#39;s Produce Farm has an active Facebook page, and doesn&amp;#39;t yet have details of when first harvest will be. Their strawberries survived earlier frost scares. No U-Pick raspberries this year. &amp;#0160;UPDATE: Rowe&amp;#39;s will open for the season on June 8, berries&amp;#0160;$1.78 per pound.
Ida: Whittaker&amp;#39;s Berry Farm (also on Facebook) is estimating first picking to start between June 10 and June 15, and notes that an average season is 18 days long.</description>

      <description>The early reports from strawberry growers that send out periodic newsletters to their perennial customers is that Michigan strawberries will be early this year. If you normally plan to pick on Father&amp;#39;s Day, you may be too late for the crop.
None of the places I track are yet announcing opening dates for picking, but I&amp;#39;ll share those when I have them; it&amp;#39;s looking more like Memorial Day as the beginning of the season, with peak picking dates typically 7-10 days after the first opening day.</description>

      <title>Strawberry season, 2011 report</title>

      <description>I went strawberry picking with my boys on Father&amp;#39;s Day at Rowe&amp;#39;s in Rawsonville. We picked two full trays of berries in what seemed like no time flat. The sun was not too hot, and the berries were not too ripe, and I think we nailed the right day to pick pretty much perfectly.
The challenge now is what to do with all of those berries. Some have been frozen, others are under sugar and hopefully will end up as sorbet, and still more get stored in the bellies of friends.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s collected reports from the places that I&amp;#39;m on mailing lists for U-Pick strawberry season for 2011 near Ann Arbor. Comments welcomed. &amp;#0160;The June 2011 &amp;quot;strawberry moon&amp;quot; (full moon) is June 15.
Whitaker&amp;#39;s Berry Farm in Ida, MI (about 30 miles S of Ann Arbor.)&amp;#0160;opens Thursday, June 9, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. U-Pick $1.30/#, $3.25/qt prepicked. &amp;#0160;&amp;quot;Those wanting real large amounts for canning and freezing, may wish to wait until closer to June 15th, which is when peak season should begin.</description>
