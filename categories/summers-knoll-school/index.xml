      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Facebook stream is full of pictures of kids on their first day of school. (That&amp;#39;s great!) Sorry that I don&amp;#39;t have a first day, or even a second day, photo to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day at our house featured a last-minute lunch prep (mac and cheese) and then two bicycle rides, one each for the 7th grader and for the 2d grader. The Burns Park school grounds were busy with a stream of parents and kids coming for dropoff; I haven&amp;#39;t seen the new Summers-Knoll morning rush yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all guesses it&amp;#39;s going to be a good year.&lt;/p&gt;
