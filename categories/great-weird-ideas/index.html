            <p>A cautionary tale.
What's the value of an idea? Consider that some ideas might have a negative value; indeed that most of them might. It may take you some substantial investment to test out your idea, to prove it, to build something minimal to show people that it was real. And then when you're ready with it there might be a net result that you finally have talked to enough people that you know that you need to scrap it and start over. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-14-that-bright-idea-of-yours-might-cost-you-25000/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I spent some quality time playing the dreadfully addictive game "2048". (No, I won't link to it.) After beating it a few times, I went looking for higher dimensional versions and found a 2048 3D, 4D, and 5D version. And, after playing and beating 2048 5D I am no longer satisfied with most of the user interfaces that I see. 5 dimensional thinking on a 2x2x2x2x2 board is really not all that hard, once you bend your mind to it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-07-how-are-you-going-to-keep-them-down-on-the-farm-after-theyve-seen-5d/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to keep up a daily pace to blogging here; that&#39;s been my habit for almost ten years. The problem is that it&#39;s not always easy to know what to write about.
I&#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-when-you-have-no-idea-what-to-write-use-randomness-in-your-favor/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>At what point did &quot;top of mind&quot; get replaced by &quot;top of page&quot; ? For people like me who spend a lot of time online, it&#39;s easy for social network systems like Twitter and Facebook to be a steady stream of distractions, especially when the usual clues for what is important get replaced simply by cues for what is new.
Some background for context.
The earliest use of the phrase &quot;top of mind&quot; that I can find in a modern context is Alin Gruber&#39;s Top of Mind Awareness and Share of Families (1969), a discussion in the Journal of Marketing Research on how closely the snap judgments that consumers make about brand recogition map to market share. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-26-top-of-mind-vs-top-of-page/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I find myself wanting to call people once in a while, and I also find that I know people&#39;s twitter names pretty well.
What is disappointing is that none of the tools I have let me &quot;dial by twitter name&quot; in the sense that there&#39;s no command line prompt that has a &quot;call&quot; verb which takes the twitter username as an object.
 % call @vielmetti
 Actually, I&#39;m at even a worse spot; I don&#39;t even have a &quot;call&quot; command to start from at the shell script prompt. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-13-dial-by-name-using-the-twitter-name-space/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>From The Unknowledge Pattern Language, on Nooron:
 Unknowledge Patterns describe ways of talking about that which is unknown. For example, the discovery of the periodic table of the elements created a pattern of information about what we didn&#39;t know about the elements, until we &quot;filled in the blanks.&quot; These &quot;named voids&quot; in our knowledge were powerful attractors, and shaped the discourse of science. Are there other ways of naming voids which shape our discovery? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-10-unknowledge-management/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&#0160;
The Twitter input box doesn&#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&#39;t pop for it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-09-my-great-weird-ideas-dont-fit-in-140-characters/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>May is almost over, and as always there is more I wish I would have done than was actually done. Some notes on things not written, in the hopes next year will bring another May (chances are good) and that I&#39;ll have some of these May stories written before then.

            <p>An essay published in Open Letters Monthly.
What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. I fear for our memory theaters. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-12-nathan-schneider-defends-the-memory-theater/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A comment I wrote on Ethan Hein&#39;s account of color-coding sequencer tracks:
When you say “color coding improved your ears”, the first thing that comes to mind is that you are doing some kind of machine-assisted synesthesia. very cool, that. another enticing pice from oblong industries
It&#39;s true that one of the elements is a blue ball that bounces in time to the music and touches down on the notes that are playing just then. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-11-assisted-synesthesia-as-augmented-reality/">&raquo;</a></p>
