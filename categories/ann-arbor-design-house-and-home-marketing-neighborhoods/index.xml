If your neighbor erects a giant sign on their lawn, or on the side of their house, what is your recourse?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
UPDATE: In Ann Arbor the simple and direct way to deal with this is to call the city&#39;s Community Standards department at &lt;a href=&#34;callto:1-734-994-1613&#34;&gt;734-994-1613&lt;/a&gt;.  A neighbor who has been through this before says that they deal with sign problems promptly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The appropriate part of the city code reads as follows.  NOTE: This is not the official city code site!  Find it and read it before complaining.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
