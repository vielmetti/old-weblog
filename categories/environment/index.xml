      <description>Platnick, N. I. 2008. The world spider catalog, version 9.0. American Museum of Natural &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; History, online at http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders/catalog/index.html
The World Spider Catalog is a thorough catalog of the scientific literature regarding spiders, with a special attention paid to classification and taxonomy.&amp;nbsp; The organization of the entries is hierarchically determined; hence synonymies at the &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; generic level are indicated under the family (and cross-referenced under the appropriate &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; generic) listings, but affected species are listed separately only if there are significant &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; references to them in particular.</description>

      <description>From my inbox:
My name is Sarah and Iâ€™m 12. I live in Ann Arbor. Recently, my family found a spider with a body about 3&amp;frasl;4 an inch in diameter and with legs it was bigger than a quarter. It is so huge! It is living in a big web between my house and some bushes. The web is made up of circles and the spider is only there during evening and night.</description>

      <description>Brad Gregory of Belding, MI (about 30 miles NE of Grand Rapids, MI) was bitten by a southern black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans Fabricius) on September 7, 2008.&amp;nbsp; The spider was found inside a Maytag dishwasher that his grandparents had purchased at Home Depot two weeks earlier.&amp;nbsp; He was treated at Spectrum Health System&#39;s Blodgett Hospital in East Grand Rapids, which had the antivenin on hand.
The best news article on this is from the Greenville, MI Daily News, which also includes a picture of Brad holding the spider in question.</description>

      <description>As a part of a continuing series on Michigan spiders, here are some images.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve identified them as best I can with Latin and common names.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be adding to this from time to time to make it as complete as I can; the end of this post has some more sources.

      <description>Every once in a long while, you run across something so wonderful you have to share.
I have been tracking hits to the Google search Michigan spiders, ever since an odd combination of page text about automated web browsing tools unearthed a bunch of folks trying to identify the spiders crawling across their day lilies.
Today&#39;s search logs turned up this amazing resource, the The Backyard Arthropod Project
A Field Guide to the North Side of Old Mill Hill, Atlantic Mine, MI.</description>
