      <description>&lt;p&gt;The theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues from different
branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems. The speakers
are active in their recognition of complexity in their respective
areas, ranging from language usage, structure, and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conference Schedule is available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://elicorpora.info/LLC/schedule&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://elicorpora.info/LLC/&lt;wbr /&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Free) Registration required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dates:&lt;/strong&gt; November 7-9, 2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Venue:&lt;/strong&gt; The Michigan League, University of Michigan&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a big additional amount of description of the event, from their web site:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
   &lt;h3&gt;Conference Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A
conference of invited presentations is to be held in Ann Arbor on
November 7-9 2008 to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Language
Learning and to explore a paradigm shift currently taking place across
the language sciences, the growing realization of Language as a Complex
Adaptive System.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt; Language Learning was first
published from the University of Michigan in 1948. Its subtitle then
was &amp;quot;A Quarterly Journal of Applied Linguistics&amp;quot;; indeed the beginnings
of &amp;quot;Applied Linguistics&amp;quot; have been attributed to this usage. In the 60
years since, the subtitle has evolved to become &amp;quot;A Journal of Research
in Language Studies&amp;quot; reflecting our mission: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language Learning is a scientific journal
dedicated to the understanding of language learning broadly defined. It
publishes research articles that systematically apply methods of
inquiry from disciplines including psychology, linguistics, cognitive
science, educational inquiry, neuroscience, ethnography,
sociolinguistics, sociology, and semiotics. It is concerned with
fundamental theoretical issues in language learning such as child,
second, and foreign language acquisition, language education,
bilingualism, literacy, language representation in mind and brain,
culture, cognition, pragmatics, and intergroup relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
   
   &lt;p&gt;The
conference in 2008 will mark our 60th anniversary and our remarkable
success towards these ends. Members of the board, past editors, our
colleagues at Wiley-Blackwell, and friends and confederates in this
enterprise are gathering to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The topic of
the conference is Language as a Complex Adaptive System. Recent
research across a variety of disciplines in the cognitive sciences has
demonstrated that patterns of use determine how language is acquired,
is structured, and changes over time. However, there is mounting
evidence that processes of language acquisition, use, and change are
not independent from one another but are facets of the same complex
adaptive system. This theme builds upon foundations laid by colleagues
from different branches of linguistics, psychology, and complex systems
(including Clay Beckner, Richard Blythe, Joan Bybee, Morten H.
Christiansen, William Croft, Nick C. Ellis, John Holland, Jinyun Ke,
Diane Larsen-Freeman, and Tom Schoenemann) at a meeting at the Santa Fe
Institute in 2007. &amp;quot;The Five Graces Group&amp;quot; (named after their rather
special accommodations there) are offering a position paper on Language
as a Complex Adaptive System as the introductory piece for the
conference followed by ten individual papers that discuss substantive
areas of language from this perspective. The authors of these ten
papers are active in their recognition of complexity in their
respective areas, ranging from language usage, structure and change,
sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, anthropology, language
evolution, first language acquisition, second language acquisition,
psycholinguistics and language processing, language education,
individual differences, and language testing. Discussion of these
papers will be led by members of the board of Language Learning in
order to contextualize these influences within Applied Linguistics and
the Language Sciences more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Written papers
based on these presentations will form a special issue of the journal
Language Learning (2009, Volume 59, Supplement 1). The proceedings will
also be recorded and later made available through Wiley-Blackwell and
the University of Michigan as a webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous day there&amp;#39;s a seminar on campus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;font color=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Emergence in Physical, Biological, and Social Systems III&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;November 7, 2008&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;340 West Hall, University of Michigan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9 am-4:30 pm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Talks and Poster Session open to the public&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our goal is to help
encourage the formation of a coherent community of researchers on
campus grouped around
the general theme of complexity, emergence, and collective effects.
This third ICAM meeting at the University of Michigan is timed to
connect to the University of Michigan conference on &lt;a href=&#34;http://elicorpora.info/LLC/overview&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Language as a Complex Adaptive System&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (Nov.8-9, 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
