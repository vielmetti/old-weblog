      <description>As it turns out, a detailed look at the way you spend time over the course of a day online yields several fascinating conclusions. As previously noted, Wakatime is the introspective tool of choice.
 Gee, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of time to look at Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail; Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you spending more of your productive time writing; I&amp;rsquo;ll bet that if you put down the computer your day would be more productive.</description>

      <description>The evening&#39;s work can be roughly summed up as
 Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with &#39;A&#39;. Much of the time, that will be a person&#39;s name.
 Comment on that person&#39;s weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch.
 Repeat until &#39;Z&#39;.
  In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on &#34;The algorithm driven day&#34;</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I&#39;ve added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I&#39;ve closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github&#39;s issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking.</description>

      <description>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can&#39;t, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up.
For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose.</description>

      <title>do next?</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-27-do-next/</guid>
      <description>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once, and it stuck.
A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on.</description>

      <description>So I&#39;ve given myself an arbitrary deadline; write until the battery runs out, and then plug in and don&#39;t use the computer again for the day. At the very least I will type faster when the timer ticks down to 0:04. (The phone still has power though.)</description>

      <description>I change productivity tools from time to time. Here&#39;s a latest try.
There are only two real rules with Personal Kanban: 1. Visualize your work 2. Limit your work-in-progress
I wrote about Personal Kanban before back in 2010, but I didn&#39;t try to put it into practice as such.
Boardthing is an invention of Dave Gray. There&#39;s a review of Boardthing from Chuck Frey which goes into a few more details, but the short summary of it is that it&#39;s a suitable way to rearrange little rectangles on a board.</description>

      <description>Getting things done includes deciding what not to do. In my case, it&#39;s a matter of going through my todo list and striking off the well-intentioned tasks from two or three months ago that took a moment to write and that would take hours to complete.
I&#39;m better off at accomplishing things when there are fewer undone things to choose from.

      <description>I&#39;m trying out Slack. Here are some first impressions.
The system has many familiar components. It feels like an IRC network, complete with a set of well thought out bots and useful integrations with development tools. Unlike most IRC nets, it comes with a rich set of web and native clients that make it feel like something that ordinary people could use and not just the ubergeeks. For the ubergeeks, it also has a very competent IRC client support.</description>

      <title>Limiting work in progress vs. the endless todo list</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using a todo system based on Github issues for the better part of a year. It&#39;s been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren&#39;t done yet but that need to be.
When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to &#34;do laundry&#34; (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens.</description>

      <title>Still answering yesterday&#39;s email; also doing yesterday&#39;s todos</title>

      <description>I&#39;m a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It&#39;s hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today&#39;s email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday&#39;s mail you are really done.
The slight complication for this system for me is that I&#39;m also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m thinning out my todo list for the new year to delete some of the oldest items, the ones that aren&#39;t particularly hard but they also haven&#39;t been done this past year.
I figure that if I need to do them, the opportunity will arise again, and it might be easier to get them done if they show up fresh at the top of the list rather than buried at the bottom.</description>

      <description>I use OneTab (see: previously) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there&#39;s a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m using Github as a personal issue tracker, still using it in fact for a whole year. It says that I&#39;ve crossed 1200+ things off my todo lists and still have 70+ left to go. Unlike &#34;inbox zero&#34;, I&#39;m resigned to the notion that my todo list will hover somewhere between 60 and 90 things to do at any time.
inbox zero just means that my todo list is full</description>

      <description>It&#39;s more like &#34;inbox three&#34; than &#34;inbox zero&#34; because of a couple of persistent stuck messages, and the todo list is full of items that I put on it ten months ago that still need to be done. That said, I&#39;m still happy with my issuetracker system, for which I&#39;m using Github&#39;s issues system as a personal productivity tool. It has a long memory, it&#39;s reliable, and the mobile tools for managing lists work nicely on my Android phone.</description>

 The 10,000 lb. gorilla of birthdays is Facebook, which offers a nice simple interface to send a one-line birthday greeting. You could visit Facebook daily just for birthdays and not much more, and be reasonably satisfied with the results.</description>

      <description>Yesterbox is a technique from Zappo&amp;#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &amp;quot;inbox zero&amp;quot; for today&amp;#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&amp;#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&amp;#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&amp;#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away.
The biggest problem with &amp;quot;inbox zero&amp;quot; is that it&amp;#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things.
The thought is that at some times I&amp;#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&amp;#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down.
The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out.</description>

      <description>There&#39;s nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you&#39;re online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly.
The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details.  I&amp;#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&amp;#39;s stumped me before. I&amp;#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked.  The key bit which I didn&amp;#39;t use before was a screwdriver.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I started using Github as an issue tracker to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&amp;#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&amp;#39;s some reflection on that use.  I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order.</description>

      <description>The phrase &amp;quot;task surfing&amp;quot; came to me, and I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what it means.
The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&amp;#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&amp;#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&amp;#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&amp;#39;s not that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve written about Supermemo before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&amp;#39;t overwhelm.</description>

      <description>A very brief writeup of a technique for doing online task management, in a world where there are so many social media channels that you need a spreadsheet to keep track of them all.
The software is Google Spreadsheet, used with a private sheet all for myself.
The structure of the worksheet is a set of columns, with column headings indicating the piece of software, online system, or media channel that you are tracking; the rows are dated or time stamped.</description>

      <description>The scuttlebutt is that delicious is going to be axed by Yahoo.&amp;#0160;
Once upon a time, I bookmarked everything interesting that came across my path to delicious (back when it was del.icio.us). &amp;#0160;It was part of my routine, and a daily summary was posted through to this blog.
Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it.</description>

      <description>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece. (This article will be no exception.) But the academic buzz around the subject isn’t just a case of eggheads rationalizing their slothfulness. As various scholars argue in “The Thief of Time,” edited by Chrisoula Andreou and Mark D.</description>

 1. Visualize your work 2. Limit your work-in-progress  to which is added a third, &amp;ldquo;prioritize&amp;rdquo;. The rest is commentary.
Jim is good at commentary, so the blog and the rest of the effort is well worth reading. Here&amp;rsquo;s Personal Kanban 101 to start.

      <description>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.
In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&amp;#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.
Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&amp;#39;s missing the lack is noted.</description>

      <description>Add you to my address book, and note carefully your telephone number and postal address.
Give you a call; thank you for your mail; ask some questions that came up as a result of the mail that were too complicated to answer in a followup email.
Send you a handwritten note as a follow up to the telephone call.
Locate you on culturally appropriate online social networks (not all of them, but which ever were sensible) and do the appropriate friending rituals; note any mutual friends.</description>

Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&amp;#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&amp;#39;re working on.</description>

What tool or application do you use?
Mobile twitter.&amp;#0160; Twitter your short notes out to the world, or use a direct message to some bot of some kind that collects and gathers the notes for you.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; Twitter&amp;#39;s mobile interface is fast, simple, and reasonably complete.</description>

      <description>on time tracking, in general, an observation from last year:

It&amp;#39;s hard to have great weird ideas when you&amp;#39;re tracking every minute to determine who it gets billed to. The cognitive overhead of deciding which part of your brain gets dinged for each good thought gets in the way of flow.
My days have a lot more specific time points where something needs to happen at a certain time, no compromises.</description>

      <description>Part of a series on reminder systems.
--
One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&amp;nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head.</description>

      <description>I wrote about SuperMemo some months back, but if I&#39;ve told you once, I&#39;ve told you 146 times: repetition is the very soul of the net.
SuperMemo is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&amp;nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory.</description>

      <description>In the manage by numbers world...
One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress. At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.
If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you&#39;d measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time.</description>

Keep track of what you do.  8. Keep track of what you promise to do.  9. Always carry something to write with.  10. Get enough sleep.

(Cyberspace, remember that, data gloves and VRML and the metaverse and all that? Yeah. There.)  There are two fundamental issues in time tracking for me: accurately logging the start and stop of each task, and determining which bucket of pre-assigned tasks it goes into (or determining that a new bucket needs to be allocated to describe that task).</description>

There are a lot of colorful sticky notes around my workplace these days, so I thought I&#39;d read up on how kanban-inspired systems are being used for process management in the software development and other non-manufacturing worlds.  Some inspiring examples (with post-its to illustrate):  Corey Ladas on Kanban systems for software engineering:  A perfect state of flow may be very difficult, or at least uneconomical, to achieve in a robust product development process.</description>

      <description>If you wait long enough, it won&amp;rsquo;t be novel, and thus it won&amp;rsquo;t be worthwhile to pay attention to. Thus by incorporating a delay loop into your news consumption you&amp;rsquo;ll miss a bunch of transient spikes of things that are no longer newsworthy.  http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/45/17599   Novelty and collective attention  Fang Wu and Bernardo A.

      <description>oh, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I look like from the net (via metro mode media)  Ed Vielmetti is Ann Arbor&amp;rsquo;s pied piper of Web 2.0 new urbanist geek culture and all round swell guy. A relentless networker and vital strand in the social and high tech spiderweb of A2 start ups and up starts, his blog is really more of a free-for-all of interesting links and informational tidbits. For short attention spans and expansive minds.</description>
