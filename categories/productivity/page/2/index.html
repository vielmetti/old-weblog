        <p>I&#39;ve written about Supermemo before, a system for focusing your attention on things that you have previously learned in such a way that you reinforce long term memory. Given a set of items which you were confident in at a stage in the past, identify a way to re-test yourself on that confidence. Space out those retest intervals so that you keep the learning from decaying into nothingness. Repetition is the very soul of the net, and if you are careful you can repeat at intervals that don&#39;t overwhelm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-06-supermemo-spaced-repetition-and-structured-randomness/">&raquo;</a></p>

Delicious was from the tags era of the Internet, where in addition to noting that a thing existed you could add your own tags to describe it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-12-17-alas-poor-delicious-you-knew-us-well/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Academics, who work for long periods in a self-directed fashion, may be especially prone to putting things off: surveys suggest that the vast majority of college students procrastinate, and articles in the literature of procrastination often allude to the author’s own problems with finishing the piece. (This article will be no exception.) But the academic buzz around the subject isn’t just a case of eggheads rationalizing their slothfulness.

        <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one.
In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-finding-buckets-to-refill-regularly/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>It&#39;s important to have tasks that provide unambiguous signals that you are making progress, even though individually those tasks do not seem significant.
Think of mindless mindfulness that lets you go diligently through a text and correct each of the small flaws that you notice. None of the flaws are burdensome, but there is need to accumulate evidence of care for a level of detail. Deep thought is not needed to do the work, but when it&#39;s missing the lack is noted. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-meaningless-indicators-of-progress/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you were at LA2M today you saw my new experimental presentation screen - two windows up, left hand side a browser running an iPhone emulator, right hand side a single column of Tweetdeck doing a search for the tag associated with the event.&#0160; Anyone who twittered to that tag got their twitter up on the screen a minute or three later.&#0160; (photo goes here)
Here&#39;s build notes for that, with the caveat that I am not 100% satisfied with it just yet, and it will probably get another tweak for the next preso. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-11-slightly-delayed-back-channel-for-meetings-with-twitter-tweetdeck/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mark Forster has a new productivity system which he calls Autofocus.&#0160; There&#39;s the obligatory blog, video, twitter account, glowing Lifehacker review etc etc.&#0160; If you care, you&#39;ll look them up.
Like many systems, this one relies on making one list and then working your way through it.&#0160; The twist on this system vs. some others is that for the most part there is very little attempt to produce metadata about the parts of your list that you&#39;re working on. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-15-autofocus-yet-another-productivity-algorithm/">&raquo;</a></p>

Mobile twitter.&#0160; Twitter your short notes out to the world, or use a direct message to some bot of some kind that collects and gathers the notes for you.&#0160;&#0160; Twitter&#39;s mobile interface is fast, simple, and reasonably complete. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-20-mobile-meeting-notes-and-mobile-social-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>on time tracking, in general, an observation from last year:

It&#39;s hard to have great weird ideas when you&#39;re tracking every minute to determine who it gets billed to. The cognitive overhead of deciding which part of your brain gets dinged for each good thought gets in the way of flow.
My days have a lot more specific time points where something needs to happen at a certain time, no compromises. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-13-on-tracking-the-minimum-aliquot-of-attention/">&raquo;</a></p>

One of the issues in medical care, especially care for patients with chronic conditions that require ongoing attention and monitoring, is making sure that both doctors and patients are reminded about appointments and tests according to what may be a complex schedule.&nbsp; On any individual basis this is not too hard to follow, but as a practice gets busy there may be more future events to be aware of than any one person can keep in their head. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-10-clinical-remind/">&raquo;</a></p>

Reminder systems are tools - paper, electronic, physical, or some mix of all of them - which prompt you to do something in the future. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-08-reminder-system/">&raquo;</a></p>

SuperMemo is a piece of software from P A Wozniak, originally developed in 1987 as a DOS program for learning languages.&nbsp; Wozniak, a student of molecular biology, was frustrated by the amount of knowledge he lost after cramming for an exam, and worked to develop methods for improving long term memory. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-12-supermemo-repet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>In the manage by numbers world...
One useful measure that people take on (or have forced upon them) is management of work in progress. At every step along the way in a multi-step effort, you have something not quite done, and a level of continuous improvement involves managing and monitoring that inventory of partly done work.
If, for instance, you were looking at an inbox, you'd measure the integral of the depth of the unanswered mail queue, so that productivity is in a sum of outstanding work measured over time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-30-management-metr/">&raquo;</a></p>
