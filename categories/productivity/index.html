        <p>The evening's work can be roughly summed up as Generate a random item from my personal wiki that starts with 'A'. Much of the time, that will be a person's name. Comment on that person's weblog, if they have one, or otherwise get in touch. Repeat until 'Z'. In the course of doing this I came across an essay, otherwise unpublished, on "The algorithm driven day". In reading through it I am not sure it needs to see the light of day just yet, but it does help me wonder what parts of our efforts are driven by randomness and which are put there by design and how on earth one might tell the difference. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-28-a-random-walk-through-the-rolodex/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've been tracking my personal todo list on Github for nearly two years now. When I first wrote up the experience I had just been using the standard web client for the system; since then I've added Octodroid as an Android client. So far so good, I've closed more than 2300 issues since I started. Github's issues is a completely feature-filled issue management system, far and above overkill for a personal todo list, but useful and complete enough to manage routine tasking. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-03-the-bee-app-a-multiplatform-issue-tracker-client-for-mac/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My laptop has been in the shop for more than a week. I am not keeping up with correspondence as a result. I apparently had an efficient enough system that for a given hour of focus I could answer or log as much mail as came in. Now I can't, and there are not enough hours in the day to catch up. For better or worse I have also rediscovered that I can write on this little device, and that blogging is about the right length for the small screen to compose. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-falling-behind-slowly/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One algorithm for deciding what to do next is simply to identify the item with the closest deadline and work on that. There is nothing like a deadline to focus the mind, and it is better to get the items that demand short term attention into the calendar and to allot the time to tackle them. Bernie Galler described this approach to me once, and it stuck. A second approach is to put everything you might ever want to do in a big pile and pick something at random from it to work on. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-27-do-next/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Getting things done includes deciding what not to do. In my case, it's a matter of going through my todo list and striking off the well-intentioned tasks from two or three months ago that took a moment to write and that would take hours to complete. I'm better off at accomplishing things when there are fewer undone things to choose from. Janet Choi writes about the done list for 99u.

        <p>I've been using a todo system based on Github issues for the better part of a year. It's been an interesting exercise in trying to corral the things that aren't done yet but that need to be. When I started out, I dumped every last thing that I might do into the system, everything from major tasks to "do laundry" (which can seem like a major task at times). The count of undone things oscillated from 60 to 100 things to be done, which made it seem like an infinite list because it took too long to review the whole list and it was on 3 or 4 screens. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-14-limiting-work-in-progress-vs-the-endless-todo-list/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm a big fan of finite lists of things to do. It's hard to keep up with things that require an answer, and sometimes you need to let things slide until the next day. When you combine those two, you get yesterbox. The basic idea is that you answer today's email tomorrow, so that you know when you get to the bottom of yesterday's mail you are really done. The slight complication for this system for me is that I'm also using a todo list which is supposed to capture everything I need to do. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-07-still-answering-yesterdays-email-also-doing-yesterdays-todos/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I use OneTab (see: previously) to manage the tabs on my Chrome browser. It does a great job of sweeping a bunch of current state for open tabs onto a page, so that you can get a fresh start when a new project comes up and then restore the state of the old one. It also means that I have a lot more working memory on my old MacBook. All in all a big win. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-12-mindfulness-about-what-youre-doing-with-onetab/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there's a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-many-publishable-words-can-you-write-in-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Yesterbox is a technique from Zappo&#39;s CEO Tony Hseih that redefines the task of email management. Rather than aim for an &quot;inbox zero&quot; for today&#39;s email (a never-ending task), he calls for answering today&#39;s mail tomorrow, and yesterday&#39;s mail today. Every message gets a one day delay unless it&#39;s so urgent that has to be dealt with right away. The biggest problem with &quot;inbox zero&quot; is that it&#39;s impossible to be caught up for any length of time, since you need to be always on the alert for new messages. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-27-yesterbox-answer-yesterdays-email-today/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m testing a new theory of work within a tabbed browser, using OneTab to help manage things. The thought is that at some times I&#39;ll be working and opening a lot of tabs to do that work, and that another time I&#39;ll be finishing up things and closing tabs down. The goal of a tab-closing session then is to type something meaningful into every open tab (or to pinboard that tab) and then close it out. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-25-open-every-tab-close-every-tab/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>There's nothing more frustrating to me than being almost but not quite on the Internet, as I discovered today when going to a cafe (unnamed, but linked) which advertised free wifi. My connections were slow and unreliable and frustrating to use. It looks like you're online but any applications that depend on always-on Internet for their well being work out badly. The best reaction that I have for this state of interrupted connectivity is to go offline and write in my little notebook. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-24-being-partially-online-is-worse-than-either-being-online-or-being-offline/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Yesterday was a day of careful attention to small details. I&#39;m particularly proud, in a peculiar way, of the effort that I made to unclog a slow drain in the bathtub. This particular drain has been draining slowly for months, and it&#39;s stumped me before. I&#39;ve tried boiling water, a plastic drain snake, baking soda and vinegar, and a plunger, and none of it worked.

        <p>Two weeks ago, I started using Github as an issue tracker to keep track of things that I intend to do. So far so good. According to its tally, I&#39;ve closed 139 issues and have 88 open issues. Here&#39;s some reflection on that use. I started up with Github in part because I have an infatuation with new technologies for self-organization, and this was the latest in a series of attempts to get my life in order. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-30-some-reflection-on-use-of-github-as-an-issue-tracker-two-weeks-in/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The phrase &quot;task surfing&quot; came to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out what it means. The searches I run for the phrase make it sound like other people think it&#39;s multitasking, but my experience is that I don&#39;t multitask. My screen generally has one window opened up full to whatever I&#39;m working on, and I try to keep extraneousl notifications and other distractions hidden away. So it&#39;s not that. What I think it might mean is working with my todo list - which is currently in a github issue tracker - and approaching it in an associative fashion rather than going strictly linearly through it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-20-task-surfing-which-is-to-say-not-multitasking-with-github/">&raquo;</a></p>
