      <description>I don&#39;t see an &#34;export all my work here&#34; button on ello, the new trendy social network. So I am unlikely to put anything there that I am unwilling to have destroyed on a moment&#39;s notice.</description>

      <description>&#34;The Power Of The Blog&#34;, Ann Arbor Observer, June 2013
 Vacuum&#39;s subject material is a hodgepodge, but that&#39;s because Vielmetti sees the blog very much in the classical context: as a personal, yet very public, journal. A longtime notebook keeper, Vielmetti sees Vacuum mostly as just another way to record and archive his own thoughts--although it recently hit a traffic milestone, with one million total page views.
 Patrick Dunn&#39;s story also has accounts from A2Gastroboy, Ben Connor Barrie of Damn Arbor, and Mark Maynard.</description>

      <title>Yahoo in talks to acquire Tumblr, users are not happy</title>

      <description>Yahoo is in talks to acquire Tumblr, with a price tag north of a billion dollars. Who knew that simplifying the blogging interface could be so profitable? I wonder, though, how Yahoo is going to make money off of Tumblr page views without ruining the service. (cf Flickr) (cf MyBlogLog) (cf GeoCities) etc. &amp;#0160;See what Tumblr users think of the acquisition.
 You know that house your friends got that was the best hang out, watch tv, party you face off, great pot lucks, still clean and comfy to chill in place?</description>

      <title>The import-export problem and fragile Internet services</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the scenario. You and your team work hard to use a new piece of collaboration software that offers some unique features that are suited either to the work at hand or that appeal to your sense of novelty. The tool works great and you get into it, using some of the more complex parts of the system to great advantage. Then the system&amp;rsquo;s owners send out the dreaded self-congratulatory message saying that they have been acquired by a big company, or some beleagured product manager announces that their system is being sunsetted.</description>

      <title>I&#39;ll miss Google Reader, but it&#39;s no longer how people read this site</title>

      <description>If my Google Analytics reporting is to be behaved, the peak of Google Reader usage for me was in mid 2008, and by early 2010 it had been reduced to background noise. I can understand based on this graph (and perhaps millions of other graphs like it) that it might be time to call it quits.
It looks like from other charts (that I won&amp;#39;t show here) that Twitter picked up the slack, as did Facebook.</description>

      <description>public notes from day 13 at AnnArbor.com.
I&amp;#39;m noting some MT setup details here, since I need a spot for it, and since I&amp;#39;ve been relatively spoiled by having the Typepad crew figure out how to make things just work.
1. &amp;#0160;&amp;quot;Replace Word Characters&amp;quot;. &amp;#0160;A default setting when you paste in Word documents is to have them paste in with entity characters; this setting converts those to ASCII. &amp;#0160;(Word, bleah, but it&amp;#39;s the norm.</description>

      <description>Trying to keep the chronology going - this is back to Monday of this week.
I had a nice and mostly non-confrontational interview with a journalist-with-a-capital-J about my new role at AnnArbor.com .&amp;#0160; The discussion seemed to center on what kinds of standards (or lack of standards) people have when they self-identify as bloggers, and how that compares with the ideal of what a professional journalist is supposed to be.</description>

      <title>Movable Type rich text editors and stripping weird tags</title>

      <description>Another part of day 3 -
We&amp;#39;re going through Movable Type training again today (thanks Natalie!)&amp;#0160; And the question came up, because it&amp;#39;s going to be part of the process, what are people going to do so that the workflow of someone pasting in what they write in some other text editor gets published in such a way that it doesn&amp;#39;t include weird tags, weird HTML, or funky or smelly javascript.</description>

      <description>day two of my new position at annarbor.com :
Full day of training on Movable Type.&amp;#0160; We started with a mostly empty install (hosted on a temporary EC2 instance; nice setup) and the team added users, made comments, posted entries and worked through the admin screens.&amp;#0160; I know that most people won&amp;#39;t be working at this level most of the time, but it&amp;#39;s also really good to give people some sense of what is possible with the tool and how the workflow and process starts to work.</description>
