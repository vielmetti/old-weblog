      <description>&lt;p&gt;U-Pick Strawberry season in the Ann Arbor area is over; it ended June 29 at Rowe&amp;#39;s, and June 26 at Whittaker&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juneberries are still on the trees, but they are overripe and best left for the birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulberries are out in full force on the trees and on the sidewalks. Look down for black blotches, then look up for ripe berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackberries and black raspberries can be found in parks or in the yards of helpful neighbors.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wasemfruitfarm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Wasem&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; has&amp;#0160;U-pick&amp;#0160;red and green gooseberries, red and black currants, and tart (sour) cherries, starting July 7. Not everything is always available depending on ripening, call ahead for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dexterblueberry.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Dexter Blueberry Farm&lt;/a&gt; is expecting to open July 20, according to their email; the web site says July 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realtimefarms.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Real Time Farms&lt;/a&gt; for more details on local produce. If you have any spare berries, let me know.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the search logs, it&#39;s season for both. Here&#39;s a bunch of recipes that use both. The common third ingredient is citrus, either lime or lemon, either in the recipe or served as the with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://agoodappetite.blogspot.com/2008/06/lemon-cupcakes-with-blueberry-basil.html&#34;&gt;Lemon cupcakes with blueberry basil filling&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;from the blog A Good Appetite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blueberry Basil Sauce

1/3 cup frozen or fresh blueberries
1 T water
1/2 t lemon juice
1 1/2 T granulated sugar
6 large basil leaves, chopped
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofdrink.com/2006/08/blueberry-basil-and-rum-cocktail.php&#34;&gt;Blueberry, basil and rum cocktail&lt;/a&gt;, Art of Drink:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Muddle basil, mint, sugar and lime juice in base of a shaker glass. Add blueberries and continue to muddle. Add rum and ice and shake. Fill collins glass with ice and strain muddled rum mixture into the glass and top with club soda. Garnish with a lime.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.washingtonpost.com/recipes/2009/05/14/blueberry-basil-ice-cream/&#34;&gt;Blueberry basil ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, Washington Post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Combine the blueberries, basil leaves and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the berries collapse and yield their juices. Transfer to a blender and let it cool there for 30 minutes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Place 2 cups blueberries in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped, about five times. Transfer to a medium bowl, and add onion, jalapenos, lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; stir to combine. Add basil, cilantro, remaining cup blueberries, and oil; stir to combine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this collection, you should be able to create many more variations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Capital Press is an agricultural journal for the Western US.&amp;#0160; I search it from time to time to get blueberry crop information.&amp;#0160; Here&amp;#39;s a latest &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.capitalpress.com/main.asp?SectionID=67&amp;amp;SubSectionID=619&amp;amp;ArticleID=51520&amp;amp;TM=84492.1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oregon blueberry assessment cap altered downward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:mlies@capitalpress.com&#34;&gt;&lt;span color=&#34;#000000&#34; size=&#34;1;&#34; style=&#34;font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitch Lies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span color=&#34;#000000&#34; size=&#34;1;&#34; style=&#34;font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font color=&#34;#000000&#34; face=&#34;ARIAL, SANS SERIF&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;SALEM
- Faced with downward pressure on price from increased blueberry
acreage, the Oregon Blueberry Commission has opted to lower the cap on
blueberry assessments.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span color=&#34;#000000&#34; size=&#34;2;&#34; style=&#34;font-family: ARIAL, SANS SERIF&#34;&gt;Oregon blueberry growers, beginning this summer, will pay no more than 1 percent of the value of their crop in assessments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oregonblueberry.com/farms.html&#34;&gt;A list of Oregon blueberry farms&lt;/a&gt; is useful if you are in the area during the fresh berry season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/04/south_american_bumper_crop_of.html&#34;&gt;An April 2009 story from the Grand Rapids Press&lt;/a&gt; points to a continuing growth in frozen blueberries in storage, in part due to growth of crops in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;About 150 million tons of blueberries are now in storage nationwide,
said Carlos Garcia Salazar, a small fruit specialist for &lt;a href=&#34;http://web1.msue.msu.edu/fruit/bluberry.htm&#34;&gt;Michigan State
Extension Service&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Ottawa County office. That&amp;#39;s about double the
normal amount for this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Fresh blueberry prices were above $2 per pound in
2007 and 2008, but this year they will be closer to $1.30 a pound. A
pound of processed blueberries could drop from $1.63 to below $1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;We had bonanza for three or four years,&amp;quot; Salazar said. &amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;We believe that given our holdings and storage some are estimating prices similar to five or six years ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible direction for this surplus of blueberries is increased use as a dried fruit, in addition to fresh and frozen.&amp;#0160; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2009/05/graceland_fruit_is_a_dried_and.html&#34;&gt;The Kalamazoo Gazette writes about Graceland Fruit&lt;/a&gt;, which has innovated in creating cherry and blueberry &amp;quot;raisins&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re starting to see a very significant increase in dried
blueberries,&amp;quot; said Frank Bragg, chief executive of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueberries.com/&#34;&gt;MBG Marketing&lt;/a&gt;, a
multi-state blueberry cooperative based in Grand Junction, near South
Haven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Today, 10 to 15 percent of processed blueberries are dried. That&amp;#39;s up from about 5 percent two years ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;A quarter of North America&amp;#39;s blueberry crop comes from a four-county
stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline between Grand Haven and the Indiana
border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, we had blueberry pancakes for breakfast (yum).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just going to keep posting about blueberries until I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s going to be summer again; I think we have a few tubs still in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search is for a blueberry muffin recipe with cardamom, and here&amp;#39;s some sample of same, to see what the variety is in the recipes so that perhaps some meta-recipe will emerge.&amp;#0160; Do be sure to read the first one through; it&amp;#39;s a moving memorial and a story of how we celebrate the end of someone&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href=&#34;http://cardamomaddict.blogspot.com/2006/10/ednas-favourite-blueberry-muffins.html&#34;&gt;Confessions of a Cardamom Addict: 
     Edna&amp;#39;s favourite blueberry muffins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;After the speeches and video clips we
spilled into the reception, its tables laidened with sandwiches and
sweets. Bowls of punch were off to the side as were carafes of coffee
and tea. But everywhere--and I do mean everywhere- were wicker baskets
filled with blueberry muffins. The Laurier catering team was given
Edna&amp;#39;s favourite muffin recipe (she was known for feeding muffins to
visitors) and they made hundreds of them. The recipe was also given to
each of us, along with a copy of her favourite poem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her own words &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve eaten a lot of blueberry muffins in my day, but none as good as my sister Norma&amp;#39;s.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edna&amp;#39;s Favourite Blueberry Muffins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;50g soft butter (1/4 c)&lt;br /&gt;125g sugar (3/4 c)&lt;br /&gt;1 egg, well beaten&lt;br /&gt;160g pastry flour (1-1/2c)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;1 dspn baking powder (2 tsp)&lt;br /&gt;150g blueberries (fresh or frozen) (1 c)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Preheat oven to 375F/190C and line or butter 12 medium muffin cups/9 large muffin cups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Sift together flour, salt and baking powder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Cream together butter and sugar. Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with milk. Fold in blueberries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: arial;&#34;&gt;Fill the tins (at least 2/3 full). Bake for 15-20 minutes or until done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://foodaccordingtome.com/2008/unrivaled-blueberry-muffins/&#34;&gt;food.&amp;#0160; according to me.&amp;#0160; [Unrivaled] Blueberry Muffins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(this one doesn&amp;#39;t have cardamom in it, but I will quote the preface to the recipe; you can link to the actual recipe)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://foodaccordingtome.com/picture_library/ATK_blues.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;lightbox&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;alignleft &#34; src=&#34;http://foodaccordingtome.com/picture_library/ATK_blues.jpg&#34; title=&#34;ATK Best Blueberry Muffins.&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After posting &lt;a href=&#34;http://foodaccordingtome.com/2008/champion-blueberry-muffins/#post-428&#34;&gt;Champion Blueberry Muffins&lt;/a&gt;,
more people have come to this site looking for from-scratch blueberry
muffins than, as far as I can tell by the search terms that lead people
here, anything else. I&amp;#39;ve been feeling sort of guilty: that post was
such a tease. Unfortunately, blueberries are definitely out of season
during these dark days; but maybe you stashed some in your refrigerator
last August...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=337987&#34;&gt;a recipe from amyburns1999 on SparkPeople for Blueberry Cardamom Muffins&lt;/a&gt;; it&amp;#39;s vegan, should that be relevant to you.&amp;#0160; (personally, skip the splenda, but that&amp;#39;s me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;These are so delicious you should make a double batch so you can freeze
some for later or share with friends. I normally substitute the sugar
with splenda for less calories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;gray12&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;45 Minutes to Prepare and Cook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
        
    

     
     &lt;h2 style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
     
     &lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     
     
&lt;div id=&#34;ingredients&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;table border=&#34;0&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&#34;top&#34;&gt;
1 cup almonds&lt;br /&gt;2 cups frozend blueberries&lt;br /&gt;2 cups flour&lt;br /&gt;1 cup sugar/splenda&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp cardamom&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp baking powder&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;br /&gt;1 cup vanilla soy milk lite&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;surprisingly - there were not a lot of these recipes that were easy to find on the first go-around; that might have been just because the general rule is &amp;quot;optional: add some other spice to taste&amp;quot;.&amp;#0160; will report back after I experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blueberries&lt;/em&gt;--now for some good news. Blueberry prices hit rock bottom this weekend. I can&amp;#39;t imagine they could get this cheap in the winter. Prices could be as low as $15 per case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be following the twitter stream of &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/eurofruit&#34;&gt;EuroFruit&lt;/a&gt; to get more details as well; country of origin might be Chile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote precis&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;The Chilean Fresh Fruit Association is to expand its blueberry marketing campaign to Germany, Austria and Italy for the first time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;For the third year running, the Chilean Fresh Fruit Association is set to promote its fresh blueberries during January and February in the UK, focusing on increasing market penetration and providing support for British blueberry retailers and importers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;Prices for one of Ehlers other crops, blueberries, was headed in the other direction. The blueberry has been gaining in popularity, and farmers all over the world have been planting more of the crop. The price for blueberries was around $1.50 a couple of years ago, falling to about 75 cents this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;There was a bit of a blueberry rush, so there is much more supply now,&amp;quot; Ehlers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(presumably that&amp;#39;s a wholesale price)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buy Michigan blueberries - retail, wholesale, photography and u-pick</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-24-buy-michigan-bl/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2008 01:40:29 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s blueberry season, and so one of the things you want to do is buy some berries.  Here&#39;s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For stock photography, Featurepix has a photo of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.featurepics.com/online/Fresh-Michigan-Blueberries-Bush-Photo423346.aspx&#34;&gt;fresh Michigan blueberries on a bush&lt;/a&gt;; the original photo is $4.  Another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/food-and-drink/fruits-and-vegetables/6135647-wild-blueberries.php?id=6135647&#34;&gt;wild blueberries on the bush photo from istockphoto&lt;/a&gt; is 10 credits (quatloos?  rubles? I don&#39;t know the exchange rate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At retail, Busch&#39;s in Ann Arbor is currently selling them for $14.99 for a 5 pound box, or $1.99 per pint (on sale from $2.99/pint).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.therussellcorp.com/berries/#Hours%20of%20Operation%20/%20Season&#34;&gt;Russell&#39;s Blueberry Farm&lt;/a&gt; in Freeland, MI (near Saginaw) has posted 2007 prices of $2.10/lb wholesale, and $1.45/lb u-pick.  Call for 2008 pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.merchantcircle.com/business/Reenders.Blueberry.Farm.616-842-5238&#34;&gt;Reenders Blueberry Farm in Grand Haven&lt;/a&gt; has a page on Merchant Circle where potential customers are asking questions like &#34;We are interested in purchasing around 500 bluberry lugs, 36x16x7. If you sell these, we would like a quote. Thanks&#34;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reendersblueberryfarms.com/store.html&#34;&gt;web site for the Reenders Blueberry Farm&lt;/a&gt; lists 2008 prices, 10 pounds for $21.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueberrylanefarms.com/&#34;&gt;Blueberrry Lane Farms&lt;/a&gt; in Otter Lake, MI, northeast of Flint, MI has U-Pick $1.80/lb, and 10 lb pre-pick with box $35.00.  Place your pre-pick orders 1 week in advance.  The farm has been in blueberry production since 1949 and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?SEQ_NO_115=134437&#34;&gt;Elliott blueberry&lt;/a&gt; was developed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild berries in the UP should be good near the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/06/sleeper-lake-fi.html&#34;&gt;Sleeper Lake Fire&lt;/a&gt; area; stay near &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cabincam.net/tourism.html&#34;&gt;Paradise, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newberrychamber.net/&#34;&gt;Newberry, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pinestumpjunction.com/&#34;&gt;Pine Stump Junction, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natureskennel.com/links.htm&#34;&gt;McMillan, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; (home of the Generic Motel, &#34;clean, cheap&#34;).  Call ahead for when the berries are ripe and check before going onto private property.  Bridge toll on the Mackinac Bridge, $3.00.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wild Michigan Blueberries - a photo album (w/many comments)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Webshots contributor &#34;candistackable&#34; has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://travel.webshots.com/album/171362932DUOqVQ&#34;&gt;photo album of Michigan wild blueberry picking&lt;/a&gt; from 2004.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In our part of Michigan (Topinabee) the woods are thick with wild blueberries toward the end of July and the beginning of August. I hope you enjoy my images.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s lots of pictures, and lots of comments on the pictures, including this one from &#34;jrgoflo&#34;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I loved these pictures. There&#39;s really nothing better than Wild Michigan blueberries. My favorite place to pick them is at the Shelldrake Dam State Forest Campground NW of Paradise in the U.P. or the Betsy Lake area of Tahquamenon Falls State Park. I&#39;ve just planted 10 lowbush blueberry shrubs at my house. Can&#39;t wait!!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve asked for permission to reuse a photo (and will add one here if I get that).  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buddhist blueberries in Vancouver, BC: &#34;Plenty&#34;</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-buddhist-bluebe/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2008 15:10:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crosscut.com/lifestyle-leisure/16081/&#34;&gt;Geri Larkin writes in Crosscut Seattle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.librarything.com/work/2908575&#34;&gt;Plenty&lt;/a&gt; is about a young Vancouver couple, Alisa Smith and J.B. Mackinnon. The two decide to live on locally grown foods for a year. I&#39;ve just read to the section on blueberries where they find a patch of beautiful, fat juicy ones only to discover that they are being grown for a local Buddhist temple and are not for sale. I don&#39;t know, yet, if they talk their way into a sale. Given how personable the couple is, my guess is probably. Putting the book down to attend to chores, I&#39;ve realized that Smith and Mackinnon have convinced me to seriously consider following their eat-local example.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll note that the LibraryThing tag cloud for this book includes the tag &#34;read and returned&#34; (!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a recipe from that article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Buddha&#39;s Blueberry Bread Pudding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 cups of just about any kind (maybe not dark rye) of bread chunks, an inch or two in size, mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter or canola oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2-3 cups of blueberries (You can decide how much you can bear to cook as opposed to eat raw.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 eggs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 tsp. of ground cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 1/2 cups of almost hot water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk (The condensed part matters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/4 cup of melted butter or oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 teaspoons of vanilla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the bread chunks into a greased, 9-inch baking pan. Square works best, but whatever you have will probably work. Sometimes I use two bread baking pans. Sprinkle the berries over the bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a big bowl, stir up the eggs, then add all the other remaining ingredients. Stir for a minute or two and then pour the mixture over the bread and blueberries. Bake about 45 minutes or until a knife stuck into the center comes out clean or mostly clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to eat the pudding straight out of the oven because it will burn the top of your mouth. If you do anyway, your mouth will feel much better by tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Geri Larkin is a former Ann Arborite now in Seattle; she has several books out that I didn&#39;t know about, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.librarything.com/work/1905484&#34;&gt;The Chocolate Cake Sutra: Ingredients for a Sweet Life (Hardcover)&lt;/a&gt;, ISBN 0060836954.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BLUEBERRY SUMMERS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By John Clark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raked blueberries for several years, never getting particularly skillful at it, but earning enough to buy my school clothes and supplies every fall. Along the way, I discovered the itchy and painful bite of brown field spiders and that not all hornets nest in trees. I even watched, bemused as a dozen teenagers ran whooping and hollering after a curious bear that had followed our truck down a woods road from a remote blueberry field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;read the whole thing at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wolfmoonpress.com/Essays/blueburrysummers.htm&#34;&gt;Wolf Moon Journal&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>mechanical blueberry harvesters</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-24-mechanical-blue/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2008 00:37:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-24-mechanical-blue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re serious about harvesting blueberries (as opposed to just picking them), you mechanize the operation.  Here&#39;s an example of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dbe.ca/blueberryharvester.htm&#34;&gt;blueberry harvester from Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Doug Bragg Enterprises Ltd. Mechanical Blueberry Harvester consists of a reel-type picking head. The head is side mounted to a tractor in such a manner as to allow the picking head to follow contours of the ground. The reel rotates within the head in the same direction as the tractor wheels. This rotation is at a speed in ratio to the forward motion of the tractor. As the comb type-picking bars rake the blueberries from the plants they are carried around the reel and deposited in a conveyor. This conveyor delivers them to another longer conveyor, which carries them to the rear three-point-hitch mounted loading platform. As the berries fall from the conveyor a blower cleans them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harvester was invented by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nsac.ns.ca/halloffame/citations/bragg_douglas.htm&#34;&gt;R. Douglas Bragg&lt;/a&gt; (1930-1996):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Doug Bragg always maintained a strong interest in the blueberry industry. Not only was he a manufacturer of the patented wild blueberry harvester and a blueberry producer himself, but he was an active member of the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia. From 1979 to 1981 he served as a Director and was an active member of the Research Committee from the time of its inception until the fall of 1996. He was a Founding Director of the Nova Scotia Blueberry Institute and was instrumental in the early days of its development and building of the research field station at Debert. In 1995 Doug received the Wild Blueberry Producers Association of Nova Scotia Award of Recognition.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a set of patents on blueberry harvesters.  Here&#39;s what US Patent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5375403/description.html&#34;&gt;5365403, Lowbush berry harvester&lt;/a&gt; has to say about the Bragg patented harvester:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A later development is reported in Canadian Pat. No. 1,249,727 of Bragg Lumber Company. According to the patent, this harvester mounts a picking head, almost identical to the Chisholm-Ryder head, on the side of a farm tractor, but in such a manner that the picking head is &#34;towed &#34; by the tractor. The arrangement ostensibly accommodates variations in the ground by allowing for pitch and roll of the head during operation. As with the Chisholm-Ryder head, the tines of the Bragg harvester are controlled by a cam and cam follower arrangement. In the Bragg harvester, as the tines approach top dead centre of the reel they are caused to flap rapidly to dislodge the berries carried thereby for easy deposit on the internal conveyor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my favorite blueberry-picking grounds, there&#39;s way too many ferns, jack pines, jack pine cones, bits of lichen and moss to ever make it suited for mechanical harvesting; just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I come across some topic related to both blueberries and the title of this blog (vacuum), I am compelled to post it.  In this case, we have &#34;vacuum microwave drying&#34; or VMD, a food preservation technique using a vacuum chamber and a microwave energy source instead of a typical hot air or freeze drying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.engineer.msu.ac.th/CD_Conference/conference/CD-Conferance/IDS2000/home/pdf/318.pdf&#34;&gt;QUALITY OF THE VACUUM MICROWAVE DRIED BLUEBERRIES IN TERMS &lt;br /&gt;
OF COLOR, COMPOSITION, AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY &lt;br /&gt;

Vacuum microwave drying has great potential to produce high quality food products with greater retention of heat and oxygen sensitive bioactive components. Blueberries have recently been noted for their high antioxidant activity.  The components that are likely to be responsible for this activity are the phenolic compounds and vitamin C content.  This study compared the effects of vacuum microwave, air, freeze, and a combination of air/vacuum microwave drying on vitamin C, anthocyanin, phenolic, and antioxidant activity of two blueberry cultivars.  In addition the color characteristics of the berries were assessed. Vacuum microwave dried berries retained higher amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanin, and phenolics than air-dried berries. All blueberry extracts exhibited antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to anthocyanin, total phenolic and vitamin C content. There was no significant difference between the antioxidant activities of vacuum microwave dried and freeze-dried blueberries.
