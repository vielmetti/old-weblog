Juneberries are still on the trees, but they are overripe and best left for the birds.
Mulberries are out in full force on the trees and on the sidewalks. Look down for black blotches, then look up for ripe berries.

This from the Capital Press: Blueberry stocks in cold storage outpace past years; Berry dealers see bright side in large stocks of fruit
Frozen blueberries are selling at a steady clip, but carryover stocks from 2008&rsquo;s crop are still huge, according to industry experts.
Sales seem to have picked up speed late last year, with warehouse stocks falling by 4 percent in October, 6 percent in November and 7 percent in December 2008, according to the USDA&rsquo;s National Agricultural Statistics Service. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-26-frozen-blueberry-price-report-eastern-washinton-blueberry-workshop-march-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Webshots contributor "candistackable" has a photo album of Michigan wild blueberry picking from 2004.  In our part of Michigan (Topinabee) the woods are thick with wild blueberries toward the end of July and the beginning of August. I hope you enjoy my images.  There's lots of pictures, and lots of comments on the pictures, including this one from "jrgoflo":
 I loved these pictures. There's really nothing better than Wild Michigan blueberries. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-wild-michigan-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Geri Larkin writes in Crosscut Seattle:
 The book Plenty is about a young Vancouver couple, Alisa Smith and J.B. Mackinnon. The two decide to live on locally grown foods for a year. I've just read to the section on blueberries where they find a patch of beautiful, fat juicy ones only to discover that they are being grown for a local Buddhist temple and are not for sale. I don't know, yet, if they talk their way into a sale. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-buddhist-bluebe/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>BLUEBERRY SUMMERS
By John Clark
My wife Beth waited while I looked around the new room, hunting for the Shedd’s peanut butter pail. The room and the pail are both nearly fifty years old, but names, like memories don’t fade easily. When we reached the blueberry field, I paused. “Expect to see a deer.” After dropping the first few berries from a height sufficient to create the time-honored “Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk,” we smiled at each other, sharing separate, but still entwined memories of Robert McCloskey’s Blueberries For Sal. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-23-blueberry-summe/">&raquo;</a></p>
