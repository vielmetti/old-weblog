      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you become an expert in a field?  By writing about that
field, repeatedly, until you have mastered it to the level which
people find you easily and draw on your expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big part of being able to write about something twice a day is
to have a ready collection of other people to call on for ideas or
to ask for details or referrals.   By being ready to tap into other
people&amp;rsquo;s expertise, you figure out what you need to know fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/12/bird_by_bird_an.html&#34;&gt;Anne Lamott&amp;rsquo;s Bird by Bird&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are an enormous number of people out there with invaluable
information to share with you, and all you have to do is pick up
the phone.  They love it when you do, just as you love it when
people ask if they can pick your brain about something you happen
to know a great deal about &amp;ndash; or, as in my case, have a number of
impassioned opinions on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/expert/&#34;&gt;blogger&amp;rsquo;s secret&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; series.&lt;/p&gt;
