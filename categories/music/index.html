        <p>It&rsquo;s a warm but pleasant mid-summer late Monday morning, and I&rsquo;m visiting the first cafe inbound on a walk to town. Biggby Packard is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so. Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&rsquo;s not really enough here to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus. I&rsquo;ve been in here before when I was the only patron for more than an hour but this morning there&rsquo;s a few more people sitting typing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-20-daily-coffee-wifi-packard-biggby/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable. The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&#39;t remember it either). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-07-08-new-to-me-at-least-for-80s-music-on-the-radio-play-30-year-old-casey-kasem-top-40-countdown-shows-exactly-as-originally-b/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning that Jim Tressel has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&#39;s leadership of the program, culminating in an NCAA investigation. For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the Dead Schembechlers. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&#39;s best to have a &quot;holy rivalry&quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &quot;New Wolverine Order&quot;, the &quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&quot;, or the &quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-30-tressel-dead-schembechlers/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Gil Scott-Heron (b. April 1, 1949; d. May 27, 2011) was a poet and musician. Obituaries: NPR, by Daoud Tyler-Ameen; Wikipedia; Associated Press / New York Times. Los Angeles Times written by Randall Roberts for the blog Pop and Hiss: Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson. Written after Scott-Heron had recorded "I'm New Here" but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-27-obituary-gil-scott-heron-1948-2011-american-musician-and-poet/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The video, entitled "It is pitch dark", from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot. The lyrics, in part: You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue? The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-01-21-you-are-likely-to-be-eaten-by-a-grue/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Link to Cindy Kallet and Grey Larson on NPR (no way to embed, sadly). It's a 6 minute segment. Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. &ldquo;It has the string sound of a viola,&rdquo; Kallet says, &ldquo;and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it&rsquo;s small enough that I can handle it easily.&rdquo; Many of the pieces on the record possess elements of Scandinavian melody and harmony, yet remain Balkan in rhythm. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-08-03-cindy-kallet-an/">&raquo;</a></p>
