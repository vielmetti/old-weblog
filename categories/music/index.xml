      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a warm but pleasant mid-summer late Monday morning, and I&amp;rsquo;m visiting the first cafe inbound on a walk to town. Biggby Packard is where I end up when the inbound bus schedule timing is just so.
Summertime cafes near campus are odd. There&amp;rsquo;s not really enough here to motivate someone to drive here for coffee, so it draws people from the surrounding neighborhood and from the athletic campus. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in here before when I was the only patron for more than an hour but this morning there&amp;rsquo;s a few more people sitting typing.</description>

      <description>Enjoyed this video (featuring great video game graphics/sounds) from Papillon.

Get the whole album, Calligraphy, at Bandcamp.
 Papillon (a.k.a. the PeanutButterFly) is a Caribbean American poet and song-writer from Paris, France. Raised with a very culturally diverse environment and brought up in a world of entertainment, this multi-media artist has been an actor and musician since the early age of 12. After a first solo album called “the Amber Dawn” he is returning to the stage with the double album “Calligraphy”.</description>

      <description>My friend Papillon is working on a double album &#34;Calligraphy&#34; which he&#39;s producing with the help of an Indiegogo campaign. Of this he says
 Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet. This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.
The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters.</description>

      <description>The Detroit Sound Conservancy has a Kickstarter project going to raise $5,000 towards preserving the history of Detroit music through a series of oral history interviews of Detroit area music critics and journalists.
 There is no public oral history archive dedicated to Detroit music. We are going to build one. You can help. We are going to start with the &amp;quot;first responders&amp;quot; to the Detroit sound: Detroit music journalists. Detroit music journalists have been key archivists of Detroit sounds that have changed the world, from Motown to techno, blues to jazz, to so much more.</description>

      <description>Via Viral Viral Videos:
 Long Island hit music station 106.1 BLI ... made this genius Long Island Power Authority spoof of the KPop mega hit with their own relevant lyrics, all pertaining to the recent mass power outages due to hurricane Sandy. Naturally, the music video is instantly going viral!
&amp;#0160;
  Add this to your list of parodies of this hit - my other favorite is &amp;quot;Klingon Style&amp;quot;, and my younger son was singing along to &amp;quot;Mitt Romney Style&amp;quot; the other day.</description>

      <description>New, to me at least, for 80s music on the radio: play 30 year old Casey Kasem Top 40 countdown shows, exactly as originally broadcast. Prefab nostalgia, plus all of those songs that never had enough staying power to be otherwise memorable.
The particular set that I listened to was on Lite 96 (from Petoskey, MI), WXLT 96.3 on your dial. It should be possible to radio-carbon date the original show down to the exact week, based on what was being played - I heard Huey Lewis and the News, a cut from Chicago 16, and a Blondie cut that probably hadn&amp;#39;t been on the air since 1982 (Island of Lost Souls; no, I don&amp;#39;t remember it either).</description>

      <description>There&amp;#39;s a great song by The Horse Flies, called &amp;quot;Roadkill&amp;quot;, with the memorable line &amp;quot;eat what you kill&amp;quot;. This is from their live show at the Grassroots Festival, 1993:

You&amp;#39;ll find more Horseflies tunes on the Internet Archive from their live shows. Look for their other seasonally appropriate tune &amp;quot;I live where it&amp;#39;s gray&amp;quot;. I haven&amp;#39;t yet heard their latest album Until The Ocean. (Amazon link).</description>

      <description>The Columbus Dispatch broke the news this morning that Jim Tressel has resigned as head football coach at Ohio State University. A Sports Illustrated cover story details troubles with Tressel&amp;#39;s leadership of the program, culminating in an NCAA investigation.
For balanced reporting from Columbus about the football program I always turn to Bo Biafra, front man for the Columbus based punk band the Dead Schembechlers. Biafra knows the story with the Wolverines; it&amp;#39;s best to have a &amp;quot;holy rivalry&amp;quot; with Michigan, and thus every problem in Columbus with the program gets blamed on the &amp;quot;New Wolverine Order&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;International Wolverine Conspiracy&amp;quot;, or the &amp;quot;Mainstream Michigan Media&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Gil Scott-Heron (b. April 1, 1949; d. May 27, 2011) was a poet and musician.
 Obituaries: NPR, by Daoud Tyler-Ameen; Wikipedia; Associated Press / New York Times.
Los Angeles Times written by Randall Roberts for the blog Pop and Hiss:  Last year the New Yorker published a reverent but heartbreaking profile of Scott-Heron by Alec Wilkinson. Written after Scott-Heron had recorded &#34;I&#39;m New Here&#34; but after he had relapsed and was smoking crack openly in front of the reporter, the story traced his rise, his fall and his influence.</description>

      <description>The video, entitled &#34;It is pitch dark&#34;, from nerdcore hip-hop grandmaster MC Frontalot.

The lyrics, in part:
You are likely to be eaten by a grue. If this predicament seems particularly cruel, consider whose fault it could be: not a torch or a match in your inventory. What is a grue?
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light.</description>

Galveston had a seawall To keep the water down, But the high tide from the ocean Washed water over the town. Wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm! Oh, wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm with water!
Wasn&#39;t that a mighty storm That blew all the people away! Their trumpets gave them warning, &amp;quot;You&#39;d better leave this place.&amp;quot; They never thought of leaving Till death looked them in the face.</description>

The Reverse Engineers have a song &amp;quot;Mercury in Retrograde&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s a $0.99 download from Amazon.
The lyrics match the problem.

      <description>Link to Cindy Kallet and Grey Larson on NPR (no way to embed, sadly). It&#39;s a 6 minute segment.  Kallet is also known for playing what she calls the fiola: a hybrid fiddle that uses half- or three-quarters-sized viola strings. &amp;ldquo;It has the string sound of a viola,&amp;rdquo; Kallet says, &amp;ldquo;and it has the low string of the viola, which I really love. But it&amp;rsquo;s small enough that I can handle it easily.</description>
