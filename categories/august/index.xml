      <description>This coming week promises to be the last week of summer. Some surefire signs of the season.
Students are back in town. You see them on the streets, in the shops, and sometimes even on campus. They look younger every year, except for your own kids, who are getting old fast.
It&#39;s worthwhile to start getting your kids to bed early, because it might take a full week to get their sleep schedules changed to have them get up early enough to make it to school on time.</description>
