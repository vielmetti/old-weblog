      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #ffffbf;&#34;&gt;Knolling&lt;/span&gt; is the practice of organizing things neatly, especially to
arrange things in parallel lines or at right angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Jason Kottke&lt;/span&gt; for the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kottke.org/14/03/always-be-knolling&#34;&gt;always be knolling&lt;/a&gt; idea and
background info, which he attributes to
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Andrew Kromelow&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some inspriation see
&lt;a href=&#34;http://thingsorganizedneatly.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;Things Organized Neatly&lt;/a&gt;, a Tumblr from
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #bfffff;&#34;&gt;Austin Radcliffe&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Tom Sachs movie, &amp;ldquo;Always be knolling&amp;rdquo;, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://tenbullets.com/&#34;&gt;Ten Bullets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-CTkbHnpNQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously spotted in a similar way, the &amp;ldquo;5S&amp;rdquo; process of getting
rid of clutter, especially &amp;ldquo;seiton&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;neatness&amp;rdquo;. Everything goes
into its own place. Knolling is a bit more freeform and does away
with explicit labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does get me to thinking thought that I&amp;rsquo;m very tired of some of the
presentation of screens that I look at all the time. My Gmail inbox is
always a simple list; would it not be that hard some time to make it a
grid of squares with people&amp;rsquo;s photos in them, so that I could see at
a glance who was in my inbox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start to sort one thing, you want to sort everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>custom views of taxonomies</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-16-custom-views-of-taxonomies/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-16-custom-views-of-taxonomies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move
a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over
categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same;
the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that
look different. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should
be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of posts about books in the collection, which
should be connected to a lookup for that book in your favorite
bookstore or my favorite library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of people mentioned, and a people index would
be great so you can browse and not just search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly I&amp;rsquo;m after improving the browsing experience, as much for
me as for anyone else. If you have to find things with a search
engine, you are stuck in a world where you have to know that something
has a particular name. By offering a browsing infrastructure first,
you cherrypick the best search terms and put them up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this will need pen and paper design&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, and bots</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-29-hearts-spades-clubs-diamonds-and-bots/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pete Kaminski pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm&#34;&gt;this essay on archetypes in computer gaming&lt;/a&gt;, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. It is not enough to win friends by your personal charm in this world; instead you write the Bayesian classifier that guides your behavior scientifically towards friend maximization. Whatever can be automated will be automated, and the rest of human behavior analyzed to give clues for further automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of online games lend themselves to machines assisting or even taking over. People who have substantial bot writing skills have an undue influence on the culture of online networks and games for the few humans who stick around unarmed to watch the fray up close. What better way to while away the hours online than by tending to your collection of bots that prompt, provoke, or guide the behavior of other humans (or other bots).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-30-ive-redesigned-the-front-page-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 17:25:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-30-ive-redesigned-the-front-page-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I&#39;d give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see it at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com&#34;&gt;http://vielmetti.typepad.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good, I guess. I don&#39;t have strong preferences about it; the advantage is that more short posts fit on a page, making it easier to scroll through a lot of them. The disadvantage is that I don&#39;t know where the 40 word mark is, and there&#39;s no really obvious way to say &#34;always excerpt the lead paragraph&#34;, which is what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiddling with your blog is the traditional way not to write. If I had to fiddle more, I&#39;d look for a design that worked better on mobile devices like my Android phone; the current design has a weird choice of fonts for blog title that comes out too small, and my CSS-fu is not adequate to the task of debugging and fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yahoo makes changes to Flickr, users are not happy</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-21-yahoo-makes-changes-to-flickr-users-are-not-happy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The site loads slowly, the photos are all squished together, and the carefully curated metadata and tags and comments and photo names are de-emphasized. It&amp;#39;s like a weird mix of Pinterest and Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://classic.flickr.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;classic.flickr.com&lt;/a&gt; to preserve the old UI, in the same way that old-school Weather Underground users can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://classic.wunderground.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;classic.wunderground.com&lt;/a&gt; to see things the way they were meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the time, I&amp;#39;d cherry pick the best photos from my Flickr stream and blog about them here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Losing the categorical imperative</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-24-losing-the-categorical-imperative/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-24-losing-the-categorical-imperative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JNMK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00006JNMK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=superpatron-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; border=&#34;10px&#34; src=&#34;http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B00006JNMK&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=superpatron-20&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=superpatron-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00006JNMK&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&amp;rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them. A good, tidy, modern blog that is comprehensive in some narrow sphere would have a tidy list of categories and would post in each of them regularly enough to be helpful. In contrast, a laundry list of one-time enthusiams just makes it pointedly clear when my interests have waxed and waned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Typepad doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a straightforward way to &amp;ldquo;pin&amp;rdquo; a blog post to the top of a category, the same way that it can mark a post to stay on top of the main page. That makes it trickier to create permanent navigation within a category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope to put together some better navigation, so that someone coming to the blog for the first time can read some more popular posts or ones that I like. The whole thing has long since gone from a narrow, coherent narrative and turned into an unpolished open notebook, gathering scraps from here and there and not always pieces that have an obvious relation to the work as a whole. If it were a real scrapbook it would have tape-tags sticking out of it at all angles in all colors flagging things that deserve to be seen again; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be done with categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zoom! Speeding up the web, one page at a time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901b80b309970b-pi&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Zoom&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901b80b309970b&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01901b80b309970b-300wi&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; title=&#34;Zoom&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was reading this Medium post from &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/167ae2fae1fb&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Eric E Anderson on blog design and especially on sidebars&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to rework the design of this blog. No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&amp;#39;m working on upper right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&amp;#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little hurt by making the sidebars full of white space, but not much. My paper notebooks have lots of marginalia, but they are marginalia that change with every page, and a lot of it is sidebar note-to-self rather than publishable anything. Still, the pages load &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a lot faster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when they don&amp;#39;t have quite so much crap on them, and I haven&amp;#39;t even started to explore adding more stuff at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.typepad.com&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Typepad&lt;/a&gt; is particularly good as a place to play with designs, they have a lot of premade ones that look much better than anything I would cobble together on my own (see e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog-0001.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;this early effort&lt;/a&gt; which I wrote in vi, which is probably where I&amp;#39;d start from if left to my own devices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pages load a lot faster. Zoom! And that alone is worthwhile to do a redesign for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;The business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/26/newYorkTech.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The phrase is from Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&amp;#0160;&lt;a name=&#34;isNewYorkTechDifferentFromCaliforniaTechThereMightBeSomeSlightDifferencesButYouCouldTakeATechConferenceFromCaliforniaPlopItDownInNycAndNotOnlyWouldTheSameIdeasBeDiscussedFromTheSamePerspectiveButMostOfThePeopleWouldBeTheSameTheApisAreCorporateApisTheCmsesAreSilosTheBusinessModelIsHamstersGeneratingLessMoneyWithEachTurnOfTheWheel&#34;&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scripting.com/stories/2012/05/26/newYorkTech.html#isNewYorkTechDifferentFromCaliforniaTechThereMightBeSomeSlightDifferencesButYouCouldTakeATechConferenceFromCaliforniaPlopItDownInNycAndNotOnlyWouldTheSameIdeasBeDiscussedFromTheSamePerspectiveButMostOfThePeopleWouldBeTheSameTheApisAreCorporateApisTheCmsesAreSilosTheBusinessModelIsHamstersGeneratingLessMoneyWithEachTurnOfTheWheel&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;permalink&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;9&#34; src=&#34;http://scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif&#34; width=&#34;6&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. It makes me want to start something brand new of my own - but then - you end up being captured by all of the tools you have to learn to bring it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best thing to think through this is that all new shiny online services have a lifespan. Some of them grow quickly and then die (remember Pownce? I thought not), some of them grow slowly and still live on somehow (remember Plurk?), others never get off the ground (a dozen tiny spam-overrun Twitter clones), and a tiny handful make it to Twitter size. You generally don&amp;#39;t know when you&amp;#39;re starting to talk to people through some new online system whether you are going to treat it as a long-term commitment to learning a complex system, or just some hands-on experimentation in something to be ignored and forgotten in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you are a hamster, and you see a wheel. Do you get on to try it out, give yourself some exercise, or do you go to your workshop and build a better wheel?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New design</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2010 18:33:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &amp;#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to hit &amp;quot;shift-refresh&amp;quot; to force everything to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new. &amp;#0160;How few things work that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was especially nice that when I picked a photo to use for the theme, that the system suggested an appropriate accompanying color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also noted, 5/22/2010: as author, my top navigation bar has an &amp;quot;edit post&amp;quot; button, so I can change things well after the fact. &amp;#0160;This is promising. &amp;#0160;I do notice that there are no archives links anymore and no easy way for anyone to notice that I&amp;#39;ve been plugging away at this for years, but the &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; box is very welcomed, and should unearth some things that would have otherwise been buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/19/11: The design I had picked was &amp;quot;Chroma&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve swapped that out for &amp;quot;Journal Black&amp;quot;, which served to restore the category and archive links. --Ed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/24/13: Now using the &amp;quot;Clean&amp;quot; theme, with radically simplified sidebars.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;Networked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;buffering&lt;/span&gt;: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, &lt;strong&gt;James Whitacre&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Axel Bender&lt;/strong&gt;, 2009/12/10, &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1961&#34;&gt;arXiv:0912.1961&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents. Our principle claim is formulated within the so-called &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;networked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;il&#34;&gt;buffering&lt;/span&gt; hypothesis. It outlines how degenerate systems may readily produce a distributed response to local perturbations and reciprocally how excess resources related to a single function can indirectly support multiple unrelated functions within a degenerate system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translating a bit out of complex systems speak, here&amp;#39;s my interpretation.&amp;#0160; Note that the paper proposes a design principle (and not a rigorously tested set of experiments) so there&amp;#39;s room to explore this principle in a variety of worlds and words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first note is that the pieces of the robust complex system in question are &lt;strong&gt;flexible and reconfigurable&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;quot;versatile&amp;quot;).&amp;#0160; Every part has multiple uses; every person has multiple sets of skills; for every functional role, there&amp;#39;s more that one piece that can fit that functional role.&amp;#0160; The expectation is that for any gap that you find from the temporary dislocation of a portion of the system there would be some other resource available to fill it, and also that if you have a temporary need for increased resources in some role that there would be a variety of resources available to pull into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second note is the that the agents are &lt;strong&gt;diverse&lt;/strong&gt; (oddly, in this language, &amp;quot;degenerate&amp;quot;) in their skills.&amp;#0160; This implies most critically that if two agents could fill the same functional role, that there might always be a swap between them so that one of them could take it one while the other applied their exceptional talent to the need that was pressing.&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the two principles you see how a system might get a considerable amount of redundancy and of reconfigurability to address exceptional needs.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; For any individual task, there&amp;#39;s more than one set of agents to address that task.&amp;#0160; Any portion of the system that is redundant for any given task is also exceptionally qualified for some other task.&amp;#0160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to draw conclusions to modern management, to staffing and scheduling and vacation time, and to the risks to brittle organizations when budgets are cut.&amp;#0160; I haven&amp;#39;t even made sense yet of the &amp;quot;network buffering&amp;quot; piece.&amp;#0160; Too short a post for that, please do have at the paper and see how that makes sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Every day, computers are making people easier to use (In Formation)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-13-every-day-compu/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 23:50:53 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of my dot-com era relics is issue #2 of the short-lived magazine In Formation.  Here&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5DA1530F936A25750C0A96E958260&#34;&gt;what the New York Times said about it in 1998:&lt;/a&gt; - the hypertext annotations are mine.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
 It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7wYtt6NroQ&#34;&gt;Howard Beale&lt;/a&gt;, the mad anchor in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/&#34;&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; deciding he&amp;rsquo;s opposed to corporate news operations, but a group of Silicon Valley wonks has taken the daring step of going public with an equally heretical notion. The cyber-future can wait.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The medium is a new quarterly magazine &amp;ndash; a print magazine &amp;ndash; called In Formation. Pitched as a hype buster for these high-tech times, the premiere issue, just out, announces its intentions with the acutely paranoid tag line, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=Snf&amp;amp;q=%22every+day+computers+are+making+people+easier+to+use%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every day, computers are making people easier to use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Whether that spirit takes the form of an article on the draconian implications of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com&#34;&gt;nationwide student database&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=8211&#34;&gt;loss of privacy in a cashless society&lt;/a&gt;, the subtext remains the same: &amp;ldquo;Be afraid. Be very afraid.&amp;rdquo; Which is not to say the magazine is humorless. In a parody, &amp;ldquo;The Internet Watch,&amp;rdquo; the first issue cleverly skewers&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0596513747%26tag=superpatron-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0596513747%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the hagiographic new-media profile, tracking the rise of the edgy, youthful genius behind&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Swatch-Silvertone-Wayfarer-Chronograph-SVBK4001AG/dp/B000KIE0TY&#34;&gt; a portable Internet device that can, on command, tell you what time it is.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The magazine&amp;rsquo;s editors and contributors have worked at places like the @Home Network, Apple and Starwave, so they know the territory. In Formation&amp;rsquo;s editor and publisher, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/1/b46&#34;&gt;David Temkin&lt;/a&gt;, sees the magazine taking on digital fetishism in much the same way &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZf48ZE8Jc&#34;&gt;Spy magazine riffed on the go-go 80&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Spy was outsiders looking for an in,&amp;rdquo; he says, in a line that will probably be repeated often during the magazine&amp;rsquo;s formative months. &amp;ldquo;In Formation is insiders looking for an out.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Issue #2 is a keeper, with stories on &amp;ldquo;The Internet Wants To KIll Me&amp;rdquo;, the Million Manager March, and a photo essay on the strip malls of Silicon Valley.    Plus this ad, from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22california+print+association%22&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&#34;&gt;California Print Association&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: the Internet is a cold, impersonal, cheerless place.  No amount of technology will ever make it more human.  All those clicks and URLs are confusing and hard to remember.  And did you know that 60% of the people who use search engines never find what they want?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a medium that can really make an impression, why not rely on the one that was &amp;ldquo;sticky&amp;rdquo; long before stickiness was good?  With no arcane plug-ins and no long download times, print has warmth, life, and a physical presence that the Internet can&amp;rsquo;t beat.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;PRINT: It just smells better!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Party like it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.city-data.com/zips/94115.html&#34;&gt;94115&lt;/a&gt;, 1999.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>quantitative measures of usability (or, measuring measurability)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2007/2007-12-04-quantitative-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2007 11:16:55 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2007/2007-12-04-quantitative-me/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I did the Google search for &#34;quantitative measures of usability&#34;, to see if that line of thinking would get me something useful.  Here&#39;s some explorations around those search results, and some reflections on that line of reasoning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CHI: single usability metric&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is a site &#34;measuring usability&#34; which unsurprisingly ranked high on the list.  It introduces the novel concept of a &#34;single measure of usability&#34;, which looks like the sum of a bunch of individual metrics all mushed together into a single number.  (Sauro and Kindlund, CHI 2005).  It measures task completion times, task time, satisfaction and error counts, and is a formalized version of what looks like an original Excel spreadsheet.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From an electronic commerce point of view this is a promising number, but an expensive one to compute - from web server logs you can impute task completion and task times, and maybe get some sense for errors, but satisfaction is hard to grind out of a server log.   It comes from the CHI tradition of simple models of user behavior assessed from small data sets.  But it&#39;s a start.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Patents: quantitative measures of qualitative usability&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s a patent filing (Ed Chi, Christopher Olston) with this initial claim:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
A system for determining a quantitative measure of qualitative usability of related Web pages, comprising: stored Web pages that each include at least one hyperlink referencing and proximal cues relating to distal content included in another Web page; a stored information goal identifying a target Web page; an activation network, comprising a directed graph comprising nodes corresponding to the Web pages and arcs corresponding to the hyperlinks, wherein a weight is assigned to each arc to represent a probability of traversal of the corresponding hyperlink based on a relatedness of keywords in the information goal to the proximal cues included in the referenced Web page; and a simulator to evaluate a traversal through the activation network to the node corresponding to the target Web page as a quantitative measure of usability.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s more (of course, it&#39;s a patent, there&#39;s a lot more).  It appears to be a simulator-driven version of the same PageRank algorithms that Google started out with, except that rather than assuming a random walk through page space it takes into account what Google would call quality scores and what they call &#34;information scent&#34;.  Chi works at PARC, and this looks like an elaboration of their &lt;a href=&#34;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=937550&#34;&gt;ScentTrails&lt;/a&gt; paper (TOCHI 2003).  Note that it&#39;s not about task completion as above but more about findability within a search space, and as thus it describes a different problem than above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;More work
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more relevant work in this field, but given that the first words I used to look both unearthed CHI related papers, I&#39;m not sure I have the right language to express the thing I&#39;m really after.  so I&#39;ll stop...
&lt;/p&gt;
