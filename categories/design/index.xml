      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pete Kaminski pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm&#34;&gt;this essay on archetypes in computer gaming&lt;/a&gt;, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play. It is not enough to win friends by your personal charm in this world; instead you write the Bayesian classifier that guides your behavior scientifically towards friend maximization. Whatever can be automated will be automated, and the rest of human behavior analyzed to give clues for further automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of online games lend themselves to machines assisting or even taking over. People who have substantial bot writing skills have an undue influence on the culture of online networks and games for the few humans who stick around unarmed to watch the fray up close. What better way to while away the hours online than by tending to your collection of bots that prompt, provoke, or guide the behavior of other humans (or other bots).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I&#39;d give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see it at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com&#34;&gt;http://vielmetti.typepad.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good, I guess. I don&#39;t have strong preferences about it; the advantage is that more short posts fit on a page, making it easier to scroll through a lot of them. The disadvantage is that I don&#39;t know where the 40 word mark is, and there&#39;s no really obvious way to say &#34;always excerpt the lead paragraph&#34;, which is what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiddling with your blog is the traditional way not to write. If I had to fiddle more, I&#39;d look for a design that worked better on mobile devices like my Android phone; the current design has a weird choice of fonts for blog title that comes out too small, and my CSS-fu is not adequate to the task of debugging and fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>quantitative measures of usability (or, measuring measurability)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2007/2007-12-04-quantitative-me/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I did the Google search for &#34;quantitative measures of usability&#34;, to see if that line of thinking would get me something useful.  Here&#39;s some explorations around those search results, and some reflections on that line of reasoning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CHI: single usability metric&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is a site &#34;measuring usability&#34; which unsurprisingly ranked high on the list.  It introduces the novel concept of a &#34;single measure of usability&#34;, which looks like the sum of a bunch of individual metrics all mushed together into a single number.  (Sauro and Kindlund, CHI 2005).  It measures task completion times, task time, satisfaction and error counts, and is a formalized version of what looks like an original Excel spreadsheet.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From an electronic commerce point of view this is a promising number, but an expensive one to compute - from web server logs you can impute task completion and task times, and maybe get some sense for errors, but satisfaction is hard to grind out of a server log.   It comes from the CHI tradition of simple models of user behavior assessed from small data sets.  But it&#39;s a start.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Patents: quantitative measures of qualitative usability&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s a patent filing (Ed Chi, Christopher Olston) with this initial claim:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
A system for determining a quantitative measure of qualitative usability of related Web pages, comprising: stored Web pages that each include at least one hyperlink referencing and proximal cues relating to distal content included in another Web page; a stored information goal identifying a target Web page; an activation network, comprising a directed graph comprising nodes corresponding to the Web pages and arcs corresponding to the hyperlinks, wherein a weight is assigned to each arc to represent a probability of traversal of the corresponding hyperlink based on a relatedness of keywords in the information goal to the proximal cues included in the referenced Web page; and a simulator to evaluate a traversal through the activation network to the node corresponding to the target Web page as a quantitative measure of usability.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s more (of course, it&#39;s a patent, there&#39;s a lot more).  It appears to be a simulator-driven version of the same PageRank algorithms that Google started out with, except that rather than assuming a random walk through page space it takes into account what Google would call quality scores and what they call &#34;information scent&#34;.  Chi works at PARC, and this looks like an elaboration of their &lt;a href=&#34;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=937550&#34;&gt;ScentTrails&lt;/a&gt; paper (TOCHI 2003).  Note that it&#39;s not about task completion as above but more about findability within a search space, and as thus it describes a different problem than above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;More work
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more relevant work in this field, but given that the first words I used to look both unearthed CHI related papers, I&#39;m not sure I have the right language to express the thing I&#39;m really after.  so I&#39;ll stop...
&lt;/p&gt;
