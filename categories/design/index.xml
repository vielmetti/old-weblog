      <description>Knolling is the practice of organizing things neatly, especially to arrange things in parallel lines or at right angles.
Thanks to Jason Kottke for the always be knolling idea and background info, which he attributes to Andrew Kromelow.
For some inspriation see Things Organized Neatly, a Tumblr from Austin Radcliffe.

      <description>One of the motivation ideas behind going to the work to move a big weblog to a new platform is to get better control over categories. With Typepad, every category looks about the same; the idea now is with Hugo I can have separate categories that look different. For instance:
There are a number of recipes in the collection, which should be sorted alphabetically or by key ingredient, not chronologically.</description>

      <title>hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, and bots</title>

      <description>Pete Kaminski pointed me to this essay on archetypes in computer gaming, in which four types of play style are described. Hearts play for social interaction, spades play to explore, diamonds play to level up, and clubs play to create havoc. It is a nice description of state of the art online game play in the MUD and MOO era of online gaming.
What has changed a lot since those olden days is the emergence of a new class of player, one who builds and operates bots to amplify their own game play.</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again)</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve redesigned the front page (again) so that it displays 40 word excerpts from blog posts, rather than the full text of the post. A similar treatment is given to archive and category pages. The automated excerpting is a new feature of Typepad, and I figured I&#39;d give it a go, knowing that I could always bring back the original with a few clicks.

      <title>Yahoo makes changes to Flickr, users are not happy</title>

      <description>The site loads slowly, the photos are all squished together, and the carefully curated metadata and tags and comments and photo names are de-emphasized. It&amp;#39;s like a weird mix of Pinterest and Tumblr.
I&amp;#39;m hoping for a classic.flickr.com to preserve the old UI, in the same way that old-school Weather Underground users can use classic.wunderground.com to see things the way they were meant to be.
If I had the time, I&amp;#39;d cherry pick the best photos from my Flickr stream and blog about them here.</description>

      <title>Losing the categorical imperative</title>

      <description>For a long time - over 2000 posts - I have been putting blog entries into categories. The categories used to live in a long list on the right sidebar. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken them out of the sidebar, and now they&amp;rsquo;re much less visible in the user interface to the point of being invisible unless you happen to search for them.
I have touched enough categories to not be authoritative on any of them.</description>

      <title>Zoom! Speeding up the web, one page at a time</title>

      <description>I was reading this Medium post from Eric E Anderson on blog design and especially on sidebars, and decided to rework the design of this blog. No more interminable list of categories - instead, just one little picture of me upper left, and a link to the book I&amp;#39;m working on upper right.
The full article is worth reading; it suggests that the footer is unexplored territory for blogs, and that you&amp;#39;re better off with a single column with the relevant consequental contextual information at the bottom, not on the side.</description>

      <title>&#34;The business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#34;</title>

      <description>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:
 The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
 I can&amp;#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems.</description>

      <title>New design</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</guid>
      <description>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &amp;#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.
I had to hit &amp;quot;shift-refresh&amp;quot; to force everything to load.
There&amp;#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new.</description>

      <title>network buffering, a design for robustness</title>

      <description>Networked buffering: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems, James Whitacre and Axel Bender, 2009/12/10, arXiv:0912.1961
Excerpt: This paper proposes a generic design principle for generating robust traits in complex systems that requires two basic conditions to be satisfied: 1) agents are versatile enough to perform more than one single functional role within a system and 2) agents are degenerate, i.e. there exists a partial overlap in the functional capabilities of agents.</description>

      <description>Lou Rosenfeld has a new workshop about analytics for the search within sites - the sort of information that is quantitatively and qualitatively different from general search terms and behavior because it&amp;rsquo;s within a closed domain (e.g. an intranet) or because people who are looking for something have already found you.

      <description>One of my dot-com era relics is issue #2 of the short-lived magazine In Formation. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the New York Times said about it in 1998: - the hypertext annotations are mine.  It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Howard Beale, the mad anchor in Network,&amp;rdquo; deciding he&amp;rsquo;s opposed to corporate news operations, but a group of Silicon Valley wonks has taken the daring step of going public with an equally heretical notion.</description>

      <title>quantitative measures of usability (or, measuring measurability)</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2007/2007-12-04-quantitative-me/</link>

      <description>I did the Google search for &#34;quantitative measures of usability&#34;, to see if that line of thinking would get me something useful. Here&#39;s some explorations around those search results, and some reflections on that line of reasoning.  CHI: single usability metric  There is a site &#34;measuring usability&#34; which unsurprisingly ranked high on the list. It introduces the novel concept of a &#34;single measure of usability&#34;, which looks like the sum of a bunch of individual metrics all mushed together into a single number.</description>
