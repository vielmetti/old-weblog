      <description>If you&amp;#39;re hunting morels, you know that the first rule of putting dots on a map to say where you found them is to be imprecise. It&amp;#39;s OK to say which county you located the morels in, but don&amp;#39;t narrow it down any more than that. I happen to know that morels can be found in Marquette County, but even my mom won&amp;#39;t always provide an exact location.
With this mapping in mind, here&amp;#39;s a few sources for early morel sightings in Michigan.</description>

      <description>May is almost over, and as always there is more I wish I would have done than was actually done. Some notes on things not written, in the hopes next year will bring another May (chances are good) and that I&amp;#39;ll have some of these May stories written before then.
a2b3. I would have loved to have written meeting non-summaries for every lunch meeting, capturing at least who was there, what the question was, how long it took to introduce everyone, how many people where there, and who the new people were.</description>
