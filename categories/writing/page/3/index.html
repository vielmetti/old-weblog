        <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity. It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-22-on-the-virtue-of-cheap-paper/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net. Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in.&#0160; You are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat.&#0160; Each experience is essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less dingy, but it&#39;s all of a piece. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-pretending-to-be-on-an-airplane/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow. 1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy. 2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary.&#0160; In any case, write around the start of your post. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-15-blog-more-twitter-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Writing for the Internet is not the same as writing for print.&#0160; Here are ten rules of thumb that will help you shape your writing that&#39;s designed for the screen and to help you adapt and reform words that were first printed out in ways that make them easier to manage. The paragraph is the unit of composition.&#0160; Keep your paragraphs together, making it possible to have any one of them pulled out and quoted in some other part of the internet without losing too much in the process.&#0160; If your narrative has complicated paragraphs, be aware that someone might pull out only a sentence from it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-04-21-how-to-write-for-the-web-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This blog serves a couple of functions, not all of which are sensibly part of the same easy to define train of thought. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;note to self&rdquo;, or &ldquo;note to future self&rdquo;, for the sorts of things that I want to publicly remember so that I can find them again. It&rsquo;s notes about places I&rsquo;d aspire to be and events I&rsquo;d like to go to. And some of it is research in progress, in which I get interested enough in something to write down what I find out about it and then wait for searchers to come up with good questions that find it (and more) so I can learn more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-05-note-to-self-on-organizing-communicating-and-noting-for-the-future/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>&quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&quot; (Jack Shedd) Jack has more in a rant that&#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &quot;cheese food manufacturing&quot; that Merlin Mann observes as dominating the world of &quot;pro bloggers&quot;. In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &quot;pick any two&quot; is the easiest answer. It&#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system.&#0160;Writing well and with passion and not often gives you an occasional lovely essay but not enough page views to get ads worth anything. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

More or less. threequel (33,900): When I was a kid, I assumed all third installments in a horror series had to capitalize on the ability to turn the “3″ in the title into “3-D.” Now, looking back, I only really remember (and can only find proof of) Jaws 3-D, Friday the 13th 3-D and Amityville 3-D. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-19-threequel-three/">&raquo;</a></p>
