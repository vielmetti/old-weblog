        <p>In sitting down to write this, my goal is to write exactly one thousand words. I exhort you to sit down and write long about something you are interested in rather than always confining your writing to the 140 character space that dominates contemporary social networks. Keep at it until you have reached some sizable target word count, and then trim it to size. It&#39;s ok to repeat yourself along the way. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-22-my-goal-sitting-down-to-write-this-is-to-write-a-thousand-words-exhorting-you-to-occasionally-sit-down-and-write-long-about/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I connected my Twitter feed to my Facebook feed; now I need to learn to write for both at once. Hard to do. Is there a way to be selective? One suggestion, from long-time blogger Prentiss Riddle, is to write things first in your weblog and then syndicate them out to wherever you want them to go. This is said to behave well with systems like Facebook that reward outbound clicks. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-12-how-to-write-for-multiple-social-media-channels-at-once/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For reference, here&#39;s some prompting questions that are showing up in my social media streams. These change from time to time as online sites try to cajole, coerce, trigger or prompt people to participate online. Typepad wants me to share this post, and to &quot;Enter a short message about your blog post to get people excited to come read it.&quot; Facebook is asking me &quot;What&#39;s the best thing that&#39;s happened to you today?&quot; I&#39;m sure that this is not the only question that Facebook asks, based on other people&#39;s reports, but I haven&#39;t yet seen a comprehensive list of the prompts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-21-prompting-questions/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I'm not "producing content", I'm writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else's interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-01-im-not-producing-content-im-writing/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I have a brainstorm and want to capture it in a bottle before it dissipates. It&#39;s impossible to fit it into a box that allows too few words. A suitably complex thought asks for at least a couple of paragraphs to stretch out its feelers and see if it grabs ahold of anything.&#0160; The Twitter input box doesn&#39;t give the thought enough room to spark. It too quickly fizzles out, bumping into traffic and weather reports that ground it or pop culture that doesn&#39;t pop for it.&#0160; When a great weird idea hits, you want it to hit a dry jack pine tree on a hot day and make it smoulder. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-09-my-great-weird-ideas-dont-fit-in-140-characters/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This weblog has more than 2000 posts in it, and from time to time I sift through it looking at old work looking to make it better.

The ones that need improvement usually need a new lead paragraph, a bunch of formatting cleanup, and some kind of conclusion.&#0160; Rarely does anything here reach the form of art that gets thousands of words to tell a story, at least not all at once. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-05-23-re-editing-old-work/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Publish quickly. The network rewards the first person to show up on the scene to describe what is going on, and it&#39;s important to get a version of that story underway promptly.&#0160; Edit at leisure.&#0160;The editing process takes time, and it shouldn&#39;t be unduly rushed. If necessary, work at it one paragraph at a time, and publish each paragraph after it is finished. Every single piece of work can be improved at any time by an edit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-03-19-first-version-coherent/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The world of Twitter has an infinite demand for your 140 character episodes, but it&#39;s not a satisfying place to compose something that has depth or nuance to it. My daily column of 500 words on AnnArbor.com takes an hour or more to write, and I never have the sense that I can dash it off casually. Perhaps the best approach is to aim for a happy medium. What if the unit of composition is 140 words, not 140 characters? <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-02-27-this-mini-essay-is-exactly-140-words/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>You are given a day to produce something of interest. How much of that time should be spend reading, and how much time should be spent writing? There is a good argument to be made that you want to minimize your research budget and maximize the number of words produced. It&#39;s hard to be a productive writer when the time is spent in the inbox deleting mail or on the net looking aimlessly for something of interest, for neither mode lends itself to long stretches of concentrated thought. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-02-26-readwrite-ratio/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>James Poulos in a comment on Ricochet on the role of editors: Writers now have competing pressures -- to be witty, quick, ironic, noticeable, flip, to dispatch every clay pigeon tossed up by a culture pandemic with pigeons; but also to self-edit, to self-moderate, to be reticent at the right time, to pussyfoot expertly, to pick battles, to avoid perils, to besmirch rarely, to duck blame, to satisfy spectral overseers.

        <p>I wanted to write something short and pithy and insightful for Facebook or Twitter or some other minimalist thing and couldn&#39;t come up with anything. &#0160;The ultrashort format is not suited to ruminations on things you don&#39;t completely understand and are trying to work out in the process of writing about them. Instead I will go for a walk. Perhaps this is a rumination on the length of communications, their immediacy and the expected audience. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-30-the-margin-is-too-small-to-contain-this/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Much of the writing I do these days has tags but not much in the way of categories. There are a few very broad categories that things can go into, but not much in the way of narrow ones, and the world of tags means that you can always think up one more new tag to apply rather than revisiting an old one. In some ways I miss the regular reinforcement obtained by the reminders that I&#39;ve written on items in a category previously in the past. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-03-14-finding-buckets-to-refill-regularly/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I've changed the title of this blog back to Vacuum, since all of the extra gobbledygook was making it hard to bookmark things. The "quick compose" part of Typepad makes it easier to post things that are short that don't have titles, so I don't get stuck figuring out what the title should be and I can just type. Later, when my editor hat goes on, I go back and fix things up and decide what a title might look like. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-02-05-ive-changed-the-title-of-this-blog-back-to-vacuum-since-all-of-the-extra-gobbledygook-was-making-it-hard-to-bookmark-things/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>At various times I&#39;ve carried beautiful little notebooks in my pocket - fancy little bound volumes of paper designed to capture big thoughts and clever notions.&#0160; So fancy (and expensive), in fact, that I felt bad about writing in them unless there was something so clever that it deserved being saved into perpetuity. It was thus reassuring and helpful to go into a big box office supply store and get a modest supply of cheap disposable spiral bound pads, with paper so cheap that it is clear that they are designed to be used and then tossed when you are done with them.&#0160; That plus a supply of cheap pens means that I can have something in my pocket to write things down on and not have to worry that I have to be profound at all. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-22-on-the-virtue-of-cheap-paper/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I was on a trip to Rhode Island last week for a conference (RILA09).&#0160; That gave me a chance to enter &quot;airplane mode&quot;, that rare time in my life when I have lots of time to spend in contemplation but very little network connectivity. And I have to say, I enjoy that time immensely, perhaps more than I enjoy any individual hour trying to be engaged with the net. Airplane mode is a very distinctive time and place to be in.&#0160; You are typically either in an airplane terminal with time to wait for your flight, or sitting buckled into a seat.&#0160; Each experience is essentially the same each time you go, with little meaningful distinction between individual flights; the seat might be a bit noisier or more comfortable, and the terminal a bit more or less dingy, but it&#39;s all of a piece. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-pretending-to-be-on-an-airplane/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here&#39;s an easy recipe for keeping your habits for writing longer format pieces than the 140 character limits of Twitter will allow. 1.&#0160; Write the pithy 140 character Twitter piece, though limit it for a few other technical reasons to 120 or so, better for others to copy. 2.&#0160; Use the headline as a key part of a longer piece that you&#39;ve always wanted to write.&#0160; It might be a punch line inside, it might be a jumping off point for an essay on something completely different, or it might simply be a straightforward summary.&#0160; In any case, write around the start of your post. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-15-blog-more-twitter-less/">&raquo;</a></p>
