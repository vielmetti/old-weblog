        <p>Blog every day, whether you want to or not. Pick a topic, learn it well, and write about it as you learn it. Or pick a topic you know really well already and teach to it. Sometimes you can do both. The time spent blogging can&rsquo;t be any less worthwhile than time spent on Facebook or Twitter. The exchange is, instead of clicking the like button and the favorite button, you actually have to think a little bit and write something down that makes sense. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-28-we-should-do-more-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been converting over old postings on this blog from Typepad. The data export and import was imperfect, and this meant that I&rsquo;ve been poring over the data to figure out what keeps and what goes and what-not. It&rsquo;s a chance to review old words. One of the artifacts of the old hosting platform was a helpful at times system called Zemanta. Zemanta would figure out what you were writing about and give you helpful suggestions for related links, both to things that you had written as well as to things other people had written. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-25-make-tidy/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Where do you write something that's longer than a tweet, but shorter than an essay? There's a space on the net for things that you put together that don't fit into a tweet, but that also don't really require a whole long essay. I've been writing these in my blog for years, and so I have a bit of infrastructure put together for organizing, collecting, and finding them again. A lot of people who are on Twitter don't have a blog, though, and so their fragments stay fragmentary or get lost in the mists of Twitter time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-11-01-where-do-you-write-something-thats-longer-than-a-tweet-but-shorter-than-an-essay/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I&#39;m sure that I write way more than that in aggregate, but I&#39;ve not been keeping up with what was once a habit I attempted: to write a 750 word essay every day. I know that it&#39;s possible to sit down with a single cup of coffee and a single idea and no distractions and crank out 500 words at a sitting. It helps if the coffee doesn&#39;t spill, and if your todo list is in check, and if you have a full sized keyboard and not a tiny phone. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-10-01-do-you-still-write-750-words-a-day/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I am operating with the limitation that I do not currently have a full sized keyboard and screen. The laptop accidentally ingested a cup of coffee. It is getting dried out and the bad bits reclaimed now, and in the meantime I am doing all my computing on either library computers or my Nexus 4 phone. It is often awkward to compose messages and to write on such a small screen, but the screen size is not really the problem. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-23-the-limits-of-the-small-screen-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'd like to do some long form writing, except that I'd publish it on Twitter. I'll write essays as I'd normally write them, making sure that sentences are 140 characters or less. The goal would be to encapsulate an entire argument in pithy sentences and make each one stand on its own. I have no doubt that it would be possible to write quite a few words this way, though you might lose some followers in the bargain. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-02-06-long-form-writing-as-first-published-to-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>

Yes, sometimes they suggest missing things that should be expanded on, and looking at Twitter stats is endlessly fascinating. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-19-analysis-paralysis/">&raquo;</a></p>

Writing in a browser can be very hard work since every other open browser tab wants you to read, not write. You could easily spend hours clicking and not ever utter anything more complex than "like" or "favorite". The one place where writer's block never seems to be a problem is within Twitter, which for better or worse has been the home of 21,158 of my most pithy observations. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-26-the-first-draft-of-this-essay-was-140-characters-or-less/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Mack Collier has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (Here, go read it.) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does. Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!" These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-to-write-amazing-posts-every-time-and-why-you-shouldnt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Here's a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense?

        <p>I'm intrigued of late by the notion of "small wins". This is prompted by reading Wayne Baker's book on social networks in which he quotes Karl Weick. Rather than try to solve big problems all at once, you attack them by making progress on a series of smaller more attainable goals. This keeps morale up and shows you that you're really getting somewhere, even if on the grand scale it doesn't register yet. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-small-wins-and-writing-productivity/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'll start with a confession: I don't think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. ("Self-plagiarism is style.") The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it's not unusual for them to pull something they've done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you're writing formulaic work that's short. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-21-former-ann-arbor-public-schools-principal-accused-of-plagiarism/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm working on an assignment and I'm stuck. This is an attempt to get unstuck. The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that's unlikely to happen on this particular gig - not that they won't see something to fix, but as long as it's turned in on time and is the right shape and size I've had pretty good luck with getting the work approved. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-27-writers-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It&#39;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain. A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don&#39;t write it down now it&#39;ll be gone forever. It&#39;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-10-writing-to-remember-writing-to-forget/">&raquo;</a></p>

Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s 1925 novel&#0160;The Great Gatsby.

        <p>I do a lot of writing in vim these days, in part because my fingers already know how to make words move around on the page. I find it easier to do the work in a place where I can rely on muscle memory for routine changes rather than have to laboriously guide the mouse around to do edits. Once upon a time there was an outlining tool called MaxThink (it still exists, for Windows only) that applied the same kind of keyboard-heavy work to outline editing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-05-01-teaching-your-fingers-to-think/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A France-based school of writing called &quot;Oulipo&quot; embraces a use of constraints in formal writing in order to obtain an interesting result. A most famous case is an entire novel written missing a letter &quot;e&quot;, and a lot of work done on writing long, elaborate palindromes. By work&#39;s end, you are just amazed it&#39;s possible to meet constraints of a stringent writing format. A constraint I am working under now is an absence of an &quot;h&quot; key on my keyboard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-01-01-a-salute-to-oulipo-providing-inspiration-since-my-keyboard-is-missing-a-key-and-i-wonder-if-anyone-w/">&raquo;</a></p>
