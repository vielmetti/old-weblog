      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a review of what people were looking for to find this weblog in previous Octobers.&amp;nbsp; Some of this tells me what I should write about this year, and other parts of it tell me what fads came and went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=ann+arbor+trick+or+treat+hours&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor trick or treat hours (search)&lt;/a&gt;: Every year I try to post a complete list of trick or treat hours for the area; here&#39;s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/halloween_trick.htm&#34;&gt;2005,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/halloween_trick.html&#34;&gt;2006,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2007/09/halloween-trick.html &#34;&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; lists.&amp;nbsp; This year if I&#39;m ambitious I&#39;ll try to get a list of any special events by neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=michigan+spiders&#34;&gt;Michigan spiders (search&lt;/a&gt;): One of the most popular October pages is a writeup I did on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/brown_recluse_s.html &#34;&gt;the brown recluse spider&lt;/a&gt; two years ago; a recent one on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/09/pumpkin-spider.html&#34;&gt;the pumpkin spider&lt;/a&gt; should be good too.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not a coincidence that spiders are part of Halloween decorations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=noguchi+filing+system&#34;&gt;Noguchi filing system (search):&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; In October 2005 I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/noguchi_filing_.html &#34;&gt;Noguchi filing system&lt;/a&gt;, a time-centered approach to filing and memory by a Japanese economist that William Lise had described on his translation web site.&amp;nbsp; Interest spiked ever so briefly in August 2006.&amp;nbsp; Subsequently Lise pulled his excellent descriptive text from the net in response to piracy of his text.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.noguchi.co.jp/&#34;&gt;The Yukio Noguchi web site is all in Japanese&lt;/a&gt; but may help in some way to help you reconstruct this system from his original works describing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=laszlo+bock&#34;&gt;Laszlo Bock, Google (search):&lt;/a&gt; In October 2006, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2006/10/laszlo_bock_goo.html &#34;&gt;Laszlo Bock was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; about changes to the hiring process at Google, describing a system that was going to be more heavily quantified and measured than before.&amp;nbsp; Interest in that clip peaked Jan 2007 and has been consistent.&amp;nbsp; A further &lt;a href=&#34;http://mba.yale.edu/news_events/CMS/Articles/6352.shtml&#34;&gt;interview with Bock by the Yale School of Management&lt;/a&gt; gives few additional insights, but this interesting tidbit: he was an actor in &amp;quot;Showtime kinds of movies&amp;quot;, yet there&#39;s no unambiguous credits for him in IMDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=book+burro&#34;&gt;Book Burro (search):&lt;/a&gt; In October 2006, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/10/book_burro_wins.html&#34;&gt;Firefox plugin Book Burro won 2d prize in a mashups for libraries contest organized by OCLC.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Book Burro watches web sites when you browse and alerts you to information about books referenced on the page, allowing you with a minimum of keyboard and mouse movement to know whether that book from Amazon is in stock at your local library.&amp;nbsp; I wrote about this as part of some broader set of library focused writing at my other blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron&#34;&gt;Superpatron.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in October 2005, I wrote about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2005/10/caribou_coffee_.html&#34;&gt;Caribou Coffee opening up down the street&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s still there, and I&#39;m still a regular.&amp;nbsp; mmm coffee...&lt;/p&gt;
