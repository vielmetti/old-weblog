      <description>I&#39;m working with a few other folks on setting up a relatively regular local group that has discussions of tools like Google Analytics and other systems used to instrument web sites and web applications. We&#39;re looking at a date in January 2014 to start, and a Wednesday as the day of the week we think might work best. Let me know if you&#39;re interested, or join the Ann Arbor Web Analytics Wednesday meetup.</description>

      <title>I&#39;ll miss Google Reader, but it&#39;s no longer how people read this site</title>

      <description>If my Google Analytics reporting is to be behaved, the peak of Google Reader usage for me was in mid 2008, and by early 2010 it had been reduced to background noise. I can understand based on this graph (and perhaps millions of other graphs like it) that it might be time to call it quits.
It looks like from other charts (that I won&amp;#39;t show here) that Twitter picked up the slack, as did Facebook.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics real time vs. mybloglog</title>

      <description>We are writing to inform you that you have now been added to the beta for Google Analytics Real-Time! As we announced the Real-Time reports show you what is happening on your website as it happens.
 Once upon a time, there was mybloglog. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.
Google now has a real time version of Google Analytics, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it.</description>

      <title>mybloglog is officially dead</title>

      <description>You have been identified as a customer of Yahoo! MyBlogLog. We will officially discontinue Yahoo! MyBlogLog effective May 24, 2011. Your agreement with Yahoo!, to the extent that it applies to the Yahoo! MyBlogLog, will terminate on May 24, 2011.&amp;#0160;
 It really died a few years ago, but this at least makes it official. I really liked the service when it was under active development, especially because it tracked click-through on links quite effectively; I am sure there is some way to replicate that using Google Analytics, but I didn&amp;#39;t get far enough into the new event tracking parts of it to make it work.</description>

      <description>Noted:
I lost a few days of Google Analytics data because the setting I made here had an extra space at the end of the GA tracking code.</description>

      <title>How do you measure and value attention?</title>

      <description>We measure things that are easy to measure about media, like
 time on page, time on site  click through rate  conversion rate to some desired action  frequency of interaction  responsiveness of interaction  hot spots that are getting lots of attention  &amp;quot;lag&amp;quot;, whatever that is, but everyone knows what it is   In general, media that have small amounts of lag are good for gaming, because you can play many small bets and iteratively define a better result.</description>

      <description>Of course it isn&amp;#39;t Wednesday yet, but I&amp;#39;ll be a day early.
One of the things I&amp;#39;ve been tracking over at Arborwiki with our analytics install is the fraction of pages that people hit that don&amp;#39;t exist yet.&amp;#0160; These are marked on screen so that if you know what you are looking for you&amp;#39;ll recognize it, but often people don&amp;#39;t, so they click through and get a blank edit screen.</description>
