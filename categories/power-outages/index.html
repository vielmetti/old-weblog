    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Noted as an example of "how do they do that" The RTDS simulates any user-defined electrical system with models of complex electrical components, such as transmission lines, generators and transformers. The components can be precisely defined to match your equipment characteristics. Through real-time simulation, your relay or control equipment is tested in closed-loop mode, acting on the simulated system as it would in the actual installation. Kinetrics has a page on RTDS describing how it's used. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-simulating-a-power-grid-with-rtds/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The challenge I put to myself is to spend not more than $100 and get a functioning solar powered charging station. The alternate name is a "camping power supply" for off-the-grid operations. Breaking down the components it looks like this would be a combination of the following: Solar panel. Estimate as a start that you want to generate 40 watts of power at peak times, using a panel that's small enough and portable enough that you can move it to where there's the best sun, but not necessarily so portable that you're carrying it with you in your backpack. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-06-components-for-a-100-solar-charging-system/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The world of power outage maps is a very fragmented one, with what looks like dozens of designs and systems and no apparent standardization. There's no way that I know to get a USA-wide power outage map without going to all 50 states worth of utilities and piecing together incompatible maps. Some places - like Lansing, Michigan's BWL, don't have maps, making customer communication difficult. If you can't map the whole nation, the next best thing is to count the number of outages nationwide. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-08-how-many-power-outages-are-there-in-the-nation/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Ten years ago, the power went out. It's not unusual for the power to go out, but as always when it happens, you wonder if it's just you or if it's happening to everyone. Who better to know whether things are happening everywhere than your favorite systems administrator? So I called Dave Langhorst, and he reported the grim truth: power is out across a wide area, not just here, and his office phone was only working because of a battery backup. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-14-10-years-ago-the-great-blackout-of-2003/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Hurricane Sandy hit the US East Coast earlier this week, knocking out power to more than 8 million subscribers. The damage to the infrastructure was so severe that it&#39;s expected to take more than a week to bring service back. Here are a few of the better projects online to track the progress of service restoration.

        <p>One of my most popular posts on this blog - especially in times of widespread severe weather - is a list of power outage maps that are available for utility companies across the nation and across the world. There&#39;s a lot of talk about a &quot;smart grid&quot;, and how improvements in technology will lead to more reliable power and other innovations in energy delivery.

        <p>One of the hardest parts of tracking large storms is figuring out the damage to the power infrastructure as the storms roll through. You can get a good grasp on how bad a storm is by how much the power goes out, but each power company&#39;s outage site is different, and there has been no straightforward multi-state combined view.
