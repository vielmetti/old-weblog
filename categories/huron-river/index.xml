      <description>This press release from the City of Ann Arbor was sent to news media on June 28, 2013. As far as I can tell, AnnArbor.com did not run a story. The Ann Arbor Chronicle did publish information about this discharge as part of its meeting reporting for the July 15, 2013 city council meeting.
UPDATE: AnnArbor.com story of July 19, 2013 is up now.
A copy of this news release is available on the Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository (a2docs), but there&amp;#39;s no copy to be found on the City of Ann Arbor web site as of this writing.</description>

      <description>This graph measures water levels downstream from Argo Dam. Water levels are not supposed to fluctuate this much - it&amp;#39;s not good for the river.
More data at the USGS.
Update: I checked with USGS to make sure that the gauges were working fine, and got back this result:
We&amp;#39;re pretty certain everything is working just fine there. I believe we have a hydrologic technician there today making a streamflow measurement and he&amp;#39;ll verify the operation of the equipment at the same time.</description>
