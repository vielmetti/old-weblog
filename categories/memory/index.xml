      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about how I keep track of people who I&amp;#39;ve met over the years. Systems like Facebook try to do that for you (hey! you&amp;#39;re friends with!) but they neglect to capture some critical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most salient points for me about connecting or reconnecting with someone usually revolve around the circumstances of how we first met, the reasons that there&amp;#39;s still some ongoing connection, and the particular details of the last meeting. If I can hit each of those three perspectives on a relationship, chances are that it&amp;#39;s easy to start up a new conversation and easy to call someone to mind when it&amp;#39;s time to make a new introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, most personal address book software does a lousy job of keeping tabs on any of this. You can add a &amp;quot;related to&amp;quot; field in some systems, but that&amp;#39;s not something that I&amp;#39;ve seen pulled out and turned into a full featured exploring tool. If you&amp;#39;re lucky you get to enter some free text in some notes field, but even then you might not get the ability to search it on the fly. And heaven help you if you want to tag or group or categorize or classify people (for your own memory purposes) without fighting a system that generally is indifferent to the idea that people might belong to more than one group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can dream, I&amp;#39;d like the simple app - perhaps just a thin front end to my address book - that flashes names in front of me and helps me quickly remember who&amp;#39;s who and how I might know them. This is multiply true right now because I have a lot of dormant connections to people that I&amp;#39;d like to refresh. A smart address book, or a routine way of collecting that information in a dumb address book, should be able to help that process out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: It turns out that one of the recent updates to LinkedIn adds a &amp;quot;how did I meet you&amp;quot; question, with the ability to link to a person as the introducer. It&amp;#39;s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mental rolodex</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a great use of the term in an LA Magazine review of &amp;quot;Run Lola Run&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lola tosses her red phone up in the air and instantly goes through her mental Rolodex of possibilities. Faces flash on the screen. She decides to hit up her banker father and darts out of the house.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credits: the &amp;quot;mental rolodex&amp;quot; term is one I heard first from&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trybean.com&#34;&gt;Terry Bean&lt;/a&gt;, who used it at an LA2M presentation. It&amp;#39;s also from&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rebekahburgess.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Rebekah Burgess&amp;#39;s weblog of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, where she is doing a daily photograph and filing that away for reference.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And kids, if you don&amp;#39;t know what a rolodex is, it&amp;#39;s from the days when people had land lines phones only and their phones were so dumb that they didn&amp;#39;t have an address book built into them. Instead, they wrote down phone numbers on little pieces of specially shaped paper, and those pieces of paper fit into a clever device that could be flipped through or (in ultra cool setup) spun like a Ferris wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>supermemo and morning coffee ritual memory</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-04-23-supermemo-and-m/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An important piece of having coffee in the morning is making it part of a routine.  If you&#39;re predictable in your habits, you start to see the same people in the same space at the same time, and you get to be something of a regular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re careful, and switch your morning allegiances from time to time but still visit the old haunts often enough, you can be what passes for a regular long after you stopped coming every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often, then, do you need to show up for people to remember you?  For that I turn to structured repetition, and the power of priming memory periodically to strengthen it.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supermemo.com&#34;&gt;Supermemo&lt;/a&gt;, a software package for memory improvement, has a nice paper on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.supermemo.com/articles/paper.htm&#34;&gt;using Supermemo without a computer&lt;/a&gt;, which specifies a pattern of repetitions and intervals to get details into memory.  The table of intervals specified says that you review materials at this pace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 days, 7 days, 12 days, 20 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 5 months, 9 months, 16 months, 2 years, 4 years, 6 years, 11 years, 18 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which suggests that a well-timed practice of showing up at a cafe, introducing yourself to everyone, learning their names, and them coming back at precisely timed intervals to repeat the process would be enough to make you a regular in no time at all.&lt;/p&gt;
