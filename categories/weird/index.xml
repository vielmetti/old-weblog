      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep up a daily pace to blogging here; that&amp;#39;s been my habit for almost ten years. The problem is that it&amp;#39;s not always easy to know what to write about.
I&amp;#39;ve taken to using a few prompting tricks to help sort through some ideas about what to write about. The simplest one is one I haven&amp;#39;t heard of before: use the day of the month as a key into the letters of the alphabet, and thus write about something appropriate for that day.</description>
