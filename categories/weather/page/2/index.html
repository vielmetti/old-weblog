        <p>There&#39;s a storm coming, which may bring some mix of rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, and ice pellets to Ann Arbor. The worst of it will be on Wednesday, March 23 2011, &#0160;the date of the Roman festival of Tubilustrium. This event was&#0160;held in honor of Vulcan, the god of fire and metal working.

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Dayton Daily News notes an overnight frost quake centered around Darke County, Ohio&#0160;on February 10, 2011. The quake, or cryoseism as it’s known in scientific circles, occurs when moisture soaks into the soil and a quick freeze causes a sudden, even violent expansion and contraction. Darke County’s 911 director Brandon Redmond said the quakes erupted for eight hours Thursday, starting at 1 a.m. The heaviest reports were between 5:30-7:30 a.m. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-02-10-the-tremors-come-the-tremors-go-they-love-the-wintry-weather-frost-quakes-in-ohio/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>While it's still fresh, here are some lessons being learned in the middle of watching (and being a small part of) the net's response to Hurricane Gustav.&nbsp; I'm not putting a lot of links in this post. -- Decision to evacuate: It was clear while following Twitter - both directly from the handful of NOLA folks I follow and generally from looking at the net - that people went through a huge amount of decision-making about when and whether to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter looked like an actual help here for the folks I knew, both to help let others know where they were going (or whether they were staying) and to help make the evacuation process somewhat less isolating.&nbsp; &nbsp; Evacuation path: Those who left relatively early had relatively easier driving; by the time evacuation was underway in earnest the traffic jams were huge, some gas stations were temporarily out of gas, and the contraflow caused a lot of congestion when it ended.&nbsp; Twitter again seemed to be useful to help people figure out which non-Interstate highways looked like reasonable exit paths, or at least if it wasn't useful at that moment it was something to file away for next time. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-02-gustav-social-m/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm looking for a weather forecast in RSS which packs as much information into the subject line as possible. By point of comparison, here are a few examples of things that could be better. The weather underground's feed looks like this: Current Conditions - 49.8F / 9.9C | Partly Cloudy - 6:50 AM EDT Apr. 23 Today as of Apr. 23 3:45 AM EDT which is OK for current information (albeit wordy) but useless for the forecast. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-04-23-compact-weather/">&raquo;</a></p>
