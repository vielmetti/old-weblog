This screen shows the ensemble set of forecasts they have for temperature for tomorrow (February 20, 2015), highlighting the 8:00 a.m. reading. You'll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is RAP from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

        <p>When ordinary weather maps don't tell you what the worst of the weather is like out there, I turn to these sources for information. Twitter, especially. A search this morning for "ann arbor ice" gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around. Streets and highways were bad, and a Delta flight slid off the runway at DTW. For Michigan weather follow the #miwx hashtag.

        <p>Flooding of the Bow and Elbow Rivers inundated downtown Calgary, Alberta on June 21, 2013. Flooding and flash flooding has affected large parts of southern Alberta, due in part to a slow-moving storm front that is dumping a lot of rain on the area, up to 7.5 inches in 2.5 days. Three people have died from the flooding.

There&#39;s too much graphic, devastating imagery from the scene which I won&#39;t include here.

Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name. Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.
