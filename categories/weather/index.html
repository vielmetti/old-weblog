You'll note from this graph that there are several weather models they are pulling from. The one of them that has the coldest predicted weather is RAP from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

 Twitter, especially. A search this morning for "ann arbor ice" gave plenty of illustrations why it was not suitable to be out walking around.

In an emergency, call 911.
911 trunk lines can go down in storms. The Ann Arbor non-emergency police number is (734) 994-2911, put it in your cell phone.
Sirens: City sirens are tested on the second Tuesdays of the month at 1 pm. A small handful of us notice this and tweet SIRENS. Generally siren activation in any quantity will prompt twitter chatter.

            <p>It's cold here in Ann Arbor, but we more or less know how to deal with it. Not so in Atlanta, where slippery roads led to gridlock on the highways and midnight traffic jams.

From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:
 It was a day when a 10-mile commute could take you at least six hours. For those heading from downtown to the burbs, it was even worse. The interstates were a gridlocked mess long before the snow finished falling Tuesday. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-29-january-28-2014-atlanta-snowstorm-paralyzes-city/">&raquo;</a></p>

Note that as of 9:30pm January 5, 2014, there is no snow emergency declared for the City of Ann Arbor, but Washtenaw County has declared a "Snow Condition Yellow". From the City of Ann Arbor Facebook:
 The City of Ann Arbor is not declaring a snow emergency at this point, but we are recommending residents move their cars off the streets, if possible, to make it easier for city trucks to plow the full width of streets. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-04-city-of-ann-arbor-snow-emergency-ordinance-10143/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>High winds took down trees and knocked out power to thousands in Washtenaw County the night of 17 November 2013, and the next morning a number of schools and government offices closed because of lack of power.
From various sources including email and twitter; this is surely incomplete.
Ann Arbor Public Schools: Tappan and King are closed today due to power outages at both schools. Tonight's Listen and Learn at Tappan will be rescheduled. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-18-ann-arbor-area-closings-for-monday-18-november-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Flooding of the Bow and Elbow Rivers inundated downtown Calgary, Alberta on June 21, 2013. Flooding and flash flooding has affected large parts of southern Alberta, due in part to a slow-moving storm front that is dumping a lot of rain on the area, up to 7.5 inches in 2.5 days. Three people have died from the flooding.

            <p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but the word &quot;snor&#39;eastercane&quot; is supposedly a portmanteau of &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;nor&#39;easter&quot;, and &quot;hurricane&quot;. Credit to the Wall Street Journal for the name.
 Odds are increasing that a hybrid “snor’eastercane” could make landfall near Greater New York early next week, with wide-ranging impacts affecting nearly the entire East Coast.
 The Twitter hashtag is #snoreastercane and is in use already, with comments like this from @LoriG: &quot;Unexpected consequence of global warming: having to learn the names of a bunch of new types of storms&quot;. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-25-hurricane-sandy-is-being-called-a-snoreastercane/">&raquo;</a></p>

Every single meteorologist is on Twitter (or close enough), and there&#39;s an ample supply of both local weather reporting and national weather forecasting to satisfy anyone&#39;s need to look at weather models for hurricanes to come.

DEXTER, Michigan. As much as possible, I tried not to be the tornado gawker. I probably failed.
Update: photo from Andy Fowler, map from National Weather Service.
Busch&#39;s was giving away water that had been donated, and cookies, to affected residents. Their store was very close to one of the neighborhoods that was worst hit (Huron Farms).
