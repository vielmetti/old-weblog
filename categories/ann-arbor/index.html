        <p>The story is Local News, Off College Presses, from April 13, 2014. The constant changes have muddled The Ann Arbor News’s identity and, according to some residents, eroded its standing as the go-to source of news in the community. That sense was reinforced by the football article, on which The Ann Arbor News played catch-up after student reporters broke the story. Poynter noted in 2011 that the University of Michigan had placed a member of its PR staff on the AnnArbor.com editorial board. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-13-the-new-york-times-notices-when-the-michigan-daily-scoops-the-ann-arbor-news/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From Facebook and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum: Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan. This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no "stay" pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-march-22-2014-washtenaw-county-clerk-to-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>If you're looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there's no better place to stop in than at the Tasty Green Cafe inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn't running at the moment). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-15-tasty-green-cafe-at-ann-arbor-city-hall/">&raquo;</a></p>

The effort to rebuild the corner coffee shop under a new name is expected to take a couple of weeks, with a planned opening date in mid-November. Change is hard, and change in a coffee routine is doubly hard.

        <p>Identify the toilet tank in the basement that no one uses that's leaking. Squirt WD-40 on the stuck valve on the supply line to the tank. Use elbow grease and a vise-grip to turn the supply line valve to "off". Remind people not to use the toilet. Check your daily usage to see that instead of using 200 units of water on a slow day, you're using 50 (!).
