      <title>The New York Times notices when the Michigan Daily scoops the Ann Arbor News</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-13-the-new-york-times-notices-when-the-michigan-daily-scoops-the-ann-arbor-news/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 21:36:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-04-13-the-new-york-times-notices-when-the-michigan-daily-scoops-the-ann-arbor-news/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/business/media/turning-to-college-journalists-for-the-news-in-town-michigan.html?smid=tw-nytmedia&amp;amp;seid=auto&#34;&gt;Local News, Off College Presses&lt;/a&gt;, from April 13, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The constant changes have muddled The Ann Arbor News’s identity and, according to some residents, eroded its standing as the go-to source of news in the community. That sense was reinforced by the football article, on which The Ann Arbor News played catch-up after student reporters broke the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/124839/annarbor-com-blasted-for-putting-u-of-michigan-pr-man-on-editorial-board/&#34;&gt;Poynter noted in 2011&lt;/a&gt; that the University of Michigan had placed a member of its PR staff on the AnnArbor.com editorial board. This drew criticism from former Ann Arbor News reporter Jim Carty at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;David Lampe spent a good six months fighting The Ann Arbor News at every single point of our academics and athletics investigation. He is a well-paid professional spinner for the biggest organization you cover. The idea you would put him on your editorial board would be nothing less than mind-boggling if it weren’t for everything we’ve seen over the past year-plus. Pretty much epic fail on every front at this point, Tony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have a certain degree of editorial freedom to go after the biggest employer in town; the Michigan Daily clearly has it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>March 22, 2014: Washtenaw County Clerk to issue licenses for same-sex marriages</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-march-22-2014-washtenaw-county-clerk-to-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:40:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-march-22-2014-washtenaw-county-clerk-to-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kestenbaum/posts/10153926911120537&#34;&gt;From Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and from Washtenaw County Clerk Larry Kestenbaum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same sex marriage is now the law in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, Judge Friedman of the Eastern District federal court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage in Michigan. Unexpectedly, there was no &#34;stay&#34; pending appeal, and thus the ruling went into effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette is seeking an injunction or stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court may or may not do so. But in the meantime, Judge Friedman&#39;s ruling is the final word on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Vital Records office will be open tomorrow, Saturday (March 22, 2014), from 9am to 1pm, to accept applications and issue marriage licenses. We anticipate that we will be able to process about 60 applications. After 1pm, the staff will not be available. I apologize in advance to those we will have to turn away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we will be giving out numbers on a first-come, first-served basis, but first, we will honor the numbers we gave out last October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that applicants should bring the documents specified on our web site, and $20.01 (for residents of Washtenaw County) or $30.01 (if both members of the couple live out of state). If either member of the couple live in Michigan, and neither one lives in Washtenaw County, you have to go to your own county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional one cent is the fee (set by the Board of Commissioners) for immediate processing of the marriage license. I anticipate that those who apply tomorrow will want immediate processing. If you don&#39;t need your marriage license right away, please wait until Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/cr_vitals_marriage_info.html&#34;&gt;http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/clerk_register/cr_vitals_marriage_info.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A characteristically informative caption in today&#39;s Sunday, January 19 2014 Ann Arbor News.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jan 6, 2014: Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council response to warmth for the homeless</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5108b4ed5970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5108b4ed5970c img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;Temperature-14-below-2014-01-06&#34; title=&#34;Temperature-14-below-2014-01-06&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5108b4ed5970c-800wi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A letter from &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Yousef_Rabhi&#34;&gt;Yousef Rabhi&lt;/a&gt; regarding the homeless, and the response to the storm by Washtenaw County; reproduced with permission. All hyperlinks go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org&#34;&gt;Arborwiki&lt;/a&gt; pages, which should have more detail and explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI: I discussed this issue with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Snow_emergency&#34;&gt;Washtenaw County Snow Emergency Council&lt;/a&gt; and options were discussed. County government has been mobilized to do our part to ensure that members of our community that are homeless are able to keep warm over the next few days.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development&#34;&gt;Office of Community and Economic Development&lt;/a&gt; is working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Delonis_Center&#34;&gt;Delonis&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that we find space for additional individuals. From my understanding, additional capacity was made available today. Another concern that has been raised is that some members of the homeless community are not able to pass a breathalyzer test and so will not be admitted to the Delonis Warming Shelter. Due to the severity of the predicted cold, it appears that Delonis will be more lenient with this policy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The County&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/PORT&#34;&gt;Project Outreach Team&lt;/a&gt; has been delivering sleeping bags, and other warming materials to individuals that are camping outside tonight. Through site visits and other methods, they have established an accounting of individuals that are sleeping outside and their needs. For those that do not have access to warming at the Delonis Center, &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/PORT&#34;&gt;PORT&lt;/a&gt; has offered accommodations to house those individuals and keep them warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Health is also working with their Emergency Officer to respond to public health concerns as they arise. &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Washtenaw_County_Public_Health&#34;&gt;Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/PORT&#34;&gt;PORT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/CSTS&#34;&gt;Community Support and Treatment Services&lt;/a&gt; and The &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Office_of_Community_and_Economic_Development&#34;&gt;Office of Community and Economic Development&lt;/a&gt; have been working around the clock to ensure that folks stay warm tonight. With the cold setting in, we must remain vigilant to ensure that no one falls though the cracks. If anyone hears of any issues of people being turned away from the warming center, please contact me. We will ensure that resources are available to help those that need warmth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your concern on this matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YDR&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday, 7 December 2013 - ANN ARBOR - It looks like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org&#34;&gt;a2gov.org&lt;/a&gt; web site is not functioning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error behavior is strange, in that every valid page fetched yields a blank page, but if you go to a page that&#39;s not valid on the site you get a 404 error (and another blank page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if a2gov.org email is also affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: All systems appear to be functioning correctly again at 3:10p Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE 12/7/13: Mostly. All articles on the old site now redirect to mlive.com. I am told this will be back working by Monday 12/9/13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b02390333970b-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b02390333970b&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; alt=&#34;Screen shot 2013-12-06 at 12.58.24 AM&#34; title=&#34;Screen shot 2013-12-06 at 12.58.24 AM&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b02390333970b-600wi&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea if it will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all www.annarbor.com URLs redirect to the MLive Ann Arbor home page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a good time and a lively discussion at the 3d Ann Arbor Civic Technology meetup. There were about 18 people in attendance, including the City of Ann Arbor CFO/CIO, the webmaster from Washtenaw County, several U of Michigan SI students, some townies, a fellow who drove down from Lansing who had organized Code Michigan hackathon, and a number of folks who were drawn in from Meetup. (who did I miss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everyone introduced themselves we did a few rounds of discussion of the projects that people were working on with public data as well as some talk about data that wasn&#39;t available in easy formats. Projects included&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the detailed data from the 1,4 Dioxane plume that is spreading under Ann Arbor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traffic crash facts and accident reports to inform pedestrian safety discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;estimating rental property utility costs from crowdsourced data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;liberating restaurant inspections from proprietary databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data about dangerous buildings and nuisance properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopt-a-storm-drain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;report from a &#34;data dive&#34; that looked at non-profit data in a hackathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(what did I miss)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of these projects were actively in development (several were &#34;gee wouldn&#39;t be nice if&#34;) and there was not one single effort that everyone focused on. Instead it was a healthy back and forth about a lot of possible directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started at 7p and ended at 830p, and people stayed around talking until 9p. I&#39;m happy with the turnout and with the people who showed up, and am hopeful that the next meeting (in January) will be as well received. We had an offer to host it in a Washtenaw County facility for the next event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor is a downtown issue, as illustrated by this map of 2012 car-pedestrian crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, if anything, is the Ann Arbor DDA and the City of Ann Arbor doing to make the downtown streetscape safer for pedestrians? Most of the rhetoric in recent City Council meetings has been about pedestrian safety in neighborhoods, but that&#39;s visibly not the only issue at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive (CVGA) Fifth Anniversary</title>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-16-university-of-michigan-computer-and-video-game-archive-cvga-fifth-anniversary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;Aael-cvga-300x225&#34; title=&#34;Aael-cvga-300x225&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef019b0136b662970c-800wi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I went with S and J to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive&#34;&gt;University of Michigan Computer and Video Game Archive&lt;/a&gt; (CVGA) on the UM North Campus in the basement of the Duderstadt Center. They were celebrating their fifth anniversary with cupcakes and a Mario tournament. The boys had a chance to play games, and I had a chance to talk to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman&#34;&gt;David S. Carter&lt;/a&gt; (aka superman@umich.edu) about the collection. Here are some notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 5000 games in the collection, and about half of them are donated. An annual collection budget of about $13,000 buys new games and the occasional old console from eBay. The archive has a near complete collection of US consoles, and Dave said they are looking to expand their international coverage. One of their latest acquisitions was a DVD system that plays only one title. The archive would like to improve its collection of handheld games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge of the next five years is with digital rights management (DRM). The DRM systems envisioned would lock a game to a particular piece of console hardware, making it impossible to have used games and very hard for a library to add a title to a collection. For network-delivered games like Steam it&#39;s equally hard for the library to spend $10 on a license, when licenses negotiated by libraries for things like electronic versions of journals are usually for much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave said the archive was pretty much where they want to be after 5 years. He knew they were on the right track when they got space in the library even before they had a budget. The challenge of next five years is less collection building and more about building connections across campus and around the world to other research collections. He compared the collection to early film and video collections, now standard at all research libraries, but once considered a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other comparable collections are at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/videogamearchive/index.php&#34;&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=&#34;http://library.stanford.edu/news/2013/03/stanford-libraries-preserves-historical-software-collection-federal-agency&#34;&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;. Public libraries so not tend to have research collections, preferring to  either use video games strictly for events or to have a circulating collection where you check out current games like any other video or music media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Dave about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/historicalsoftware&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&#39;s online gaming collection&lt;/a&gt;, and especially about the role of emulation in preserving games. He told me that emulation does not preserve original game play, especially the ergonomics of controllers. Playing on original game hardware with original video hardware gives you an accurate rendition of original game play experience. (Besides, you can&#39;t play &lt;a href=&#34;http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/005840579&#34;&gt;Duck Hunt&lt;/a&gt; without an old fashioned TV because the game depends on sensing the scan lines on the TV.) Some old games are very hard to enjoy on original hardware and the limitations of the controls, not the game itself, are what trips up your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working with a few other folks on setting up a relatively regular local group that has discussions of tools like Google Analytics and other systems used to instrument web sites and web applications. We&#39;re looking at a date in January 2014 to start, and a Wednesday as the day of the week we think might work best. Let me know if you&#39;re interested, or join the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ann-Arbor-Web-Analytics-Wednesday/events/151859352/&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Web Analytics Wednesday meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tasty Green Cafe at Ann Arbor City Hall</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-15-tasty-green-cafe-at-ann-arbor-city-hall/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-15-tasty-green-cafe-at-ann-arbor-city-hall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re looking to bump into city employees and talk shop, there&#39;s no better place to stop in than at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Tasty_Green_Cafe&#34;&gt;Tasty Green Cafe&lt;/a&gt; inside Ann Arbor City Hall. The menu includes the usual coffee drinks plus lunchtime choices like meat and spinach pies. There are three tables inside and a few more outside on the patio, and you get a nice view of the city hall fountain (which isn&#39;t running at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch (a meat pie and a coke) was $5.01. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked briefly with City Attorney &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Stephen_Postema&#34;&gt;Stephen Postema&lt;/a&gt; and his thoughts on proposed FOIA legislation coming from Lansing (he&#39;s skeptical). I told him about my new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnarbor.com/2013/11/welcome-to-foia-friday.html&#34;&gt;FOIA Friday column on Damn Arbor&lt;/a&gt;, and he recognized Damn Arbor because it once wrote about his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnarbor.com/2011/04/what-if-anything-is-hipster.html&#34;&gt;status as a hipster&lt;/a&gt; (he&#39;s not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental Coordinator &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Matt_Naud&#34;&gt;Matt Naud&lt;/a&gt; and I talked about the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://meetup.com/a2civictech&#34;&gt;a2civictech meetup&lt;/a&gt;, and he referred me to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wegowise.com/&#34;&gt;WeGoWise&lt;/a&gt; program in Boston that&#39;s reducing people&#39;s energy and water bills - similar, in spirit at least, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dteenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=26817&amp;amp;item=72330&#34;&gt;OPower insert&lt;/a&gt; in my recent DTE bill that told us we used a lot of electricity compared to our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ann Arbor SPARK audited financial statements are on a2docs.org</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-08-ann-arbor-spark-audited-financial-statements-are-on-a2docsorg/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 18:49:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-08-ann-arbor-spark-audited-financial-statements-are-on-a2docsorg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Audited financial statements for Ann Arbor SPARK are available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2docs.org&#34;&gt;a2docs&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of Kai Petainen who obtained them from the State of Michigan Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2docs.org/doc/320/&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor SPARK 2012 Audited Financial Statement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2docs.org/doc/321/&#34;&gt;SPARK Audited Financial Statements 2006 to 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://a2docs.org&#34;&gt;a2docs&lt;/a&gt; is the Ann Arbor Area Government Document Repository, &#34;A place to upload documents relevant to local governance.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media commentary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kaipetainen/2013/11/09/non-profit-venture-capital-firm-refuses-to-release-audited-financial-statements-before-governor-snyders-nerd-fund-there-was-spark/&#34;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, a story by Kai Petainen: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Tom Crawford at city hall, 100% of the LDFA money to SPARK (about $1.5 million) is for local companies.  If so, then why does the audited financial statement say this:  ”$275,000 is available for companies location in the City of Ann Arbor via funding from the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti Local Development Financing Authority (LDFA)”&#34;?  Where does the other $1.2 million go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/11/09/a2-ann-arbor-spark-3/&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; notes the Forbes story and quotes this selection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I got the financial documents. But, how did I do it? SPARK didn’t give me the documents. My local government didn’t give me the documents – they told me that they didn’t have them. I had to go to the Attorney General in Michigan for the documents. The Attorney General’s office gave them to me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing yet as of Saturday night, November 9, 2013 from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mlive.com/ann-arbor&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor News&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.heritage.com/ann_arbor_journal/&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
