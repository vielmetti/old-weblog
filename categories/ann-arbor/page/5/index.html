            <p>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff.
Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-02-18-ann-arbor-municipal-irritant/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Ann Arbor plow truck public tracking page shows where the snow plows are out and about in Ann Arbor.

This view shows 4 of the 5 trucks that were out on Monday evening, January 2, 2012.
Plow routes are color coded, and plow trucks are numbered. One tip: if you are using Chrome, turn on and off the &quot;label&quot; field to get the trucks to show.
The system is build by Radio Satellite Integrators, and uses ESRI map technology. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-01-02-ann-arbor-plow-trucks-public-tracking/">&raquo;</a></p>

The outage affects over 1400 customers in Burns Park, Lower Burns Park, and along South State Street. I can't tell from the map whether University of Michigan facilities are also affected, but the report from the dotcom is that traffic signals are also affected along Packard and on East Stadium near the Stadium Bridges project. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-12-07-burns-park-elementary-school-closed-december-7-2011-due-to-power-outage/">&raquo;</a></p>

 I agree! There is a serious lack of sandwich reporting on this website. I, for one, love sandwiches. What if all the pet stories were sandwich stories instead? Everyone isn't into pets, but who doesn't like sandwiches? Not anyone I want living in my town.

So I will go two new ways
Down your one way street
 A bridge to nowhere

 Confusion arrives
Cars become pedestrians
Can't wait for State Street!

The bridge is being torn down?
How do I get home?

            <p>ANN ARBOR (December 5, 2011): There are a number of neighborhoods in Ann Arbor where there are citizens who receive newspapers, and "newspaper-like items", where the citizen does not pay for the newspaper. We receive a free copy of the Ann Arbor Journal, and there are some neighborhoods where a number of students receive the Wall Street Journal gratis.
Alas, not everyone who gets a free paper opens it up in time for it to be useful, and some of it turns into litter. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-11-21-ann-arbor-city-council-anti-free-newspaper-law/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the Stadium Bridges project are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.
The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign M4-9b. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-11-17-pedestrian-detour-lower-burns-park-signs/">&raquo;</a></p>
