        <p>Some notes, before I quit for the night, from the launch of AnnArbor.com . We went live at 8pm Thursday.&#0160; I took a nap after coming home from work, got up at about 830pm, and went online looking at the comments; most of that evening was spent answering comments, dealing with details, being helpful and present and attentive.&#0160; As much as possible, I tried to be like Caterina and George were like at the launch of Flickr.&#0160; (I wish I had a better quote for this; here&#39;s the one I could find from Pinhead&#39;s Progress in 2006) They wanted to make Flickr so that users were facing each other, instead of facing the website. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-25-whoosh-site-launch-for-annarborcom/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The Jolly Pumpkin has a sign up at 311 S Main St, where Pepperz used to be, in downtown Ann Arbor. Barbara Tozier snapped a photo of the sign, a photo which has been making its rounds of the beer-loving community around town. Permits were approved for the space on July 21, 2009 for electrical work; ELEC09-0838 goes to contractor Top Line Electric LLC.

        <p>Another copy of the Ann Arbor Gerbil showed up on my sidewalk this morning. &#0160;It&#39;s nice to have a morning paper, much nicer than the mid-afternoon Ann Arbor Snooze that used to never arrive quite early enough to read over lunch, and by the time it got to be after dinner to read it it was most of a day old. Some of last week&#39;s Gerbils that were left on lawns unread decayed enough to leave crumbs of newspaper on the lawns of apartment buildings on Packard, no worse so far than the occasional decaying NY Times or Wall St Journals that sometimes pile up in front of student rentals unread. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-17-a-blogger-reads-the-newspaper-day-13/">&raquo;</a></p>
