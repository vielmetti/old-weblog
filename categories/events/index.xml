      <description>Here&#39;s a design for a low overhead way to post about events coming up in Ann Arbor. Follow @a2events on Twitter if you want to play along.
The first rule of business is that every event has to have a URL, and the more simple and direct the URL is the more likely it is that it&#39;s authoritative for the event. If an event doesn&#39;t have a URL yet, I&#39;ll blog about it here if I need to post about it.</description>

      <description>Every Thursday at the a2b3 lunch, we talk about upcoming events for the next week and month and season for the Ann Arbor area. It&#39;s a good way to hear about what&#39;s coming up, and to hear from people who are organizing events in the future who need help now for planning and gaining support.
I&#39;ve been unburdening my inbox of events notices by sending them out to Twitter. It strikes me that I could almost as easily do that here in this weblog, since there&#39;s an &#34;</description>

      <description>BREAKING: Special Event Press Conference today @ Noon (EDT). Historic event to be held at Michigan Stadium. #BigHouse
&amp;mdash; Michigan Tix Office (@umichtix) April 4, 2014 
The working assumption is that this is the long-rumored summer soccer game between Manchester United and Real Madrid in August. From Crain&#39;s Detroit:
 Global soccer powerhouses Manchester United — wearing its new Chevrolet-sponsored jerseys — and Real Madrid will square off at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor at 4 p.</description>

      <description>We had 11 in attendance for the April 2014 edition of the Ann Arbor Web Analytics Wednesday group, which meets roughly monthly at Enlighten on the west side of Ann Arbor. This month&#39;s meeting was sponsored by Tealium, a tag management vendor. Thanks to Chris Grant for being my co-organizer for the event. I won&#39;t try to summarize what was said by whom in what order, because discussion went around and around the table a few times.</description>

Now in its sixth year, the Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire features dozens of makers from across the region and draws over three thousand members of the community for the day’s free events. Metalworkers, inventors, papermakers, artists, students, robot designers, enthusiasts and professional alike teach the public how they make their work. Many participants come away with more than just inspiration, but new skills they can use to fuel their own creations and lasting connections to other makers and resources in the region.</description>

      <description>SXSW is &#34;spring break for geeks&#34;. Every year the nerd bird flies hundreds of people from San Francisco to Austin (and to be fair other airplanes fly other people from other places to Austin). There&#39;s a good solid week of product demos, parties, music, film, etc. It sounds like fun, and I&#39;ve never gone. I&#39;m wondering what my alternate history would have been if I would have been a regular there - who would I know that I don&#39;t know now, what connections I&#39;d make, etc.</description>

      <description>A Death Cafe is a safe place where people get together to talk about death and have tea and delicious cake. The idea originated in Switzerland as the &amp;quot;cafe mortel&amp;quot;, is organized from the UK, and has spread to France, Australia and the US. Events are low key, held in public places, and are safe and informal.&amp;#0160;
The Ann Arbor Death Cafe is the first of these events to be held in Michigan.</description>

      <description>If your birthday friend is in Ann Arbor, tell them about the list of deals you can get on your birthday in Ann Arbor kept on Arborwiki. &amp;#0160; There&amp;#39;s good eating to be had at a discount, breakfast lunch dinner and dessert.
Two weeks ahead of time, get notified by Plaxo by email.&amp;#0160; That gives you enough time to update the email and postal address and send a postcard.&amp;#0160; (Note: the &amp;quot;everyone gets a postcard&amp;quot; bit is something I aspire to; still haven&amp;#39;t figured out all of the infrastructure yet, though I have a postcard project to track what I can.</description>

      <description>Dinah made up a holiday called Discardia. She wrote:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to invent a new holiday called Discardia. It takes place in the time between the Solstices &amp;amp; Equinoxes and their following new moons. Discardia is celebrated by getting rid of stuff and ideas and habits you no longer need. On the Discardian new moon you don&amp;rsquo;t buy anything or bring anything into your home and enjoy the fact that you have enough.</description>

We&#39;re also encouraging people to talk about (and do something about) internet issues they&#39;re worried about - censorship, the digital divide, inadequate connectivity generally.</description>
