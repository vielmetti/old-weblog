      <description>Some references to collect here on the use of general-purpose graphic processors in OCR.&amp;#0160; Nominally, you run some kind of MapReduce based algorithm with a GPGPU over some image, and out spits text much faster than any ordinary processor of any speed; of course, there are lots of details to attend to.

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s some notes about parallel computing, going in two directions at the same time.&amp;#0160; In one direction you have tools like Map/Reduce or Hadoop managing the work of parceling a problem into many pieces and then coordinating the collection of those pieces.&amp;#0160; In another direction you have graphics chips being turned into interesting general purpose parallel computing chips that can do some specific operations very fast.
It&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of clippings, in part because I don&amp;#39;t have a whole story yet, just the fragments.</description>
