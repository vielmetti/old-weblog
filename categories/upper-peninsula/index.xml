      <description>There&#39;s no better way to learn about your home town than by trying to start a wiki for it. In that regard, I&#39;m happy to announce a new Localwiki installation for Marquette County, Michigan.

Unfortunately, a handful of participants abused the system. While most comments were astute and relevant, some relentless individuals decided to turn the comments section into a chat room that ventured, frankly, into the realm of inappropriate, sophomoric idiocy.</description>
