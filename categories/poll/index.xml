      <description>Polls are fun ways to get people&amp;#39;s opinions, and the All Our Ideas website is a particularly good form of this polling because it lets readers add their own suggestions.
As an introduction to this, here&amp;#39;s a simple poll: what are good ways that you suggest to meet new people? You&amp;#39;ll get a choice of two from the list to pick which one is better, and if you have a better idea you can add it in.</description>
