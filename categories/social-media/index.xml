      <description>I&#39;ve deleted Facebook from my phone, though I haven&#39;t closed out my account there. Look for me to be there less and here (on this blog) more.
Facebook is a never ending stream. You start to look at it, and you are never done. There&#39;s never a &#34;congratulations, you are all caught up&#34; message to be found. It&#39;s just too big to make sense of, and too much of a potential time sink.</description>

      <title>Facebook, where it&#39;s hard to keep a conversation going and find it again later</title>

      <description>I have taken to using Facebook as a place where I put a second copy of something I&#39;ve already written and published somewhere else. That ensures that in some way I&#39;ll be able to find it, probably by googling my blog posts. Things written on Facebook disappear into the ether too quickly (including this thread which will die quietly when we are all done with it).
Facebook Communities suffer from the problem that they don&#39;t really provide an equal forum for all people to share jointly in a topic discussion.</description>

      <title>Taking a vow of silence on Facebook</title>

      <description>I&#39;m still reading the darned thing, and sometimes I click on the links. But for now, at least, I&#39;m taking a vow of silence on Facebook. No poking people, no one-click birthday wishes, and no back-and-forth banter punctuated by screen refreshes hoping that there&#39;s something else of interest to look at.
I like you all out there in Facebook land, but something has to give, and I&#39;d rather be an old-school blogger that still puts out a post or two a week than an ace Facebook user with little to show for it after years of work except calluses on my fingers.</description>

      <description>via archivist Jeff Ubois, this account of using needle sorting cards for human intelligence gathering:
 Alfred De Grazia, with Floyd Hunter and Paul Deutschmann, wrote a training manual in 1954 for the State Dept., &#34;DISCOVERING NATIONAL ELITES A Manual of Methods for Discovering the Leadership of a Society and Its Vulnerabilities to Propaganda&#34; that includes an approach to social network analysis for &#34;propaganda-target analysis&#34; based on punch cards.
