      <description>notes from day 14 at annarbor.com
Why was the launch scrubbed this time?

Hydrogen leaks (STS-127) (STS-73)Thunderstorms (STS-93)Problem circuit card in the pyrotechnic initiator controller (STS-51)
Perseid meteor shower&amp;#0160;(STS-51)
I didn&amp;#39;t see a complete list of all possible reasons, but there are lots of problems that can happen when you launch into space. &amp;#0160;I watched two launches in the last few days - the SpaceX rocket which went up without a hitch, and the shuttle which went up on its 6th try, all very exciting to see.</description>
