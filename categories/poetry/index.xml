      <description>The rented lakes of my childhood by Marge Piercy
 I remember the lakes of my Michigan childhood. Here they are called ponds. Lakes belonged to summer, two-week vacations that my father was granted by Westinghouse when we rented some cabin. Never mind the dishes with spiderweb cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce pans, the crusted black frying pans. Never mind the mattresses shaped like the letter V. Old jangling springs. Moldy bathrooms.</description>

      <description>Yes, it is spring But with our kind of luck We&amp;#39;re surrounded&amp;#0160; By great mounds of muck  Yes, we hear some birds sing But the dominate thing is the beep, beep of a&amp;#0160; Backing up truck. </description>

      <description>There are, it seems, two muses: the Muse of Inspiration, who gives us inarticulate visions and desires, and the Muse of Realization, who returns again and again to say &amp;quot;It is yet more difficult than you thought.&amp;quot; This is the muse of form. It may be then that form serves us best when it works as an obstruction, to baffle us and deflect our intended course. It may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work and when we no longer know which way to go, we have begun our real journey.</description>

      <description>David Bloom holds forth in song in Off I Go To The County Board, one of the few songs written about the process of covering public meetings.
Off I Go To The County Board,
inspired by Mary Morgan
Off I Go To The County Board,
To hear the rabble bray,
Of taxes met, infractions scored,
On this harumphing day.
 Oh Washtenaw, brave Washtenaw,
Of eighty-three, the best.
The other counties hold in awe,</description>

      <description>Last night, as I was sleeping,
I dreamt - marvelous error! -
that I had a beehive
here inside my heart.
And the golden bees
were making white combs
and sweet honey
from all my old failures.
(Antonio Machado, translated by Robert Bly)
Last night I had a dream—
a blessed illusion it was—
I dreamt of a hive at work
deep down in my heart.
Within were the golden bees</description>

      <description>I must learn to love the fool in me—the one who feels too much, talks too much, takes too many chances, wins sometimes and loses often, lacks self-control, loves and hates, hurts and gets hurt, promises and breaks promises, laughs and cries. It alone protects me against that utterly self-controlled, masterful tyrant whom I also harbor and who would rob me of human aliveness, humility and dignity but for my fool.</description>

The House Was Quiet and the World Was Calm
The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The reader became the book; and summer night
Was like the conscious being of the book. The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The words were spoken as if there was no book,
Except that the reader leaned above the page,
Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be</description>

      <description>Edna St. Vincent Millay: This Gifted Age

Upon this age, that never speaks its mind,
This furtive age, this age endowed with power
To wake the moon with footsteps, fit an oar
Into the rowlocks of the wind, and find
What swims before his prow, what swirls behind &amp;mdash;
Upon this gifted age, in its dark hour,
Rains from the sky a meteoric shower
Of facts &amp;hellip; they lie unquestioned, uncombined.</description>

Busman&amp;#39;s Honeymoon

a city bus—whether full of passengers, 
friends and strangers, or with no one but the driver, 
or empty, dead in the water of lot or barn:</description>

      <description>THE ROAD TO WISDOM
The road to wisdom? -- Well, it&#39;s plain
and simple to express:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and err
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and err again
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; but less
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and less
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and less.
CONSTITUTIONAL POINT
Power corrupts, whereas sound opposition
builds up our free
democratic tradition.

      <description>Jim Johnson is the 2008-2010 poet laureate of Duluth, Minnesota. From a profile of Jim Johnson by writer Cheryl Reitan in the mnartists.org site:
 JIM JOHNSON, THE RECENTLY CHOSEN 2008-2010 DULUTH POET LAUREATE, writes poetry that is cut from the cloth of his Finnish roots. While much of his work recalls the lives of Finnish settlers in northern Minnesota, the message is universal. It is the quintessentially American story of the immigrant experience and of families, hunger, nature, and hard work.</description>

      <description>via the V. V. Mayakovsky bio in the Encyclopedia of Soviet Authors:
In 1925 Mayakovsky also made one of his few forays into the sphere of utopian science fiction with his poem Letaiushchi Proletarii (&#34;The Flying Proletarian&#34;). As described by Victor Tarras in his biography of Mayakovsky, The Flying Proletarian was:
...set in the year 2125 and features a giant air battle, with death rays and such, between the Soviet proletarian and the American bourgeois air forces.</description>

      <description>Late August, given heavy rain and sun
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet
Like thickened wine: summer&#39;s blood was in it
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots</description>

      <description>Winter &amp;nbsp;
 CLOUDED with snow  The cold winds blow, And shrill on leafless bough The robin with its burning breast  Alone sings now. &amp;nbsp;
 The rayless sun,  Day&#39;s journey done, Sheds its last ebbing light On fields in leagues of beauty spread  Unearthly white. &amp;nbsp;
 Thick draws the dark,  And spark by spark, The frost-fires kindle, and soon Over that sea of frozen foam  Floats the white moon.</description>
