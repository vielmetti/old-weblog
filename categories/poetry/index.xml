      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rented lakes of my childhood 
 by Marge Piercy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 I remember the lakes of my Michigan
 childhood. Here they are called ponds.
 Lakes belonged to summer, two-week
 vacations that my father was granted by
 Westinghouse when we rented some cabin.

 Never mind the dishes with spiderweb
 cracks, the crooked aluminum sauce
 pans, the crusted black frying pans.
 Never mind the mattresses shaped
 like the letter V. Old jangling springs.

 Moldy bathrooms. Low ceilings
 that leaked. The lakes were mysteries
 of sand and filmy weeds and minnows
 flickering through my fingers. I rowed
 into freedom. Alone on the water

 that freckled into small ripples,
 that raised its hackles in storms,
 that lay glassy at twilight reflecting
 the sunset then sucking up the dark,
 I was unobserved as the quiet doe

 coming with her fauns to drink
 on the opposite shore. I let the row-
 boat drift as the current pleased, lying
 faceup like a photographer’s plate
 the rising moon turned to a ghost.

 And though the voices called me
 back to the rented space we shared
 I was sure I left my real self there-
 a tiny black pupil in the immense
 eye of a silver pool of silence.

&lt;/pre&gt;

They said that
my telephone
would be fixed
     by 6.
They guaranteed
     it. 
&lt;/pre&gt;
