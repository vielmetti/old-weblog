        <p>My current laptop (a MacBook Air) has a plenty fast processor and super fast disk. This means that the usual bottleneck for system operations is the network, not the computer itself. I go from wifi spot to other wifi spot enough that I know that performance varies a lot, and especially there are a lot of places where the network is really not fast enough. Enter GNU Parallel. This little tool lets you spawn a whole series of processes, with the next one starting when the previous one completes. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-06-24-using-gnu-parallel-to-speed-up-network-operations/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The project of the week has been an effort to generate a set of maps - 2935 of them, in fact. The source data is from the Department of Energy, listing a set of utility companies and the counties they cover; the goal is to have a boundary map generated for each utility company. I know it won&rsquo;t be a perfect boundary (most utility companies have at least one county that they only provide service to part of), but as a start it&rsquo;s a pretty good one. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-04-cleaning-polygons-in-r-and-shapely/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some maps of South Sudan, which is in the news today because of an emerging civil war. UNOCHA South Sudan describes the displaced persons in South Sudan: On 20-21 December (2013), the security situation remained stable but tense in Juba. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people are sheltering at the two main UNMISS bases in town.

        <p>On the Sperry-Piltz Ice Accumulation Index: The Sperry–Piltz Ice Accumulation Index, or SPIA Index, is a forward-looking, ice accumulation and ice damage prediction index that uses an algorithm of researched parameters that, when combined with National Weather Service forecast data, predicts the projected footprint, total ice accumulation, and resulting potential damage from approaching ice storms. It is a tool to be used for risk management and/or winter weather preparedness. The index is named after its co-developers, Sidney Sperry of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives and Steven Piltz, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Tulsa. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-21-ice-storm-of-december-21-22-2013-and-the-sperry-piltz-ice-accumulation-index/">&raquo;</a></p>
