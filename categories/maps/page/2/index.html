        <p>I was out for a walk along the Huron River, and Runtastic mapped it as though I was actually in the middle of the river. There&#39;s actually a path in the &quot;middle&quot; of the river, a berm that separates the Argo Cascades city park from the Huron River per se. Microsoft and Nokia don&#39;t appear to know about that path, just illustrating some of the perils of computing walking directions in an urban environment. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-21-walking-on-water/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>ANN ARBOR (June 29, 2012) An intense storm called a derecho with long lived straight line winds passed to the south of the area today. The Disaster Mapping weblog entry 6/29/2012 Derecho has a good summary of the impact to the power grid from storm, which had knocked out power to over 3 million people as of 11:45 p.m from Illinois all the way to DC. Wind gusts of over 90 miles per hour were clocked in some areas as the storm blew through. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-29-derecho-of-june-29-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>MinnPost.com has an excellent visualization of the &quot;Nice Ride&quot; bike system in Minneapolis. They took GPS data from 40+ bikes in that system and mapped out where they were going on a typical day in the system. Here&#39;s a snapshot from mid-afternoon ; the base map grid shows the most commonly used routes. The system began in Minneapolis two years ago. With the St. Paul expansion, there are now 146 stations with 1,328 bikes available stretching between Minneapolis’ Uptown and St. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-08-mapping-the-nice-ride-free-bicycles-in-minneapolis/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Washington, DC is getting a new Metro map, and some new services. Called Rush Plus, it&#39;s designed to add additional service to existing lines and to change the rush-hour routing of some trains so that you can make more connections without a transfer. The full Metro map is here, in all its PDF glory; the sample below is hoped to be a reasonable size.
