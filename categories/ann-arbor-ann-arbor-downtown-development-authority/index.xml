      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks all for your suggestions; I gave them my 4 minutes. Here&amp;#39;s what I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. &amp;#0160;Not going to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/08/link-bus-2008-m.html&#34;&gt;the Link Bus and how bad the signage is&lt;/a&gt;; I did my own pocket schedule and now I&amp;#39;m OK.&amp;#0160; This is not the right board to give that feedback to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
2. &amp;#0160;Not going to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2008/12/the-bus-game-why-its-important-to-get-the-aatas-mobile-ridetrak-back-online.html&#34;&gt;how the AATA Ridetrak is down&lt;/a&gt; and how it&amp;#39;s been down for a month; that&amp;#39;s a message to the AATA board, not this board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3. &amp;#0160;Not going to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodspeedupdate.com/2008/2368&#34;&gt;Rob Goodspeed&amp;#39;s article showing that structures are on average half empty&lt;/a&gt; (which got an immediate response from Rene Greff), because I don&amp;#39;t generally drive to town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I did talk about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidewalks are not promptly cleared after snow storms, to the detriment of pedestrians. &amp;#0160;In particular there is a dangerous part at the curb, where &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/government/safetyservices/Police/Pages/SnowRemovalonSidewalks.aspx&#34;&gt;the property owner (who is responsible for the sidewalk)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a2gov.org/GOVERNMENT/PUBLICSERVICES/FIELDOPERATIONS/Pages/SnowRemoval.aspx&#34;&gt;the city (who is responsible for the street)&lt;/a&gt; share responsibility for the failure to clear the curb, resulting in huge puddles at corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I showed the DDA my pair of Yaktrax (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/yaktrax&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/yaktrax&lt;/a&gt;) and suggested that someone could make good money selling them from a cart on the street on icy days. (thanks to John Hritz for that timely holiday present).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for more coverage from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchronicle.com&#34;&gt;Ann Arbor Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
