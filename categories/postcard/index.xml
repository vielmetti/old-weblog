      <description>A few highlights, not the whole talk.
My notes for the talk were the four words: novelty, reciprocity, frequency, mobility.
For novelty I spoke to the notion that people are on a perpetual search for the next new thing, and that any solution to any problem has to be revisited periodically in the light of this.
Reciprocity is the notion that people will respond in kind if you act generously to them, and I spoke to how this plays out in social media with &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;followers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;likes&amp;quot; as the actions often reciprocated.</description>

      <description>My old camera now always takes pictures that looks like the Northern Lights. It went into the closet after it failed and after cell phone cameras started taking good enough photos, but perhaps it&#39;s time to restore it to art photography use for the postcard series.</description>

      <description>If I were to hive off another blog from this one, today I&amp;#39;d do the postcard blog; one that somehow every single post in the blog had the word postcard in the title and postcard in the first paragraph. All postcards all the time, and a design that looked like it was made for postcards.</description>
