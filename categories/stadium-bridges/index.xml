      <description>ANN ARBOR, LOWER BURNS PARK (November 17-19, 2011): There is concern among neighbors in the Lower Burns Park Neighborhood Association that the pedestrian detour signs that have been posted in the neighborhood for the Stadium Bridges project are non-standard and will be interpreted as traffic control signs for cars, not for people. Two vehicles were observed going the wrong way on Golden Avenue on Friday night, November 18.
The signs in question is similar to, but not the same as, standard MUTCD sign M4-9b.</description>
