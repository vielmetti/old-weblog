      <description>[Topix] is a web-based news aggregator and forum hosting site, based in Palo Alto, CA. They say about themselves:
 Topix is the worldâ€™s largest community news website. You can read, talk about -- and even edit -- the news on over 360,000 of our news pages. Whatever your interests are, we have a news page for you!
 Those interests can be quite wide-ranging, as seen by this discussion of where to get heroin.</description>

      <description>Anna Clark, writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, has a story about the end of AnnArbor.com and what sorts of alternatives people have when they are looking for news. I get a brief mention.
The question I want to explore is what does it mean to no longer have a single daily newspaper, or even a special daily comprehensive news web site, but instead to have a world where news about your home town is coming from lots of places.</description>

      <title>Changes at AnnArbor.com; newspaper rebrands as Ann Arbor News, shuts down website</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: I wrote for AnnArbor.com for about a year and a half, and I miss the daily morning deadlines that used to define my day. So when I heard that AnnArbor.com was shutting down its web site, moving new content to MLive, and rebranding as the Ann Arbor News, a little bit of worry was there. Would the owners scrub the site of that newspaper entirely in their quest to build something new?</description>

      <title>Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post</title>

      <description>My Twitter stream exploded with the news that Jeff Bezos of Amazon is buying the Washington Post for $250 million. This comes on the heels of the transaction that sent the Boston Globe to the owner of the Boston Red Sox for a mere $70 million. Mediagazer has perhaps the most complete collection of links about the Bezos transaction.
Why on earth would you buy a newspaper? Perhaps to make money, perhaps to spend money, perhaps to have the outsized megaphone that a news organization still offers you in this the late age of print.</description>

      <description>Failure of the fourth estate.&amp;#0160;Newspapers and websites all over the country have reported on the flooding and fire at Fort Calhoun, but most articles simply paraphrase and regurgitate information from the NRC and OPPD press releases, which aggregators and bloggers then, in turn, simply cut and paste. Even the&amp;#0160;Omaha World-Herald&amp;#0160;didn&amp;#39;t send local reporters to cover the story; instead, the newspaper published an article on the recent fire written by Associated Press reporters &amp;ndash; based in Atlanta and Washington.</description>
