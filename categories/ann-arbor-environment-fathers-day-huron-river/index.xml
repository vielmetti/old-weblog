      <description>&lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s brown and sticky? &amp;#0160;A stick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of the Huron River, strange as it may seem, is the mill race downstream of Argo Dam. &amp;#0160;It&amp;#39;s utterly unloved, used for recreation only as a canoe portage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M. and I went to the spillway that connects this mill race with the Huron, just upstream of the Detroit Edison Argo Substation. &amp;#0160;There was a lot of trash - sticks, logs, aquatic weeds of various kinds, the odd can and bottle - clogging the spillway. &amp;#0160;I brought two old cross-country ski poles, and we went stick fishing. &amp;#0160; The object is to catch a stick and then pull it so it goes over the spillway. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both ends of the ski pole are useful. &amp;#0160;The pointy end is better for poking and pulling. &amp;#0160;The grip end has a loop to secure your hand in which can be used to snag a branch. &amp;#0160;If you twist the loop you get a secure hold and can pull just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we were done stick fishing, most of the spillway was free of brush and weeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did see one couple who had caught some bluegills somewhere nearby, don&amp;#39;t know exactly where.&lt;/p&gt;
