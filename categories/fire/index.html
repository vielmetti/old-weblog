The scanner chatter includes the usual traffic reports but also the distinctive cadence of firefighting operations - calls for "Charlies" (?), water tenders, and other fire equipment, and a fire coordinator asking a crew leader what additional resources they need.

 The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The cost of the damage is unknown.

            <p>ANN ARBOR, October 7, 11:30 p.m. - A house near the corner of Harpst Street and Tremmell Avenue was on fire on the evening of October 7, 2011. This photo is provided courtesy of Mike Nowak (@snackdog) and is used with permission. The Ann Arbor Fire Department cleared the scene just after 11:00 p.m, according to radio monitoring reports.
 Enough smoke was generated by the fire that residents of the nearby Woodbury Gardens complex called for help, and trucks from Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township were seen departing the scene. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-10-07-fire-harpst/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Labor Day was a particularly bad day for fires in central Texas. If you&#39;re in that area, you may be looking for maps of where the fires are around you. Of course, you&#39;re already listening to local radio and television for news that you would need to make a decision quickly.
The Weather Underground&#39;s &quot;WunderMap&quot; product has a &quot;fire&quot; layer, which displays smoke plumes, areas that have active fires, and the perimeters of contained fires. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-09-06-central-texas-fires/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>When the Tea Fire hit Santa Barbara, California, I happened to be there at the right point to blog about it.&#0160; The latest big fire there, the Jesusita Fire, is going as of this writing, and some people are finding this blog because of searches for keywords.
As a small public service, the best one blog I&#39;d direct you to is Doc Searls weblog, because he has been doing the best blogging coverage of it and has more in depth roundup and review of the news than I would or could ever do again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-08-jesusita-fire-in-santa-barbara-ca-in-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>
