I&rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&rsquo;t have much to compare against.

        <p>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters: The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#0160;&#0160; I can&#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-30-the-business-model-is-hamsters-generating-less-money-with-each-turn-of-the-wheel/">&raquo;</a></p>
