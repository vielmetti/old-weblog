      <description>Microsoft&#39;s Outlook.com service was down for three days; here&#39;s a detailed writeup at The Next Web. A summary of sorts: &#34;The failure caused these devices to receive an error and continuously try to connect to our service. This resulted in a flood of traffic that our services did not handle properly.&#34;</description>

      <title>Learning Markdown</title>

      <description>I have a feeling that I&#39;m going to be doing a lot more writing using the Markdown language rather than using a web based rich text editor or plain HTML. Markdown is supported by Typepad, supported by Octopress (with a bunch of enhancements), supported by Github (with a few changes to be more code-friendly), supported by Vim (with colorizing of text), and supported by Leanpub (which turns them into EPUB and MOBI files).</description>

      <title>The import-export problem and fragile Internet services</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the scenario. You and your team work hard to use a new piece of collaboration software that offers some unique features that are suited either to the work at hand or that appeal to your sense of novelty. The tool works great and you get into it, using some of the more complex parts of the system to great advantage. Then the system&amp;rsquo;s owners send out the dreaded self-congratulatory message saying that they have been acquired by a big company, or some beleagured product manager announces that their system is being sunsetted.</description>

      <description>The boys got D2 pads (http://d2pad.info) for Hanukah. Here&amp;rsquo;s a 250 word long review of this 7&amp;rdquo; Android tablet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned an Android tablet of my own, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to compare against. The experience so far recommends it as a handy adjunct to a full-size computer for some tasks, and it makes me more confident in my hunch that an Android phone is going to be my next phone.</description>

      <title>&#34;The business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&#34;</title>

      <description>The phrase is from Dave Winer, noting the path of Web 2.0 company growth and the difference between what the systems are worth to the owners vs. what they are worth to the early adopters:
 The APIs are corporate APIs, the CMSes are silos, the business model is hamsters generating less money with each turn of the wheel.&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;
 I can&amp;#39;t say this is wrong, but it brings some regret for the time spent being the early hamster on the wheel and seeing whatever value I added to the likes of brand new systems being captured completely by those systems.</description>

      <description>We are writing to inform you that you have now been added to the beta for Google Analytics Real-Time! As we announced the Real-Time reports show you what is happening on your website as it happens.
 Once upon a time, there was mybloglog. It was great, and then Yahoo bought it, gave it the big purple Yahoo squeeze of love, and then killed it.
Google now has a real time version of Google Analytics, which does some of the things that mybloglog once it.</description>

      <description>Note to self: if you are going to name a new site, think about when you autocomplete it what sites you&amp;#39;re competing with for autocomplete space.&amp;#0160;

      <title>New design</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-22-new-design/</guid>
      <description>Mostly, the design is new because I was ready to scrap a bland custom design and go with something from the Typepad gallery. &amp;#0160;I also like this one in part because it has a nice wide area for pictures in blog posts.
I had to hit &amp;quot;shift-refresh&amp;quot; to force everything to load.
There&amp;#39;s something effortlessly fun in doing a redesign just by picking a selection from a menu, and suddenly having everything look new.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s characteristic of Web 2.0, it&amp;#39;s that a lot of people made it very easy to create free accounts that let you do some very small, specialized amount of publishing on their site.&amp;#0160; From recipes to wish lists to book lists to diaries to reviews, almost anything you can possibly think of writing had a home &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; on the net, as long as you were willing to have someone else&amp;#39;s advertising there sponsoring it.</description>

      <description>This blog loads very, very slowly.&amp;nbsp; (Sorry.)&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s big, it&#39;s full of weird crap that I like to post because it&#39;s interesting, and sometimes things break because the weird crap is no longer supported.
If you want it to go faster look at this:
Steve Souders book High Performance Web Sites describes the 14 best practices he developed while working as the Chief Performance Yahoo!. YSlow, the Firebug extension he created, codified those best practices.</description>

      <description>Lou Rosenfeld has a new workshop about analytics for the search within sites - the sort of information that is quantitatively and qualitatively different from general search terms and behavior because it&amp;rsquo;s within a closed domain (e.g. an intranet) or because people who are looking for something have already found you.

      <description>One of my dot-com era relics is issue #2 of the short-lived magazine In Formation. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the New York Times said about it in 1998: - the hypertext annotations are mine.  It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Howard Beale, the mad anchor in Network,&amp;rdquo; deciding he&amp;rsquo;s opposed to corporate news operations, but a group of Silicon Valley wonks has taken the daring step of going public with an equally heretical notion.</description>

      <description>from Search Engine Journal&amp;rsquo;s Loren Baker:   Among the 1,000 layoffs at Yahoo was that of Jessica Bowman, who had the dual role of Senior SEO Manager and SEO Evangelist at Yahoo, and received her pinkslip this week. As you know by now, life at Yahoo! wasn’t pleasant this week and I’m happy to report that that their in-house SEO program is now so good, that I was laid off!</description>
