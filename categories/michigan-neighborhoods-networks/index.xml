      <description>&lt;p&gt;
My cousin Zorba wrote a eulogy for my great uncle Auch, who died last week at the age of 96.  The whole thing is a bit too much to share right now, but there was one paragraph that really spoke to me about the sort of family I come from (and perhaps some insight into who I am)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his later years Auch did a lot of walking. I mean a LOT of walking, some of it right below us when the weather was bad, and I am convinced that his amblings had a lot to do with the length of his stay with us. He walked every day to the library to read the [Wall Street Journal], he walked to the stores and the bowling alley, and also, You see, on a lot of his walks, he went to sundry houses and visited the sick and the infirm- just a stop in to see how they were doing- and to cheer them up he said. Now if he was on tear about the city council, Iâ€™m not certain how cheery it was, but you get the idea. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s late now, and the weather is bad, but I&#39;m inspired to go out for a walk.
&lt;/p&gt;
