      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bunch of folks met for lunch on Thursday. Here&amp;#39;s some notes from that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked people how they stayed warm. They dress in layers, use solar thermal heating, wear sweaters, wear hats, huddle under electric blankets, and all manner of good adaptive Michigan behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some events coming up, each of which features some a2b3 group member. Some details elided in the interests of brevity, click to links for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already happened: Linda Diane Feldt spoke at Crazy Wisdom about the liver. &amp;quot;The liver is the largest and most critical organ for detoxifying the blood, moving lymph, and processing food and storing nutrients. I&amp;#39;m in awe of how well it functions, and how much it does.&amp;quot; About 18 people were at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday night 1/24/13 is David Bloom and Friends playing lounge-jazz standards at Chelsea&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Back to the Roots&amp;quot; cafe, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/188090337997019/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;details on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday 1/31/13 2-8p at Burton Manor in Livonia is ACE &amp;#39;13, the Annual Collaboration for Entrepreneurs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ace-event.org/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Details on their web site&lt;/a&gt;; volunteer opportunities are available which I&amp;#39;m happy to help you track down if you&amp;#39;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday 2/16/13 10a-noon at Eastern Accents is the 4th Death Cafe, led by Merilynne Rush. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deathcafe.com/2013/01/3rd-ann-arbor-death-cafe.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Notes on the 3d meeting are here&lt;/a&gt; with contact info and more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 2/27/13 from 7pm to 8:30pm in the Multi-Purpose Room is Dan Romanchik about how to self-publish e-books, based on his experience with writing books on amateur radio. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/events/list?id=17403&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Event details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for coming!&lt;/p&gt;
