      <description>My search logs are starting to show hits for morel season, so it&#39;s time to put this year&#39;s post together.&amp;nbsp; The early reports from the morel progression sightings map show a few isolated dots in southern Michigan, as of April 22 2009, but typically May is morel month, when and where the May apples are in good form.
Here&#39;s a list of some morel festivals in the state; if I have missed any, please let me know so that next year&#39;s list can be better.</description>

      <description>some notes for a project that my oldest is doing -
from the Michigan DNR: Landowner&amp;rsquo;s Guide, Bats
The  little brown bat is especially abundant throughout the state and is the most seen species. A light brown to dark brown in color, little browns are fairly small in size with a wingspan of 8 1&amp;frasl;2 to 11 1&amp;frasl;2 inches, small ears, and large feet. In summer, colonies of the species live in hot attics and under shingles and siding; in winter, they hibernate in caves, crevices, houses, hollow trees, or mines.</description>

      <description>reposted from the Columbia Missourian
COLUMBIA — Marie V. Scholes, a Columbia resident for 60 years, loved reading and conversation about politics and history.
“She seemed to know everything and was extremely intelligent,” said her niece, Diane Lucas. “You could have a good conversation on anything with her even if you didn’t agree. We agreed to disagree on politics.”
When Mrs. Scholes wasn’t talking about history and politics, she was reading about it.</description>
