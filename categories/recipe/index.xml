      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every technology for publishing eventually gets used to publish
recipes. This collection of mine here is not an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve marked up the recipes with the &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; category, and also
created a &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; taxonomy with ingredients. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like
a subcategory but not really&amp;hellip;well it is as long as I am careful
about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts to do this include The Usenet Cookbook (from
mod.recipes), alt.gourmand, and most favorite in my book the use
of Gopher as a cookbook. It is said that an old Mac was portable
enough to be set up in the kitchen to look up recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to do is set things up so that if the post is from the
recipes category, then the recipes list will show up in the sidebar
of that post, sorted alphabetically. I think I can make that work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some sweet potato cauliflower soup recipes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allyson Kramer likes hers with a bit of garam masala:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allysonkramer.com/2011/10/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&#34;&gt;http://www.allysonkramer.com/2011/10/sweet-potato-cauliflower-soup/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Three Peas wants carrots and celery and chicken stock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food.com and &amp;ldquo;Kelly in TO&amp;rdquo; calls for curry and cinnamon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.food.com/recipe/cauliflower-sweet-potato-curry-soup-246992&#34;&gt;http://www.food.com/recipe/cauliflower-sweet-potato-curry-soup-246992&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meal plan pairs this with biscuits and kale, and it was delicious!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac and Goat</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.com/post/Mac-and-Goat/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mac and Goat&lt;/strong&gt; calls for goat cheese; we generally use a goat gouda or
a goat cheddar, both of which are usually available at the local
Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s. Feel free to substitute any hard cheese that melts
well in your recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dish also calls for rice pasta, but again feel free to substitute;
you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for something like a rotini which handles the sauce well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Take out a lasagna pan, which is
what you&amp;rsquo;re going to assemble the dish in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mac-and-goat:b7d41359d960c78f56dcc5a9d35b0ec6&#34;&gt;Mac and Goat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 lb. pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lb. goat gouda, goat cheddar, or a nice aged gouda or cheddar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 large can crushed tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ground nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;romano cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boil water for pasta; cook a pound or so of your favorite pasta,
we use a rice rotini pasta in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shred the cheese fine in a food processor or with a hand grater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pasta is done, drain it, and then put about half of it
in the lasagna pan. Cover with about half of the cheese and half of
the tomatoes. Put the rest of the pasta in, then more tomatoes and
more cheese. Top with breadcrumbs and then sprinkle a little romano
cheese on top and a few pinches of nutmeg for flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cook 20-25 minutes, until the top is lightly browned and the
tomato sauce is bubbling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Chekov&#39;s &#34;Gooseberries&#34;</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2013/2013-07-13-from-chekovs-gooseberries/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eldritchpress.org/ac/gooseb.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Full text of Anton Chekov&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Gooseberries&amp;quot; is available at Eldritch Press.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;An excerpt from this short story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But my point does not concern him so much as myself. I want to tell you what a change took place in me in those few hours while I was in his house. In the evening, while we were having tea, the cook laid a plateful of gooseberries on the table. They had not been bought, but were his own gooseberries, plucked for the first time since the bushes were planted. Nicholai Ivanich laughed with joy and for a minute or two he looked in silence at the gooseberries with tears in his eyes. He could not speak for excitement, then put one into his mouth, glanced at me in triumph, like a child at last being given its favourite toy, and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;How good they are!&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He went on eating greedily, and saying all the while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#39;How good they are! Do try one!&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was hard and sour, but, as Poushkin said, the illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths. I saw a happy man, one whose dearest dream had come true, who had attained his goal in life, who had got what he wanted, and was pleased with his destiny and with himself....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the word &lt;a href=&#34;http://annarborchronicle.com/2013/05/23/fifth-washington-9/&#34;&gt;from Ann Arbor Chronicle contributor Linda Diane Feldt&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service berries (aka June berries) appear to be on schedule. They taste like blueberries. Very edible. They will be ripe in two to three weeks [from May 23, 2013].&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That puts a projected juneberry first picking date at about June 7, after &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/may-2013-peony-bloom-countdown-the-peony-garden-nichols-arboretum-ann-arbor.html&#34;&gt;the peonies start&lt;/a&gt; but before &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/05/strawberry-season-is-coming-for-2013-some-first-harvest-estimates.html&#34;&gt;the u-pick strawberries are ready&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>semolina pudding</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2003/2003-01-26-semolina-pudding/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.com/post/2003/2003-01-26-semolina-pudding/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;January 26, 2003&lt;br /&gt;
SEMOLINA PUDDING&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 cups water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grated peel of 1 lemon (pref. organic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 cup semolina flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;raspberries or other berries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directions:
Mix sugar, milk, water and lemon peel in a pot or big saucepan. Heat until just about to boil, then gradually sprinkle in semolina flour, whisking the whole time to prevent lumps from forming. Allow mixture to thicken considerably. Remove from heat and pour into bowl, mold, or cupcake pan. Refrigerate for at least two hours. Pudding should be somewhat firmer than chocolate pudding, but less firm than jello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ready to serve, unmold pudding or leave in bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon. Top with raspberries or other fruit. Sugared raspberries are particularly nice when a little bit of sauce is formed and can be poured over the pudding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pudding has a texture that is somehow both agreeably grainy and smooth and is very cooling in the summertime. You can vary the milk:water ratio in the recipe, even to the point of omitting one or the other entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(thanks to puddingmeister Deb for the recipe)&lt;/p&gt;
