      <description>This weblog, which may or may not ever see the light of day, is about a great many things.
There are other blogs waiting to be written that don&amp;rsquo;t have that infinite vista; they could easily be much more narrow. What, then, do you write about? Let&amp;rsquo;s count some of the options.
 Docker on the Raspberry Pi, following Hypriot&amp;rsquo;s lead. Just Docker in general, and Dockerizing various things. Recipes, since I have a bunch already.</description>

      <title>The next major change for this weblog is converting over comments to Disqus</title>

      <description>I&#39;m not ready to take it on yet, but my next plan here is to port the 2000+ comments that I have on this blog over to Disqus, and start using that instead of Typepad Comments. Expect that to happen in the next month or so. I think all I need is a practice session on a small blog to make sure I get the steps right, and a fast network connection to make sure the switch happens quickly when I upload the new comment stream into Disqus.</description>

      <title>A new responsive design for this weblog</title>

      <description>Thanks to the good folks at Typepad, I now have a responsive design for this blog. Their new &#34;Snap&#34; theme gives you one design that works well on devices of various sizes. I&#39;m liking it so far.
The one thing that I want to tweak is the design of the &#34;blockquote&#34; font size and weight:
 Blockquote is here in bold, whereas I&#39;d prefer to make it quite a bit less bold since I don&#39;t use it so much.</description>

      <description>I treat this weblog as an unpolished open notebook, inspired by RFC 3 from 1969:
Steve Crocker,&amp;#0160;Internet Request for Comments 3, from 1969: &amp;quot;There is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.&amp;quot;
If you are looking for some more evidence of focus and polish, I&amp;#39;ve moved some of the writing that I&amp;#39;ve done on some topics to their own weblogs. See these:
 Blogger&amp;#39;s Secret, a sporadically active weblog about writing and expertise FOIA Coordinator, a weekly weblog about the Freedom of Information Act Superpatron, a mostly dormant but still interesting blog about libraries and books A Pinterest board for maps, which sometimes show up in this blog&amp;#39;s maps category  Looking forward to hearing from you.</description>

      <description>For this blog, at least, I want to make it very clear: I&#39;m not &#34;producing content&#34;, I&#39;m writing. This may be in order to call out attention to the work of a friend or a client, it may be to scratch some particular itch for words that need to be said, and it may be because someone else&#39;s interests dovetail with mine. Generally I try to quote enough of what other people say to be fair to them, and to tell a part of a story that you can find only by chasing through the network looking to connect ideas together at their edges.</description>

      <description>This is the weblog of Edward Vielmetti in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It&amp;#39;s part of a continuous stream of writing online that started for the Internet in 1985, and that showed up here on Typepad in 2003 or so.
I have been interested in a great many things, which all have had something to do one way or the other with networks and internetworks at all levels - technical, political, social, biological, intellectual and commercial.</description>
