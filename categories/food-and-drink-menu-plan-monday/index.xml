      <description>&lt;p&gt;This recipe is good for those days when you have dinner that might be postponed for a long time. The curry can be served quickly, but if you leave it on the stove longer the potatoes turn into a kind of delicious curry gravy for the garbanzos. We served it with greens, and it would have been good with a side of cauliflower as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coconut-potato curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 lbs potatoes, boiled, with 1 cup cooking water reserved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 onion, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil for frying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curry powder, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 can coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cans garbanzo beans, cooked and drained and rinsed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare potatoes by boiling them until done. Reserve some cooking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the potatoes are boiling, fry a chopped onion in some oil on low heat. When the onion smells nice but is not brown, add the curry powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the coconut milk to the curry mixture and stir until well mixed. Then add the garbanzoes, and cook covered on low heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the potatoes are ready, add them to the garbanzo curry. Cut the potatoes into smaller pieces if they are too large. Keep covered, and add up to 1 cup potato water if the mixture gets too dry.&lt;/p&gt;
