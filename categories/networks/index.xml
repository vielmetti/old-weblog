      <description>In his An internet x-ray machine for the masses, Paul Ohm writes a lucid introduction to mitmproxy, a man-in-the-middle proxy server that allows you to get between your browser and the Internet and poke at (and change) the traffic going between the two.
http://mitmproxy.org is the home of mitmproxy. It&amp;rsquo;s the work of Aldo Cortesi and a cast of hundreds of contributors on github at https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy . I used the OS X binary distribution from the download page.</description>

      <description>Lior Zoref has a new book out called Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything (Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the new shelf at Mallett&amp;rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday afternoon. Mallett&amp;rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot to be on a warm day.
 The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits without repeating the author&amp;rsquo;s technique of using the word &amp;ldquo;Mindsharing&amp;rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity.</description>

      <description>On the morning of 27 January 2014, AT&amp;amp;T UVerse services appear to be suffering from DNS problems. A graph from Down Detector suggests that the problem is widespread. The observation is that some sites will load but others won&#39;t (like Hulu, New Yorker, Reddit.)

One of the suggestions given was to switch your DNS from the AT&amp;amp;T provided service to a third party, such as Google (8.8.8.8). On my Mac, go to System Preferences  Network  Advanced .</description>

      <description>Several reasons why I am removing the Facebook from my phone.
Taking it off the screen will reduce my time on site, leaving more room for the rest of the net and the rest of the world.
If I need to write something short there is always Twitter. If I need to write something long there is Evernote for notes to self and this blog for notes to the world.</description>

      <description>The telegraphy system in India is coming to an end in July 2013, reports The Christian Science Monitor:
 At the&amp;#0160;Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited&amp;#0160;(BSNL),&amp;#0160;India&amp;#39;s state-owned telecom company, a message emerges from a dot matrix printer addressing a soldier&amp;#39;s Army unit in&amp;#0160;Delhi.&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;GRANDMOTHER SERIOUS. 15 DAYS LEAVE EXTENSION,&amp;quot; it reads. It&amp;#39;s one of about 5,000 such missives still being sent every day by telegram – a format favored for its &amp;quot;sense of urgency and authenticity,&amp;quot; explains a BSNL official.</description>

      <description>This map, compiled from traffic to this weblog, paints an approximate picture of the distribution of problems from today&amp;#39;s Windstream outage. More official news (though sparse) is at the news.windstream.com site.

In the news:
From the WindstreamCommunications page on Facebook, about 4 p.m:

      <description>My Twitter feed is full of worry about the changes to the Twitter API. (Yes, that probably means I should unfollow a few people so that it gets back to the baseline of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m eating a sandwich&amp;quot;.) Here&amp;#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.
From Marco Arment, creator of Instapaper, &amp;quot;Interpreting some of Twitter&amp;#39;s API changes&amp;quot; is a good overview of the challenges for a developer to comply with new rules while still innovating on their core application.</description>

 &amp;quot;A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn&amp;#39;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.&amp;quot; Leslie Lamport, 1987; though the same observation would be true for cloud computing today.  &amp;#0160;
Noted recently on this Google Plus thread; I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll quote the whole thing, but by referencing it here I&amp;#39;ll find it again at least for a while.</description>

Image credit: Arbor Networks.
From the Renesys blog, &amp;quot;Egypt leaves the Internet&amp;quot;
 At 22:34 UTC (00:34am local time), Renesys observed the virtually simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the Internet&amp;#39;s global routing table. Approximately 3,500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn, leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange Internet traffic with Egypt&amp;#39;s service providers. Virtually all of Egypt&amp;#39;s Internet addresses are now unreachable, worldwide.</description>

      <description>I put up a little project on github last night, twitter mutual friends.&amp;#0160; This is the page that should serve as the reference point for it.
I started up the effort while trying to make sense of the &amp;quot;follow or don&amp;#39;t follow&amp;quot; decision when someone follows you.&amp;#0160; Certainly following everyone blindly is a bad mistake, but ignoring new followers is a bad mistake too, and sometimes you just need to prune back the following stream to leave room for new voices.</description>

      <description>DTE Energy is Detroit Edison + Michigan Consolidated Gas.
 This is a clipping from the DTE power outage map pulled at 11:15pm on Saturday, 25 April 2009.&amp;#0160; If you have a network connection, you can get your own copy (as a PDF) from their web site.&amp;#0160; The color coding at a glance is simple: outage intensity goes pale blue, pale yellow, bright pink, bright orane, and angry red.&amp;#0160; No angry red on this map.</description>

      <description>noted on Geert&amp;#39;s blog
IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network!
Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friends’ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)!</description>

      <description>As found on the LG&amp;amp;E storm info page
Dated 1/28/2009, 4pm; the image itself does not have any watermarks, copyrights, or other credits, so any conclusions you draw will be your own.&amp;#0160; It does clearly show the extent of the storm, though I don&amp;#39;t know if the no-damage areas are outside of this power company&amp;#39;s service area or if they are really undamaged.

Here, then, are some of the fundamentals of professional networking. They will sound cumbersome and abstract. You will be able to skip some of the steps as you get established in your field, but if you are starting from zero then the process really is quite complicated.</description>

      <description>It was a dark and stormy night.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, the power went out.
The biggest effect: 210,000 DTE customers all over SE Michigan went dark.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s a piece of the map to give you an idea - click through for current map.
The best DTE site for updates seems to be mobile.dteenergy.com, as much as there is a &#34;best&#34;.
 The biggest side effect of this was an outage of the AT&amp;amp;T mobile network and as a result the iPhone network.</description>

      <description>LONG-LOST OPERATIC FRAGMENT COMES TO LIGHT
 During the golden years of the Opera in Michigan, many of the great composers and librettists wandered through the glittering capital of the Midwestern risorgimento. Strangely, little of their output has been preserved, but recently, this fragment of the libretto from an unfinished work by the immortal Giuseppe Verde came to light, hidden behind a huge nude painting at the Odd Town Tavern. Wood-Charles is proud to bring to the music community even this crumbling shard of Verde&amp;#39;s never-performed Il Internetto.</description>

more about the speaker: an old home page at Yale; he&amp;#39;s ex Yahoo research; his current home page at Stanford.&amp;#0160; He has published a paper at arXiv that covers this material.&amp;#0160; A pull quote from that paper is:

      <description>In recent days a number of modestly successful online social and productivity services have been scheduled for decommisioning. Pownce is being turned off as that team moves to Six Apart, and I Want Sandy is going away as Rael moves to Twitter. You will see more systems get acquired and shut down with graceful exits, and some exits will not be so graceful.
There seem to be multiple common reasons why upstart systems get wiped out in times of economic crisis.</description>

      <description>Achieving Extraordinary Organizational Performance Through Diversity
Professor Scott Page, University of Michigan
Friday, November 21, 1-2:15 p.m.
Founders Room, Alumni Center
200 Fletcher
Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? How does diversity improve an organization&amp;#39;s predictions, decisions, and problem-solving capabilities? Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, Scott Page discusses why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you&amp;#39;re talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory, and why diversity trumps ability.</description>

      <description>Just how good do you have to be in direct marketing to have a successful campaign when all of your messages are being delivered as spam?

 Researchers Hijack Storm Worm to Track Profits
A single response from 12 million e-mails is all it takes for spammers to turn annual profits of millions of dollars promoting knockoff pharmaceuticals, according to an unprecedented new study on the economics of spam.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I love Twitter - I love being in the flow of the world with the off hand comments of hundreds of friends around the world triggering all sorts of warm feelings and thoughts about how lucky I am to know so many people in so many places.
For that very same reason, I&amp;#39;m working towards getting off Twitter, my &amp;quot;twitter zero&amp;quot; project, where I unfollow everyone I&amp;#39;ve been following.</description>

      <description>A follow up on the earlier post about the commercialization of the internet -
Once the basic data infrastructure of the Internet was open to commercial use - which starts in late 1991, and accelerates rapidly from there - you start to get slowly and then at a rapidly accelerating pace the appearance of businesses online who are selling things to people directly.
Some milestones there as well:
1993: Fry Multimedia launches web sites for Godiva, Ragu; mostly marketing and advertising not sales.</description>

      <description>#gno stands for &amp;quot;Girl&#39;s Night Out&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s trending right now on search.twitter.com.&amp;nbsp; (Yes I am up late; but this is fascinating, I&#39;ve never seen this particular behavior on twitter before.)
Sometimes you&#39;ll see topics trend on search.twitter.com when there are a lot of hipster people in some hipster city at some hipster tech conference.&amp;nbsp; A zillion people who are all mostly in the same building will use the same tag to post comments on the event.</description>

      <description>A friend asks, &amp;quot;when did the Internet go commercial&amp;quot;?&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s something of a timeline, incomplete, but footnoted as best I can.
1987: UUNET launches as a non-profit providing Usenet feeds
1989: Software Tool and Die in Boston, MA goes online as the first commercial Internet service provider.
1990: UUNET, now for profit, launches Alternet, an IP network that accepts commercial traffic.
1991: August, the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) connects CERFnet, PSInet, and Alternet</description>

      <title>relevance in social networks - a function of local density</title>

      <description>This very interesting phrase gets exactly one search hit in Google, a use in the book &amp;ldquo;Network Analysis: Methodological Foundations&amp;rdquo; by Ulrik Brandes, Thomas Erlebach.
I&amp;rsquo;m getting my copy via inter-library loan (yay Melcat) and hope to dig through it. The relevant chapter is on &amp;ldquo;local density&amp;rdquo;, which looks to have all kinds of NP-hard math about finding dense clusters, cliques, and inside networks.
What makes a portion of a social network more relevant than the rest of it?</description>

      <description>I was at the NSFNET 20th reunion last week. Here&#39;s some notes after the fact.  I took good notes on URLs mentioned on delicious - look at http://del.icio.us/vielmetti/nsfnet to get the running commentary as I was trying to do it.  History is written by the winners, and thus the NSFNET history was written by the winners - the winners of the 1987 contract to manage it (Merit, MCI and IBM), and those who personally or corporately won out when the backbone was transformed from a research and educational network into a commercial one.</description>
