Mallett&rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot to be on a warm day.

Here&#39;s some of the notable problems that people see with the new rules, which are going into effect over the next 6 months.

        <p>noted on Geert&#39;s blog IP over Social Network is a Facebook application which allows any Facebook member to create its own IPv6 virtual router for free and build an IPv6 network over the Facebook Social Network! Once you have created your virtual router by installing this free application, you can then add up to 12 interfaces (i.e. links) connected to your other friendsâ€™ routers. IPv6 packets can then be exchanged over those links and of course, like in all IP networks, can be routed to any destination over the network (including a special gateway to the IPv6 Internet of course)! <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-03-03-ipv6-over-social-network-a-facebook-application-for-routing-packets-over-friend-networks/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A few weeks ago I zeroed out my Twitter follower stream and stopped following everyone.&#0160; (&quot;Twitter zero&quot;, October 2008) Then I started again, slowly, building up some carefully selected and ever changing list of people to watch.&#0160; It seemed like a good plan, Dunbar number and everything, and I thought I could balance things out at about 150.&#0160; The amount of brain power needed to figure out whether I was watching someone got to be out of control, and Twitter got to be a burden again.&#0160; Less of a burden than the accumulated drag of other systems that I had given up on but that still had remnant shards of a previous me, but still a burden. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-12-23-how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-twitter/">&raquo;</a></p>
