      <description>Every year on Earth Day I do a ritual weeding of our back yard garden and pick whatever garlic mustard I can find. We&amp;#39;ve been thinning out the garlic mustard every year for years and so it&amp;#39;s mostly in check but it&amp;#39;s always worth pulling a few more plants.
Aside from putting the garlic mustard in the municipal compost - not your own compost - there&amp;#39;s always a temptation to eat at least some of what gets pulled.</description>

      <description>Note to self: the first big garlic mustard pull of the season is in the planter in front of Caribou Coffee on Packard and Stadium, so that the flowers don&amp;#39;t get totally choked out and so that spot doesn&amp;#39;t seed the whole neighborhood.</description>

      <description>Garlic Mustard in Michigan, a report and information from Michigan State University:  Garlic mustard is an exotic invasive plant from Europe that invades woodland habitats in North America and impacts forest biodiversity. In some woodlands, dense stands of garlic mustard in the spring threaten showy spring blooming ephemerals like spring beauty, trilliums and trout lilies. Other research points toward potentially negative impacts on timber species and forest health. Many land managers consider it to be one of the most potentially harmful and difficult to control invasive plants in the region.</description>
