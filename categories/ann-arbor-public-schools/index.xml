      <description>Note: this is part of the discussion at the Ann Arbor School Board meeting of June 10, 2015. You can see a full live blog of the meeting at Ann Arbivore which is written by former Ann Arbor Chronicle writer Monet Tiedemann.
DRAFT POLICY 5060 - STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN ASSESSMENT PROGRAMS
The Board of Education believes that assessing student progress provides important data by which the district can measure the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction and the impact of our educational programs on student achievement.</description>

      <description>This letter went out Friday night, but there was no discussion or announcement on the a2schools.org official school website as late as early Monday morning. I first saw the full text of this letter on the excellent Ann Arbor Schools Musings weblog where there&#39;s a good discussion.
 Dear Pioneer Families, I have notified the Pioneer community today that Ms. Cindy Leaman has agreed to serve as Principal of Ann Arbor&#39;s A2 Virtual+ Academy beginning January 6, 2014.</description>

      <title>Former Ann Arbor Public Schools principal accused of plagiarism</title>

      <description>I&#39;ll start with a confession: I don&#39;t think that plagiarism is as big a deal as some people do, especially when you are recycling your own words. (&#34;Self-plagiarism is style.&#34;) The best writers have a set of phrases that they love to use, and it&#39;s not unusual for them to pull something they&#39;ve done before and rework it a bit to suit the new occasion. This is especially true when you&#39;re writing formulaic work that&#39;s short.</description>

Ruth from A2 Schools Muse has insightful commentary.
April 11, 2013
Dear Colleagues and AAPS Families: Last evening, I gave President Deb Mexicotte a letter in which I asked her to accept my resignation as Superintendent of Schools of the Ann Arbor Public Schools, effective 90 days from yesterday.</description>

      <description>My Facebook stream is full of pictures of kids on their first day of school. (That&amp;#39;s great!) Sorry that I don&amp;#39;t have a first day, or even a second day, photo to share.
The second day at our house featured a last-minute lunch prep (mac and cheese) and then two bicycle rides, one each for the 7th grader and for the 2d grader. The Burns Park school grounds were busy with a stream of parents and kids coming for dropoff; I haven&amp;#39;t seen the new Summers-Knoll morning rush yet.</description>

      <description>We got word via telephone this morning before school started that a power outage at Burns Park Elementary School (see map below, from the DTE outage map) has cancelled school for the day. The outage affects over 1400 customers in Burns Park, Lower Burns Park, and along South State Street. I can&#39;t tell from the map whether University of Michigan facilities are also affected, but the report from the dotcom is that traffic signals are also affected along Packard and on East Stadium near the Stadium Bridges project.</description>

      <title>Lightning damage closes Ann Arbor Northside Elementary School on May 26, no one injured</title>

      <description>Lightning hit a brick chimney at Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s Northside Elementary School on Wednesday at about 4:15 p.m., sending bricks flying 100 feet through the school pickup area. Fortunately, no one was hurt, as the area was vacant except for a staff member&amp;#39;s vehicle which was damaged by flying brick.
I was aware of this when it happened because the lightning strike was powerful enough to cause the power grid to bounce, prompting comments on Twitter and speculating on the exact location.</description>

      <title>Burns Park Elementary School calendar and lost and found</title>

      <description>A convenient calendar for the end of the school year, which is to say that I&amp;rsquo;m doing this for next year.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a point when I visit the school to pick up or drop off J. to make a pass past the lost and found and put anything on a hanger that could possibly go onto a hanger. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know if that makes an immediate difference, but it&amp;rsquo;s satisfying to find a 5 minute volunteer opportunity that I can see.</description>

      <description>Ruth is writing about the Ann Arbor Public Schools in a new blog Ann Arbor Schools Musings. 
Her introductory post spells out the reasons for blogging about school:
Sometimes I find the schools satisfactory, and sometimes not, but in general I have a lot of questions. Questions about why things run the way they do. Questions about whether things could run better. Critiques about the schools. Ideas to improve them.</description>
