      <description>I&#39;m hanging out at Roos Roast with photojournalist Mark Bialek, who is doing a photo shoot for them. Mark is known for his night time photos of Ann Arbor on his Ann Arbor Nights weblog. We&#39;re talking about working together in some way to have some of his photos show up here on this weblog. As a start, here&#39;s one of his favorites: a night time winter scene from Kerrytown.</description>

      <description>The site loads slowly, the photos are all squished together, and the carefully curated metadata and tags and comments and photo names are de-emphasized. It&amp;#39;s like a weird mix of Pinterest and Tumblr.
I&amp;#39;m hoping for a classic.flickr.com to preserve the old UI, in the same way that old-school Weather Underground users can use classic.wunderground.com to see things the way they were meant to be.
If I had the time, I&amp;#39;d cherry pick the best photos from my Flickr stream and blog about them here.</description>
