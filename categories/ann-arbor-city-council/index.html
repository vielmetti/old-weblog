Four very brief topics: municipal maps, public records, closed captioning and the city web site. These are my intended comments at the end of the meeting.
Regarding municipal maps, I would point out that any of the maps generated by the city in your packet have a very strict copyright on them prohibiting redistribution without the express written consent of the city. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-02-comments-as-presented-to-the-ann-arbor-city-council-municipal-maps-public-records-closed-captioning-/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council's amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.
More details Tuesday as stories come in from local media outlets. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-03-hieftje-veto-preserves-crosswalk-law/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A preview of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting for Monday, December 2, 2013; based on the agenda printed on Friday, November 29, 2013 at 6:00 p.m.
The hot issue for December 2, 2013 is the proposed repeal of the Ann Arbor pedestrian ordinance. If passed, city rules for pedestrians would revert to the Michigan state laws.
Another preview, with a lot more words, is at the Ann Arbor Chronicle. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-29-ann-arbor-city-council-preview-for-december-2-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The meeting agenda for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it's time to do a preview.
As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the Ann Arbor Chronicle preview. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this Ann Arbor News story.

Note that the agenda is subject to change up until the very last minute, though in general it stabilizes well before that.
The Ann Arbor Chronicle preview is well worth a read.
The agenda, in order, noting only interesting items. Your idea of what is interesting may differ. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-01-ann-arbor-city-council-preview-for-thursday-7-november-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As sent to the Ann Arbor City Clerk, 23 October 2013:
To the clerk:
The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to spend money to replace them.
To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at council about the state of the lighting, I'd like to make this request. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-23-foia-inspection-reports-for-downtown-ann-arbor-street-lights/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Some stories that I'm watching about what's on the Ann Arbor City Council agenda for 21 October 2013.

As usual, the Ann Arbor Chronicle preview is a useful guide to the details, and the meeting details from Legistar give you the play-by-play.
The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site. Keystone won the RFP, beating out Flight Plan Creative of Traverse City ($24,650) and B+B Marketing Communications of Midland ($40,000). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-20-ann-arbor-city-council-preview-for-the-meeting-of-monday-21-october-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.
Council discussed the situation in Portland, Oregon. Consumerist notes that parents there are recycling their dirty poopy diapers. (ew.)
 “It started when the city went to every other week garbage pickup,” the president of Far West Fibers, which handles much of the curbside recycling for Portland, tells Oregon Public Broadcasting. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-10-07-ann-arbor-city-council-considers-and-declines-to-study-biweekly-trash-pickup/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.
The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-09-city-council-report-august-8-2013/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>As reviewed on Wikipedia -
 These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&#0160;perceived&#0160;as two different cities.
 The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-07-15-when-i-hear-a2council-talking-about-the-city-and-the-university-i-think-about-china-mievilles-the-ci/">&raquo;</a></p>

 A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers.
  An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-16-ann-arbor-city-council-to-consider-restricting-public-comment-time/">&raquo;</a></p>

The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&#39;t agree with.
