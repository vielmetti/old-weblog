      <description>Comments as presented to the Ann Arbor City Council for the September 2, 2014 meeting.
Four very brief topics: municipal maps, public records, closed captioning and the city web site. These are my intended comments at the end of the meeting.
Regarding municipal maps, I would point out that any of the maps generated by the city in your packet have a very strict copyright on them prohibiting redistribution without the express written consent of the city.</description>

      <description>ANN ARBOR - Mayor John Hieftje promised Monday night to exercise his mayoral veto powers to squash City Council&#39;s amendments to the city crosswalk law, which passed 6-4. The veto will mean that the crosswalk law will be unchanged. 36 people spoke up at a public hearing in favor of the law as written, with only 3 speaking in favor of a change.
More details Tuesday as stories come in from local media outlets.</description>

      <description>A preview of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting for Monday, December 2, 2013; based on the agenda printed on Friday, November 29, 2013 at 6:00 p.m.
The hot issue for December 2, 2013 is the proposed repeal of the Ann Arbor pedestrian ordinance. If passed, city rules for pedestrians would revert to the Michigan state laws.
Another preview, with a lot more words, is at the Ann Arbor Chronicle.</description>

      <description>The meeting agenda for Ann Arbor City Council is up for the Monday, 18 November 2013 meeting. That means it&#39;s time to do a preview.
As usual this is done strictly in the order of the agenda, with item numbers. For a longer and more thematic look, I recommend the Ann Arbor Chronicle preview. For a preview of the pedestrian safety ordinance discussion, see this Ann Arbor News story.
UPDATE: as of 4:40 p.</description>

      <description>Because of the election on Tuesday 5 November 2013, the Ann Arbor City Council will be meeting on Thursday 7 November 2013. Here&#39;s a preview of sorts of the agenda. Note that the agenda is subject to change up until the very last minute, though in general it stabilizes well before that.
The Ann Arbor Chronicle preview is well worth a read.
The agenda, in order, noting only interesting items. Your idea of what is interesting may differ.</description>

      <description>The Twenty Pound Carp is mounting a quixotic write-in campaign for Ann Arbor City Council in Ward 4, as evidenced by this campaign sign. It faces Democratic candidate Jack Eaton in the November 5, 2013 general election.
Even now political operative are fanning out across the 4th Ward and planting signs--signs of political change, yo. pic.twitter.com/qaC3Gxlnbw
&amp;mdash; Twenty Pound Carp (@TwentyPoundCarp) October 28, 2013 
The back story on this is hard to describe, but suffice it to say that when a bottom feeder takes interest in a political campaign, all bets are off.</description>

      <description>As sent to the Ann Arbor City Clerk, 23 October 2013:
To the clerk:
The City Council meeting of this week Tuesday (ed.: actually late Monday) had an extended discussion of street lighting in the downtown area, and council weighed the problems with rust on street lamps and decided not to spend money to replace them.
To follow up on this discussion, and motivated by the uncertainty at council about the state of the lighting, I&#39;d like to make this request.</description>

      <description>Some stories that I&#39;m watching about what&#39;s on the Ann Arbor City Council agenda for 21 October 2013.

As usual, the Ann Arbor Chronicle preview is a useful guide to the details, and the meeting details from Legistar give you the play-by-play.
The consent agenda includes a $26,900.00 project from Keystone Media of Ann Arbor to redesign the city web site. Keystone won the RFP, beating out Flight Plan Creative of Traverse City ($24,650) and B+B Marketing Communications of Midland ($40,000).</description>

      <description>The Ann Arbor City Council decided not to study biweekly trash pickup as a part of its new solid waste plan at its meeting of 7 October 2013.
Council discussed the situation in Portland, Oregon. Consumerist notes that parents there are recycling their dirty poopy diapers. (ew.)
 “It started when the city went to every other week garbage pickup,” the president of Far West Fibers, which handles much of the curbside recycling for Portland, tells Oregon Public Broadcasting.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s on the agenda for the 7 October 2013 Ann Arbor City Council meeting?

      <description>It was a relatively early end to city council. No controversial public hearings meant that public comment was small. To make up for it council had an extended discussion of a sidewalk crossing near a school that should have been simple and uncontroversial but ended up being an elaborate parade of city staff talking about a few feet of blacktop.
The most interesting part of the night was an account of the party for one of the unsuccessful council candidates.</description>

      <description>As reviewed on Wikipedia -
 These two cities actually occupy much of the same geographical space, but via the volition of their citizens (and the threat of the secret power known as Breach), they are&amp;#0160;perceived&amp;#0160;as two different cities.
 The two cities are the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor; both treat themselves as sovereign nations as best they can, and though the freeway ring mostly encircles both they are distinguished by having separate police forces, separate budgets, separate public green space and separate social circles and hierarchies.</description>

      <description>As reported in the Ann Arbor Chronicle:
 A June 13, 2013 meeting of the Ann Arbor city council’s rules committee has resulted in proposed revisions to the council’s rules, many of which affect speaking turns and time – for members of the public and for councilmembers.
  An across-the-board proposed change for city council meeting public speaking times is a reduction from three minutes to two minutes for each turn.</description>

      <description>The web site is http://higginsforcouncil.com . It was once a campaign website; it&amp;#39;s now an anti-campaign site, with the (anonymous) person hosting it heaping invective and scorn upon a local politician.
If you&amp;#39;re running for office and have a web site set up to support your campaign, use some of your campaign money to buy a domain registration that lasts a long time. You&amp;#39;ll avoid problems like this in the future.</description>

      <description>In our fair city there are a number of people who keep track of what&amp;#39;s going on at city council, and some of those folks use Twitter to follow along with that&amp;#39;s going on in real time. This is helped by the live simulcast of Ann Arbor City Council meetings on CTN, the city&amp;#39;s cable access television feed, as well as online.
There is a lot to follow here, with the ins and outs of multi-year development projects being discussed and proposed and a cast of regular characters giving public commentary.</description>

      <description>David Bloom holds forth in song in Off I Go To The County Board, one of the few songs written about the process of covering public meetings.
Off I Go To The County Board,
inspired by Mary Morgan
Off I Go To The County Board,
To hear the rabble bray,
Of taxes met, infractions scored,
On this harumphing day.
 Oh Washtenaw, brave Washtenaw,
Of eighty-three, the best.
The other counties hold in awe,</description>

      <description>The City of Ann Arbor has dozens of citizen boards and commissions, with members appointed by the mayor, that conduct some of the decision making parts of city government. Most of these boards toil in utter obscurity, with no one in attendance at meetings other than the minimum required board members and staff.
Despite (or perhaps because of) this obscurity, there are some interesting things to be discovered by reading board minutes and board packets from these groups.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s an overly simplified description of the process by which you can learn about, and participate in, more public meetings on more topics of public interest than you could possibly attend in person - without ever relying on someone else&amp;#39;s account of what transpired at that meeting.
&amp;#0160;
Identify the public body which has oversight or jurisdiction over the issue in question. There may be multiples of these, at the local, county, state and federal levels, plus occasionally a treaty organization or two that gets involved.</description>

      <description>I continue to be utterly baffled by the way politics works in this town.
The latest comes from documents obtained by FOIA of emails sent among members of city council during the council public meetings.&amp;#0160; These messages provide council members with a sub rosa back channel to discuss items on the public agenda and evidently to tease (or ridicule) members of council that they don&amp;#39;t agree with.

      <description>If you are studying semiotics, you need to go no further than chapter 61 of the City of Ann Arbor code, covering signs and outdoor advertising. 
(a)&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;Gasoline Price Signs.&amp;#0160; A gasoline service station shall be permitted signs on each pump island indicating the prices and types of gasoline and the type of service. The area of such signs shall not exceed 20 square feet per pump island.&amp;#0160;</description>

      <description>Previously: Paper, plastic or burlap (2008)
The Ann Arbor City Council has decided to postpone a vote on a ban on plastic bags. As noted in the Ann Arbor News prior to the city council event:
There&amp;#39;s still more of that work to be done, said City Council Member Stephen Rapundalo, who&amp;#39;s among the promoters of the ban. Because the council had voted to postpone any action on the issue for six months, a vote has been scheduled on Monday to extend that period, Rapundalo said.</description>
