            <p>GriefNet&#0160;is an Internet community approach to on line grief support, providing support to people working through loss and grief issues of all kinds. Cendra Lynn is the leader of the organization, and I had some small technological part in starting it back in 1993 when the appropriate technology of the day was Gopher, not the World Wide Web. The system hosts dozens of moderated mailing lists for people who share a common loss like the death of a spouse or the loss of a child. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-griefnet-support-for-grief-death-and-major-loss/">&raquo;</a></p>

Thinking about collaboration and community leadership, since it seems to be something that I do.
The examples that come to mind share some common traits.
 there is a mix of online and in person communications, and not solely one or the other for routine everyday communications you use whatever everyone is using in your field; be that email or facebook or twitter or phone or sms, you adapt to the existing norms to start at least. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-12-collaboration-and-community-leadership/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Aardvark is vark.com - as of February 2010 they are owned by the Google. &#0160;It&#39;s part of a genre of question asking sites where the answer comes back partly from &quot;your network&quot; and partly from the random parts of the net that you don&#39;t know very much about. If you think you have an interesting question, you can ask it on Aardvark and see what you get. &#0160;My practice efforts have been pretty dismal, but I might be asking for things outside of what it&#39;s capable of doing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-13-practicing-questions-with-aardvark/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Metblogs was a national network of local blogs. The idea was that in each of many metro regions, someone or some set of people would be recruited to write local content, largely for free. The whole network would be run on advertising revenue, and user generated content would fill pages with fresh, relevant, hyperlocal content.
From Metblogs series finale:
[U]ltimately the downturns in advertising and dwindling interest in blogs in favor of social networks and twitter have made the business unsustainable and we’re closing the doors at the end of May. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-05-23-the-end-of-metblogs/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Quite a few cafe networks have filters set up to block various kinds of use.&#0160; My usual failure modes with these are that they mark perfectly reasonable internet services as inappropriate.
Here&#39;s a litany of Panera complaints, to give you a feel for it.
Tinotopia was blocked for a while, which got the author riled up enough to document some of the failures.&#0160; No entries since April 2005:
In this case, Tino of all people is the loser: for he has once again been suckered into coming into Panera only to find that the network is kaput. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-11-10-great-wall-of-panera-what-do-corporate-cafe-wifi-networks-block/">&raquo;</a></p>

Now you can report power outages on line using a mobile device.
Just go to mobile.dteenergy.com with your web-based cell phone or PDA. In moments you can report an outage or get a repair estimate on a previously reported outage.

This is reporting only, not mapping, and the mobile interface has the most pessimistic assumptions about mobile phone capacity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-06-12-dte-energy-the/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The Marquette Mining Journal recently ran this editorial regarding taking interactive comments off of the internet version of their newspaper, reading in part:  The comments were posted, without prior screening, in order to make it as easy as possible for Journal readers to submit their input directly. Unfortunately, a handful of participants abused the system. While most comments were astute and relevant, some relentless individuals decided to turn the comments section into a chat room that ventured, frankly, into the realm of inappropriate, sophomoric idiocy. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-03-23-marquette-minin/">&raquo;</a></p>

Yahoo has a staggering 500 million users. However, it does a rather poor job of monetization. The vision that Yang shared at CES last week (“At Yahoo we want to be the most essential starting point for your life”) can come true if the key activities that we perform online are channeled through its My Yahoo service. And on the financial side, each of those activities needs to be backed up by a monetization model that takes full advantage of the traffic that Yahoo consistently manages to generate and preserve. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-01-22-yahoo-leadershi/">&raquo;</a></p>

Generally, the categories are described as &ldquo;light snow,&rdquo; &ldquo;snow emergency.&rdquo; In addition, the city is dependent upon its citizens for sidewalk snow removal.

The folks on my block regularly borrow ladders, save up canning jars, pick each others surplus tomatoes, take care of cats etc as needed. Sometimes token amounts of cash change hands - mostly to pay kids - but often not.
 I look at the kinds of businesses and business plans aimed at monetizing neighborliness with a bit of skepticism. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2007/2007-12-02-neighborhood-re/">&raquo;</a></p>
