      <description>&lt;p&gt;Discardia is a quarterly holiday that helps you get rid of things. This year&#39;s fall season dates are September 22 (the equinox) to September 23 (the new moon), 2014. I&#39;m looking forward at the very least to a cleanout of the basement, which as my son points out is full of &#39;crap from the 1990s&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.discardia.com&#34;&gt;www.discardia.com&lt;/a&gt; for details; the origin of the event is due to Dinah Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Forgetting as a feature, not a bug&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[New] technologies are currently being viewed as either substitutes for, or possible augmentations of, human faculties. I argue that the proffered scenarios of computerized ‘help’ for human activities evident in the ubiquitous computing world tends to focus on augmentation of human remembering, with sensors and computer networks archiving vast amounts of data, but neglects to consider what augmentation might mean when it comes to that other human activity, namely, forgetting. (5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.contemplativecomputing.org/2011/12/forgetting-as-a-feature-not-a-bug.html&#34;&gt;www.contemplativecomputing.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Soojung-Kim Pang is reading an article by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.idc.ul.ie/people/liam-bannon&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Liam Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Interaction Design Centre at the University of Limerick, on forgetting as a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started down the path of thinking about how computers currently handle the process of forgetting, and as part of that better understand what kind of metaphors are missing for the task of augmenting forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the notion of &amp;quot;garbage collection&amp;quot;, when unwanted memory is reclaimed. That process relies on a way of marking unwanted (computer) memory as forgettable. Every so often the garbage collection process runs, slowing down the system as it does, and cleaning up the mess left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers also have the notion and defect of a &amp;quot;memory leak&amp;quot;, where unwanted memory accumulates in a state where it&amp;#39;s taking up space but not really doing anything. A slow memory leak in a long running process will eventually bring a system down as more and more system resources are absorbed and never freed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When memory does go bad in a computer world, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;bitrot&amp;quot; - think about old tapes that have glitch errors, or more importantly old computer programs that have a hard time digesting new formats of data. This often happens when a new and improved technology foregoes compatibility with old formats, with the clean slate being easier to build from rather than re-encrufting some old system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing has its own feature of forgetting, in the &amp;quot;sunset&amp;quot; phase of an online service where unpopular, unprofitable, or unendearing features or services get deliberately turned off. If you had relied on that system for your external memory you are in for a rude surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worrisome aspect of computer memory is its binary nature, where a single transient glitch can render mass storage unreadable, and so rather than the healthy forgetting of the human brain you get sudden unrecoverable failure. Your carefully pickled up thoughts or rolodex full of context vanishes, and suddenly you have to rely on your mental rolodex rather than the paper or electronic one to recall details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discardia for Spring 2011 runs from March 20 to April 3</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Discardia is a holiday to celebrate and teach letting go of what doesn’t add value to your life – whether a physical object, habit, or emotional baggage – and replacing it with what makes your world more awesome. (&lt;strong&gt;Dinah Sanders&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each quarter I celebrate the modern holiday of&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.discardia.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Discardia&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#0160;This quarter&amp;#39;s Discardia runs from&amp;#0160;March 20 (the vernal equinox) to April 3 (the new moon).&amp;#0160;Here&amp;#39;s some of the things I did with my kids this Discardia season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My younger son wanted a new LEGO set, but all of his current LEGO bricks are scattered hither and yon. After much shopping at the hardware store, we ended up with a multi-compartment portable storage box. Now the boys can sort through the LEGO they have and find the parts they want to build their own custom creations, instead of asking me if they can buy a new set. It made cleaning up the living room a lot more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The season of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/&#34;&gt;discardia&lt;/a&gt; is upon us again. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time to unsubscribe from mailing lists, take out the trash, empty out your pockets, weigh your inbox and reduce its weight, clean out the cupboards and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also time for me to stop even pretending that I can follow everything that have at one time been interested in and let some things that fascinate me slip by the wayside for a while, so that in some future I can come back to them and be surprised by how much progress has been made since I was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My one purchase for this discardia season is going to be a digital scale, so that I can give a number to just how much crud I have sitting in front of me and measure the progress of removing it. &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;heave ho,&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metagrrrl.com/discardia/&#34;&gt;Discardia&lt;/a&gt; is a four times a year holiday that celebrates letting go, getting rid of, and removing unneeded things from your life.&amp;#0160; It&amp;#39;s one of my favorite modern holidays, one of those repeated reminders that there are sometimes things that you have gathered into your life that need to be scattered around instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority one is a book purge; I&amp;#39;ll be filling up a few bags with books to get out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority two is an internet purge, looking at the online services that absorb time (and money some times) and seeing which ones I can do without.&amp;#0160; This means that every single email that comes into the inbox for the next few days gets the query &amp;quot;how do I get rid of this&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority three is a kitchen purge, looking at the emergency cupboard for the food that will never be eaten by us and should be donated, and looking for spare utensils and containers that could go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Properly done, this is a year round effort, the sort of effort that has a box in your house that is the designated spot to send things off to the Reuse Center or some other organized recycling process.&amp;#0160; With two kids around the house the natural tendency is towards unmitigated clutter, but there&amp;#39;s some way to counteract that.&lt;/p&gt;
