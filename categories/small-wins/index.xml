He has a talk here from 2012 about the &#34;motivation wave&#34; and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low.</description>
