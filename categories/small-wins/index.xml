      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have written about here previously about Stanford researcher BJ Fogg in the context of his &#34;Tiny Habits&#34; project. He has a talk here from 2012 about the &#34;motivation wave&#34; and how software and systems that are are looking to facilitate behavior change need to recognize that people have the ability to do hard things only every so often, and thus they need to build in structures that let people do easy things that are still on-task when their motivations are low. The challenge is to get people to do things when they are motivated that allow them to expand their capacity to be on task when they are not motivated, e.g. by making it possible for them to get small and easy wins and tiny successes when their personal motivation is at a low ebb. &lt;/p&gt;
