    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Blogging is easy. All you have to do is write twice a day without any direction and stay on target until you find out what the target was. Everyone who writes a blog struggles with the tension between staying on focus and writing whatever you damn well please. Without an editor to nix your worst impulses, you can easily go far, far astray from whatever initial impulse brought you to writing and whatever attractive topic led you to have readers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-23-blogging-is-easy/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Mack Collier has an amazing post about how to write amazing posts. (Here, go read it.) I'm here to tell you why to listen to his advice but not to write like he does. Collier calls for an amped-up style of blog writing, one that is full of lists and awesome photographs and cheerleading enthusiasm. That's a good style to recognize, and you'll see it in some of the most popular parts of the web - the Buzzfeed or Upworthy style, with headlines like "New Dads Learned One Weird Tip To Make Their Blogs POP!" These are interesting and amazing the way a slow-motion televised car chase is amazing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-12-08-how-to-write-amazing-posts-every-time-and-why-you-shouldnt/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Publish quickly. The network rewards the first person to show up on the scene to describe what is going on, and it&#39;s important to get a version of that story underway promptly.&#0160; Edit at leisure.&#0160;The editing process takes time, and it shouldn&#39;t be unduly rushed. If necessary, work at it one paragraph at a time, and publish each paragraph after it is finished. Every single piece of work can be improved at any time by an edit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-03-19-first-version-coherent/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>This seems to be a plausible strategy - people send you interesting things that you want to remember, so you post them to your blog so that when you search for them you find them. If the blog seems overful of cut and paste of events sometimes, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m necessarily going to be going to all of them - who can do that with two kids at home! - but that it seemed like the best way to deal with an influx of details. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-06-02-on-emptying-your-inbox-into-your-blog/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Typepad says that I have 2,000 posts in this weblog. &#0160;Some of them, to be sure, are drafts that were abandoned, and some are scheduled in the future, but that&#39;s as good a round number as I need to reflect on blogging (the practice and the habit). I&#39;ve been blogging since April 1999; here&#39;s the first month or so of posts. &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;They were edited oh so patiently with vi, and at the time the genre was new enough that I could say with confidence &quot;Huh, this daily weblog stuff is too hard. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-02-24-2000-posts-and-ten-years-later-what-have-i-learned-from-blogging/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>This advice goes back as far as Usenet, and really is about managing the comments in your weblog.&nbsp; And it's simple advice: don't post any comments to your blog that you find inappropriate. This means filtering out spam, either by hand or (better) with the help of spam fighting tools; it means taking fake comments from people who are paid to post them and neutering them of their commercial value; and it means taking your angry, abusive critics off your page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-09-bloggers-secr-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One in an occasional series on secrets to blogging. If your site is like mine, it gets a sizable fraction of its readership from people who type things into the main Google search index and click through. More than half the traffic comes from that, and on a typical day 80%+ of the visitors are new. Search traffic coming from other search engines are relatively small, almost to the level of being noise - even though, for some search terms, the arguably 'best answer' for those searches is not anything I wrote but some targeted, focused search in some other database other than GOOG. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-1/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>One in an occasional series on the secrets of blogging. The longer that you have been blogging, the more materials you have accumulated, and the more things you have written that may possibly attract search traffic. By tuning into this effect you can get distant early warning of when people are interested in topics that are seasonal, and start work on them before they hit mainstream news and media.&nbsp; Your cumulative advantage is not just that you've done your homework last year, but that you know when people are starting to be interested in seasonal things. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-09-05-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>&quot;Write well, write often, and write with passion.&quot; (Jack Shedd) Jack has more in a rant that&#39;s making the rounds; the opposite of the great weblog is the &quot;cheese food manufacturing&quot; that Merlin Mann observes as dominating the world of &quot;pro bloggers&quot;. In some sense, this triple of {well, often, with passion} echoes the computer systems lament of {better, faster, cheaper} - &quot;pick any two&quot; is the easiest answer. It&#39;s possible to write often and well, but what you get is a wire service, with a style guide that homogenizes the passion right out of the system.&#0160;Writing well and with passion and not often gives you an occasional lovely essay but not enough page views to get ads worth anything. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-07-22-the-bloggers-se/">&raquo;</a></p>
