    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Midland G-227 GMRS radio, quantity two, a gift from the Wells-Becker Motorcycle Emporium in Dexter, Michigan. I replaced batteries in both of them, they take 4xAAA. Radio 1 successfully hears static when the (M) monitor button is depresssed; Radio 2 hears nothing. A manual is at http://www.manualslib.com/manual/396326/Midland-G-225.html which describes the frequencies of the 22 channels it can transmit on. A reasonable next step is to get my NooElec SDR tuner out and see if I can monitor a transmission. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-midland-g-227/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Some notes before I try to do the build. The parts I have or know I can get: cheap earbud headphones, NooElec NESDR Mini 2 SDR tuner stick with whip antenna, Nokia 635 phone, antenna from an older NESDR Mini SDR tuner stick. Parts I need: a short adapter cable that provides antenna in for the SDR stick as a headphone jack socket. The SDR tuner comes with an antenna, but I want to replace it with a dipole - especially one cut to have a center point for FM broadcast on 88.3 (WCBN) and a second one for 2 meter ham radio on local repeaters (W8UM on 145.23 and N8DUY on 145.15). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-29-building-a-dipole-antenna-for-your-sdr-tuner-stick-from-an-old-set-of-headphones/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>From the fix-it-yourself department, two successful radio repairs in one day. For my dad's old Kenwood R-2000, a replaced 100ma 5x20mm fuse brought it back to life. The antenna fuse search took a rather long time to get started, but the help of the UMARC club and Dean KD8VXR was enough to unearth the right part. For reference the Mouser part number is 693-0034.3107 for a Schurter fuse. For my old Sony ICF-2010, a fresh set of AA batteries for the computer was enough to get it going again. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-05-17-two-repaired-shortwave-receivers-in-one-day-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>As seen with gqrx on my Mac. The readout on the radio says 145.2169 Mhz instead of 145.2300 Mhz, I think that means the receiver has drifted 16.1 KHz from peak, or perhaps the listed frequency is not what I'm looking at. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-04-19-w8um-14523-repeater-for-sunday-night-net-19-april-2015/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>A couple of years ago, I got one of the first-generation RTL-SDR USB software defined radio units. These inexpensive devices are originally designed as TV tuners, but clever radio hackers figured out how to turn them into software-defined radios that tune to a broad spectrum of radio. After some experimental use I managed to cook the original unit which in its death throes no longer listened. The vendor (Nooelec) generously offered a modest discount on my next purchase, so I took them up on the 2d generation unit. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-03-30-plane-spotting-some-quick-notes-on-a-new-software-defined-radio-setup/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Radio Havana Cuba was one of my cold war era shortwave radio presets. I don't have a working shortwave radio of my own any more, and the miracle of the Internet means that you can now tune in broadcasts directly from the broadcaster without the inconvenience of shortwave tuning. The best way really to listen to a station like R Havana Cuba is via shortwave. Here are a couple of ways that you can do that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-12-17-listening-to-radio-havana-cuba-via-shortwave/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Echolink is a system that lets amateur radio operators transmit from their computer, through a relay at a suitable Echolink server.

        <p>I&#39;m fond of TuneIn, a free service that lets you tune in to radio broadcasts from all over the world. I used it last night to listen to Pacific Coast League AAA baseball, and I&#39;ve previously tuned in hockey games, news stations from far-away places when there&#39;s breaking news, and the occasional music channel. One of the remarkable things about TuneIn is that they have program schedules for the stations they are following, and so you can get real time updates for what&#39;s playing now and who&#39;s playing whom. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-10-tunein-listen-to-broadcast-radio-from-all-over-the-world/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A sample screen grab from tonight&#39;s W8UM net on 145.23. Please note that the radio I&#39;m using looks like it&#39;s out of tune a little bit, since I&#39;m actually listening here on 145.217. It was a good clear strong signal (the red/yellow line), even with the not very good antenna I have; it should be, since the transmitter is only about a mile from here. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-02-what-the-w8um-net-looks-like-in-software-defined-radio/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I&#39;ve started looking into software defined radio for Mac OS X. The goal is to take a cheap USB stick, plug it in to the Mac, and have it connect to software that will decode radio signals. So far there&#39;s nothing obvious that&#39;s packaged as a single collection of software plus hardware, but that&#39;s not surprising. My best notes to date are from Pinboard&#39;s t:sdr tag, which looks like it has a few dozen people sharing links. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-04-20-software-defined-radio-sdr-for-mac-os-x/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>One of my favorite radio shows is from an utterly obscure low power AM radio station in Hamtramck, which puts out an ultra lofi low power over-the-air signal on AM 1610 and a digital broadcast on http://am1610.org . The show is &quot;The Strait&quot;, which features Detroit electronic vinyl. It&#39;s on Saturday nights from 10:00 p.m. to midnight, and it&#39;s always worth a listen.&#0160; Some day I&#39;ll get to Hamtramck and do an air check and make sure I can actually tune this in - I don&#39;t know if they cover the whole city or just a piece of it. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-16-the-strait-am-1610-the-station-detroit-electronic-vinyl-on-saturday-nights-10-pm-to-midnight/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>My friend Dan KB6NU&#0160;was network control for the W8UM net tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern&#0160;(145.230 MHz, -600 kHz shift, 100 Hz PL). This was my first try at being on for the net, and so I waited patiently until my radio started making noises other than static. After most everyone else checked in, I hit the transmit button and gave my call sign (KD8OQG) and was acknowledged by Dan.&#0160; Among other things discussed tonight: The Amateur Radio Relay League&#39;s Logbook of the World; Where to get amateur radio gear in Hawaii, for someone traveling there; The Monday, November 19 2012 performance of the Michigan Youth Symphony Orchestra at Hill Auditorium.&#0160; I mostly listened, but it was an enjoyable hour spent, and it&#39;s always good to tune in to a good discussion. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-18-listening-to-and-participating-in-the-w8um-net-for-sunday-november-18-2012/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>CBC&#39;s Radio 2 has 5 channels of online music going at any time, reflecting the need to provide programming from the Atlantic Time Zone to the Pacific Time Zone. Newfoundland, a half hour east of the Atlantic Time Zone, gets a shout out from time to time but not its own time slot. It&#39;s nice to have a choice of five channels, because sometimes you want to have mid-day classical music, and some days you want to have afternoon popular music, and in this way you can just time-shift your listening all from the same page. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-10-02-listening-to-five-channels-of-cbc-radio-2/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Global Tuners is a worldwide project for people to share their shortwave radio receivers. There are about 50 tuners around the world, and once you create an account you can log in to each of them, change the tuning settings, and listen to the broadcasts that can be heard in that part of the world. I have an old shortwave set that was my stepdad&rsquo;s, and so I&rsquo;ve been trying to pull in stations from home. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-14-global-tuners-listening-to-far-off-radio-stations/">&raquo;</a></p>

Here&#39;s a map of the telemetry that was visible through APRS.FI&#0160;for the duration of the launch. The device is identified as KC8SBA. Note that for some reason tracking didn&#39;t pick up until a few minutes after the launch, and the tracking was also silent for a while until just before the descent. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-06-08-chasing-the-elusive-weather-balloon/">&raquo;</a></p>
