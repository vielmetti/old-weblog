      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a ham radio field day event. The people were friendly, but the focus was on the contests they were working on. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the part of the hobby I&#39;m most interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest setup seems so incredibly inefficient. If the goal is to make the maximum number of two way connections in the minimum amount of time, you&#39;d think that there would be more efficient ways to do it than to throw your call sign out on some frequency that&#39;s hopefully both being listened to at the moment but also not being transmitted on at the same time. It feels really noisy and unnecessarily difficult. I am told that some contesters use software defined radio to watch more of the band - that seems more effective than just listening to one narrow channel and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&#39;m much more used to using repeaters than I am to simplex operations. With a repeater at least you have a positive acknowledgement that your transmission was received by a machine, and with that you can get a better sense for what you sound like on the air. I&#39;m also used to a station acting as &#34;net control&#34; and acknowledging people and managing the flow of conversations. In contrast the contest sounds like chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever the unfamiliarity is, the other reality is that to listen to it, contests can be pretty boring. People give out the barest of bare minimum of information about their station and then move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Field Day brings to mind is a much more interesting event I was a little part of last year, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nj2bb.org/museum/&#34;&gt;Museum Ships Weekend Event&lt;/a&gt; run by The Battleship New Jersey Amateur Radio Station NJ2BB. I went to the Hands-On Museum in early June 2014 and listened and talked to shipboard radio stations on museum ships around the world. It was a lot more fun because the station operators were less concerned about maximizing the count of their contacts and more interested in telling the stories of their museums. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dan KB6NU for these details of Field Day in Ann Arbor June 27-29 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for Field Day, It will be at the Ann Arbor Airport, near the soccer fields.  We&#39;ll be setting up antennas on Friday night, breakfast is at Mark&#39;s Midtown Coney Island down on State at 8 am Saturday, more setup will commence after breakfast, operating will start at 2pm Saturday and run through 2pm Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll fill in with more details when I have them; I hope to get involved in the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3220083&#34;&gt;KD8OQG&lt;/a&gt;, my ham radio call sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it most frequently on Sunday nights, for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umich.edu/~umarc/net/net.html&#34;&gt;W8UM net&lt;/a&gt; (145.230 MHz, -600 kHz shift, 100 Hz PL) every Sunday at 8 PM Eastern run by the University of Michigan Amateur Radio Club.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming your new radio with CHIRP</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-24-programming-your-new-radio-with-chirp/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-11-24-programming-your-new-radio-with-chirp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home&#34;&gt;CHIRP web site&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that rather than learning the peculiarities of your radio&#39;s programming interface, you use CHIRP which has access to databases like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radioreference.com&#34;&gt;Radio Reference&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.repeaterbook.com/&#34;&gt;RepeaterBook&lt;/a&gt; to find the channels you want to have easy access to. Programming the device should just be a matter of loading in the set you want, attaching your radio to your computer via a programming cable, and selecting &#34;Upload to Radio&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new radio is on its way, so I&#39;ll update this when I get it to work! So far the application was easy to install (you have to install a Python runtime on OS X before it works) and it was easy to get the Washtenaw county repeater list from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.repeaterbook.com/&#34;&gt;RepeaterBook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATED: It worked the first time! Here&#39;s what I had to do to make it go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, before you upload channels to your radio, you have to download its current configuration. This gets all of the settings out of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, after you are done uploading the channels, unplug the programming cable from the radio. This should be obvious? but somehow it wasn&#39;t. Once I unplugged things everything worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, make sure that you pick the right radio that you are connecting to or else unpredictable things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the walk-through at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.miklor.com/COM/UV_CHIRP.php&#34;&gt;Miklor&#39;s CHIRP Software Guide&lt;/a&gt; to be useful and helpful, and it suggested some additional features (like setting channels to be receive-only) that will probably get me to re-program the radio a few times before I&#39;m done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What the W8UM net looks like in software defined radio</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sample screen grab from tonight&amp;#39;s W8UM net on 145.23. Please note that the radio I&amp;#39;m using looks like it&amp;#39;s out of tune a little bit, since I&amp;#39;m actually listening here on 145.217.&lt;/p&gt;
