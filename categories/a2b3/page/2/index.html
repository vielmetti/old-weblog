        <p>Today is a Twitter conference, so Twitter is full of good stuff people have been saving up.&#0160; Here&#39;s one: a &quot;conversation prism&quot; in bright happy colors showing a set of categories of tools, and how each one of them is occupied by some set of applications.&#0160; Here&#39;s a mapping of each of them onto the set of tools that I am using to keep a2b3 loosely connected.&#0160; Sorry no links, didn&#39;t have time to hyperlink everything The Conversation Prism by Brian Solis and Jesse Thomas Forums: Yahoo Groups This is the biggest single tool I use for group continuity; it perhaps reflects my elderly nature that email is the first system rather than web-based forums or modern social networks.&#0160; All I can say in my defense is that Usenet would have been better but it&#39;s really not available, and that I have 10 years of continuous use into Yahoo Groups and they haven&#39;t ruined it (yet). <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-27-the-conversation-prism-as-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-a2b3-lunch/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>On Thursday May 22 I had lunch with the a2b3 group for the 183d time.&#0160; I&#39;m writing that down as though it was a perfectly accurate number, just so that next week I can look it up and say that it will be the 184th time. Every week I host lunch on Thursdays at Eastern Accents in Ann Arbor.&#0160; People start showing up at 11:30 or so, most everyone has ordered and sat down and pulled up however many tables we need by noon, and at 12:30 someone bangs on a glass and I stand up and give roughly this presentation.&#0160; This week it felt like Groundhog Day, where I was the Bill Murray character practicing piano lessons over and over again until I really was the person who was good at hosting lunch for 30 instead of someone wondering whether I could pull off hosting lunch more than once. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-05-22-a2b3-nonsummary-for-22-may-2009/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>every once in a while you have to look at the net to see what other people say that you are. so here's that search for a2b3. First, all the things that don't relate to the lunch meeting: A2B3 is a rare genotype resulting from the inheritance of both A and B genes on one chromosome. The p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein inhibits a2b3 integrin-mediated cell spreading on vitronectin by blocking PKC-dependent localization of a2b3 to focal contacts Unicode Character 'YI SYLLABLE CIEX' (U+A2B3) These two transcripts differ by 75 bp and the protein that is coded by a2b3 has 25 amino acids more. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2008/2008-05-23-what-is-a2b3-ge/">&raquo;</a></p>
