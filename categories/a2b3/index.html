            <p>Nice lunch today at the Blue Nile. We had 10 people for lunch, including two people (Azita Azadi and Tom Meloche) who had moved back to town from far away. I had the vegetarian plate which was delicious (love me some injera).
The question of the day was regarding postcards, something I&rsquo;m thinking about quite a bit. With a modest (but still too big) amount of effort I can launch a postcard from the command line of my Mac. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-30-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Eight of us met for lunch at Ayse&rsquo;s today. It was a normal Thursday in that regard, as that&rsquo;s a pretty typical size for the lunch group these days.
We talked at question time about how we get big chunks of time to work on projects. One answer was to work early in the morning or late at night when there were fewer distractions. Gyll, a remodeling contractor, mentioned the use of checklists to make sure that the things that needed to get done got done. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-16-a2b3-lunch-at-ayses/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I wrote up a piece about how you might rewrite your resume to provide a "retcon" ("retroactive continuity") treatment, which emphasizes reinterpreting past events in such a way that they look like part of a story with a narrative arc.
That got me to thinking about lunch, of course, and the little hoary old story I tell about when the a2b3 group started "8 years ago". And I realize now that I can trace back continuity way longer than that. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-11-25-years-of-professionals-eating-lunch-together-on-a-regular-basis/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Developed in 2008 by Brian Solis, The [Conversation Prism] is a visual map of the social media landscape. Itâ€™s an ongoing study in digital ethnography that tracks dominant and promising social networks and organizes them by how theyâ€™re used in everyday life.
In 2009, I wrote up how the a2b3 lunch organizes itself through the eye of the this system. I ran across it again, and decided to do a repeat. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-30-the-2014-conversation-prism-seen-through-the-eyes-of-the-a2b3-lunch/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>The weekly a2b3 lunch met at Madras Masala on this the third Thursday of March. It's been our habit to meet at Madras on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays. The dining room is large and could seat a large party, but our typical lunch has rarely less than 6 and rarely more than 8 people there, which is just about perfect.
This week's tally was 6, which is just barely big enough to justify a formal round of introductions, but we did it anyway. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-21-a2b3-lunch-non-summary-for-march-20-2014/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>I've started using Meetup.com to organize several groups. Here's some notes.
For the longest time I've used a Yahoo Groups list to organize the a2b3 group, and that long-lived mailing list continues. It's great to have a mailing list, but it's kind of chatty as a lunch-planning-only effort. So the first of my Meetup groups is the a2b3 meetup which is solely devoted to the tasks of providing an events listing and (most importantly) to plan lunch. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-24-notes-on-meetup/">&raquo;</a></p>

At 12:30pm someone will note the time and then I'll make a round of introductions and ask a question to prompt conversation. We've had as many as 8 people for lunch and as few as 4 at Madras Masala, but the restaurant is flexible and if we were to get a huge crowd there's space. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-09-11-a2b3-september-12-2013-meetup/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>A slow moving version of Twitter: always hand write your tweets before sending them.

Bright idea? Write it down, photograph it, transcribe it, then (and only then) post to the network.
It's OK to wait quite a long time between initial idea and eventual posting. This also works for blog postings, or at least it should. Twitter happens to make it easy to do in one step for short posts. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-03-28-a-slow-moving-version-of-twitter-always-hand-write-your-tweets-before-sending-them/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>ANN ARBOR (Monday, February 18, 2013)
From a news release from Carol Sun of Eastern Accents.&#0160;
Eastern Accents will be closing its doors for good at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 16, 2013 (end of the day). &#0160;A long-simmering dispute with our landlord has finally come to a head, and weâ€™ve decided that it is time for change.

I asked people how they stayed warm. They dress in layers, use solar thermal heating, wear sweaters, wear hats, huddle under electric blankets, and all manner of good adaptive Michigan behavior.

            <p>Thanks to Patricia F. Anderson for this non-summary of the November 29, 2012 A2B3 lunch at Eastern Accents.&#0160;
Hi, folk!
Yesterday saw a decent sized group for lunch, roughly a dozen.&#0160;Conversation was, as usual, fascinating and diverse.
General conversation included the search for a proper formalmythological &quot;Muse&quot; or Goddess as a kind of patron saint of geeks and&#0160;code monkeys. A suggestion was Seshat, the Egyptian goddess of
measurement, mathematics, and librarianship, known for her&#0160;seven-pointed headdress and leopardskin dress. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-11-30-a2b3-non-summary-for-november-29-2012-/">&raquo;</a></p>

In no particular order, we talked about the +a2b3 Amateur Radio Club (with Dan Romanchik as the likely point of contact), since we had a couple of people who were online listening to +Skywarn for the last tornado.

            <p>The a2b3 group met at Eastern Accents this Thursday, June 2, 2011. Here&#39;s a summary of sorts.
I took notes in a quadrille notebook   for the meeting, as an exercise in trying to keep better track of what was happening. The book is similar to what became popular on the University of Michigan campus during the 1980s, when university president and nuclear engineer James Duderstadt would bring quad notebooks to meetings, and everyone else followed suit quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-06-02-a2b3-meeting-non-summary-june-2-2011/">&raquo;</a></p>

Almost every week for the last 4 years I&#39;ve been organizing a Thursday lunch.&#0160; It started with 4 people, and the mailing list now has almost 400; our record attendance at lunch was 41 but the typical table size is much like today, with 22 people sitting around a long table plus one person who came late sitting by themselves.&#0160; As with any mostly-open lunch series, you get to know people bit by bit over time, and some people take a few weeks to gain the confidence to describe who they are to a group of strangers. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-09-a2b3-lunch-nonsummary-day-8/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>Not a summary of what was said, but more of some observations on process.
Lunch was incredibly full today - we had upwards of 30, filled one entire side of the restaurant plus a second table of four.&#0160; And becuase I asked a question that allowed a long answer, it took a full hour to get through everyone, and some people left early.
In some sense that&#39;s OK, if you believe in the open space &quot;law of two feet&quot;, and if you think that whoever shows up are the right people. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2009/2009-07-03-a2b3-nonsummary-for-july-2-2009-how-to-introduce-lots-of-people/">&raquo;</a></p>
