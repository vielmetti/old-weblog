      <description>From the Frog Blog: Cold weather leads to price hikes (1/9/2009)
Blueberries--now for some good news. Blueberry prices hit rock bottom this weekend. I can&amp;#39;t imagine they could get this cheap in the winter. Prices could be as low as $15 per case. 
I&amp;#39;ll be following the twitter stream of EuroFruit to get more details as well; country of origin might be Chile?
