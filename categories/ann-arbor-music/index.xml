      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Papillon is working on a double album &#34;Calligraphy&#34; which he&#39;s producing with the help of an Indiegogo campaign. Of this he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I have traveled to many places, through many cultures and created music with many people on our planet.  This resulted in the Calligraphy collection to be released on a double album later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The next few steps of the way will require a small push from my community of dreamers, makers and supporters. &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“You want to know my tricks?  How I keep from losing my mind. /
  Basically, I just remember I’m not one of a kind. /
  I connect to as many artists as I can find that are genuine /
  And that know our mission’s divine.”
  (Lyrics from “My Truth”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
