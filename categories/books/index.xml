      <title>The weak ties of your social network are its greatest strength</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lior Zoref has a new book out called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1471756&#34;&gt;Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything&lt;/a&gt;
(Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have
a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the
new shelf at Mallett&amp;rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday
afternoon. Mallett&amp;rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot
to be on a warm day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://media.aadl.org/covers/1471756_200.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits
without repeating the author&amp;rsquo;s technique of using the word
&amp;ldquo;Mindsharing&amp;rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to
unpack the approach with a simpler version of the
strategy, which seems to boil down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make lots of connections online, even with people who you don&amp;rsquo;t
know very well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them really good questions when you are trying to make a decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of connections is the biggest suggestion here; rather than
get help from a small circle of trusted friends, the crowdsourcing
approach to human improvement relies on good ideas coming from
large or very large sets of people (at least 250), and relies on
pulling in unexpectedly good recommendations from people who don&amp;rsquo;t
know you very well.  Lior references Mark Granovetter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Strength
of Weak Ties&amp;rdquo; (1973) early on, but of course Granovetter didn&amp;rsquo;t
know about Quora, Facebook, LinkedIn, and the host of other online
properties and lists that allow for computer-mediated interaction
with people at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an art to asking good questions that could fill a book.
If you look on the biggest question-answering websites like Quora
or Stack Exchange and start to follow along, you will quickly find
that good questions get rewarded with positive feedback and bad
questions (or impossible to answer questions) get ignored or criticized.
Lior points out the there&amp;rsquo;s a very big difference between typing a query
into a search engine and asking a live audience the same thing -
the human element of the search allows a personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lior is known for a TED talk (he brought an ox onstage) and is out
promoting his book. The book itself feels like an ideal airplane
read for someone who is aspiring to self-improvement, is facing a
career change, and who hasn&amp;rsquo;t figured out what the point is quite
yet with Facebook as a career tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Books I&#39;ve requested for the Ann Arbor District Library</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-07-books-ive-requested-for-the-ann-arbor-district-library/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ann Arbor District Library is really quite good about getting copies of new books for its bookshelves. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/contactus&#34;&gt;request a title&lt;/a&gt; online, and very few reasonable requests for in-print materials available from publishers are turned down. (I haven&#39;t tried the equivalent for self-published books, but I suspect it&#39;s harder; that would be a good question.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, requesting a book does not immediately add you to the request list for the book, so you need to keep a task alive to search for the title or author in the hopes that it shows up soon enough (with &#34;0 copies owned&#34;, so it&#39;s on order but not yet arrived) for you to be on the list quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the books I&#39;ve requested that I hope are going to make it to the bookshelves soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Granger&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1456844&#34;&gt;The digital mystique : how the culture of connectivity can empower your life&lt;/a&gt; - I&#39;ve been looking forward to this ever since Sarah started working on it. It promises to be a concise guide into how to apply digital communications to real-world every day living. I&#39;m 4th of 4 holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Parzybok&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://smallbeerpress.com/forthcoming/2014/03/31/sherwood-nation/&#34;&gt;Sherwood Nation&lt;/a&gt;  - &#34;Sherwood Nation is a post-collapse non-apocalyptic novel! It is the story of the rise and fall of a micronation within a city. It is a love story, a war story, a grand social experiment, a treatise on hacking and remaking government, on freedom and necessity, on individualism and community.&#34; Not in the catalog yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegraph messenger boys : labor, technology, and geography, 1850-1950 / Gregory J. Downey. &#34;In Telegraph Messenger Boys Gregory J. Downey provides an entirely new perspective on the telegraph system: a communications network that revolutionized human perceptions of time and space. The book goes beyond the advent of the telegraphy and tells a broader story of human interaction with technology and the social and cultural changes it brought about.&#34; Requested via MELCAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, what books are you waiting for at the library?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>United America, divided media?</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-united-america-divided-media/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d91db21970d-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d91db21970d img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;United-america-150&#34; title=&#34;United-america-150&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d91db21970d-800wi&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.orgnet.com/divided.html&#34;&gt;book-buying habits show a schism&lt;/a&gt; between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you&#39;d think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/index.html&#34;&gt;Wayne Baker&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s new book &lt;a href=&#34;http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/wayneb/united-america.html&#34;&gt;United America&lt;/a&gt; looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. He has identified 10 beliefs that are widely held across political boundaries and uses this survey information to tell a story of how an shared American identity emerges from this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked with Dr. Baker the other day after having read the book. We discussed in more depth some of the survey techniques as well as our shared surprise at the results. What was most interesting was a discussion of which shared values did not make the cut. For example, he identifies &#34;symbolic patriotism&#34;, an emotional connection to the country triggered by the flag or the national anthem, as a shared value. What didn&#39;t make the cut was &#34;blind patriotism&#34;, an &#34;our country right or wrong&#34; point of view. That type of patriotic fervor showed a wide variety of responses across the American spectrum, whereas the symbolic and emotional response to national icons was much more uniform and common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is based on survey results that are in the publication process. More information about the survey and its surprising results are at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.OurValues.org&#34;&gt;www.OurValues.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A review of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d8b9061970d-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d8b9061970d img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;Social-physics&#34; title=&#34;Social-physics&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a73d8b9061970d-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of &lt;a href=&#34;http://socialphysics.media.mit.edu/\&#34;&gt;Social Physics&lt;/a&gt;: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people&#39;s cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. Quite evidently the populations they study live routine, predictable lives. (Perhaps we all do.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest criticism (&amp;amp; thus the non-recommendation for the book) is that the technologies for making these monitoring of human behavior that Pentland describes are dehumanizing and a grave insult to personal privacy. The authors vague promises of a personal data store that would broker our most personal information are unrealistic. If these plans pan out, we will always be watched over by machines that seek only to predict our patterns of behavior and exploit them. An &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/welcome-to-algorithmic-prison/283985/&#34;&gt;algorithmic prison&lt;/a&gt; awaits us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while the author describes unexpected behavior by individuals thus modeled, and betrays an element of surprise that we might step out of our everyday paths into something his system doesn&#39;t contain. It&#39;s a glimmer of hope in a dystopian world that we might surprise our ever-present overseers and do something that their social physics does not anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Having read a passage from a book, I then .... Rereading Benedikt&#39;s &#34;Cyberspace&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34;  style=&#34;float: right;&#34; href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c img-responsive&#34; alt=&#34;Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon&#34; title=&#34;Cyberspace-first-steps-cover-amazon&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef01a5115daf88970c-320wi&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it&#39;s easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya&#39;s &#34;How to Solve It&#34; (1945), David Sucher&#39;s &#34;City Comforts&#34; (2003), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbenedikt.com/&#34;&gt;Michael Benedikt&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s anthology &#34;Cyberspace: First Steps&#34; (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of books in a digital age is that they want to be a part of your every day reference use, so that you could rummage through them whenever you wanted to and have some sense of what was in them that could be used or reused. Books - unlike tweets - have gravity. They need space well beyond what the microchip could be used to store them, and they demand a certain carefulness so that you can&#39;t simply throw a dozen of them into your book bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about books is that they live on a bookshelf; and by doing so they are near their neighbors which helps you understand the next work you might want to read. Consider only one of these, Benedikt&#39;s &#34;Cyberspace&#34;. It&#39;s a wonderful book written at the very beginning of the era of the World Wide Web, yet it is completely untouched by The Web As We Know It Today. If there&#39;s anything of common use that defines it, it&#39;s the more fanciful and imagined virtual worlds of the MUD and MOO systems of its generation. In its uncommon manifestations its all about the otherworldly architecture of a generation of imagined but unbuilt online human-computer environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Cyberspace, and I want to put my stamp on my cyberspace to show that I have read it and to increase the chance that if I&#39;m stumbling upon the same ideas again that I will find it again. How to do this, in a way that&#39;s true to the work? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One simple technique is to anchor this essay with the words that will let me find it again. A Google search for &#34;vielmetti benedikt cyberspace&#34; should, by all expectations, find this again. That helps, but only if I remember the exact incantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more elaborate technique would be to note my interest in this book in various social reading systems, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504442.Cyberspace&#34;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; (which helpfully saves what page you are on) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.librarything.com/work/31259&#34;&gt;Librarything&lt;/a&gt; (which helpfully tags the work and suggests related). I could review it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262521776/ref=nosim/superpatron-20&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, though Amazon is most helpful for me in noting that if I ever lose my copy, that I can have another one for a penny plus postage and handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every work, there&#39;s some chance that an echo of it will be online too; &lt;a href=&#34;http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/nozgenalp/MCS490/Media.Culture.and.Technology-Readings/week.11-introduction.to.Cyberspace%20First%20Steps%20Benedikt.pdf&#34;&gt;IEU in Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has the introduction, as a reading for a Media Culture and Technology class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to know, though, is what are the contemporaries of this work, and its descendants. What was next to it on the shelf at Borders Store #1 when I pulled it off the shelf to buy it? Who will nod knowingly when I pull it out of my bookshelf, dust it off, and flip through to find some passage that I might remember? What should go next to it on my own shelves, real or imagined? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve carried around some of these texts for a long time. In some real world of the current cyberspace, I want to embed them so that I can find them again (so they can find me again) when I need them. What&#39;s more, they are not just ever-scrolling words on the infinite Internet scroll; they are real and unique objects that take up space and weigh something and that have bookmarks and notes in the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;noted as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interview with Benedikt in &lt;a href=&#34;http://gain2.aiga.org/content.cfm?Alias=michaelbenedikt&amp;amp;rca=michaelbenedikt1&amp;amp;pff=1&#34;&gt;AIGA&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time I was also lamenting that cyberspace—that wonderful, phantasmagoric three-dimensional alternative reality imagined by William Gibson—was not actually shaping itself on-line as I and many others thought it surely would. What Mosaic, then Netscape, then Explorer delivered was mostly the content of your local drugstore newsstand, but worse: delivered more jerkily, more shallowly, and more resolutely two-dimensionally—like paper flyers blown against the back of the computer screen. (99% of it still looks that way, Flash graphics notwithstanding.) Set aside the code-writing required: by 1993 it was clear that the transmission and processing speeds required to sustain cyberspace were going to be long in coming. They are still not here. To this day, only advanced intranet gamers have a foretaste of Gibsonian cyberspace: a real-time, shared, virtual space seamlessly mixing useful data, personal presence, and real-world, real-time connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Adam Grant, Give and Take; on being &#34;otherish&#34;</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-10-adam-grant-give-and-take/</link>

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-10-adam-grant-give-and-take/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997&#34;&gt;from the Ann Arbor District Library.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant likes givers, but recognizes that sometimes people give too much and never manage to get things in return. These selfless people tend to burn out when too many things go opposite to their interests. He opens up the opportunity to recognize a newly coined word &#34;otherish&#34; - an opposite of selfish where you consider both your interests and the others interests simultaneously. &#34;Otherish&#34; people are looking for win-win situations, as opposed to selfless people who end up in win-lose setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Givers are overrepresented at the top, as well as at the bottom, of most success measures.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/printer_friendly.cfm?articleid=3224&#34;&gt;interview with Adam Grant&lt;/a&gt; about the book is a 25 minute version which touches on several more high points of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Karl Pohrt died Wednesday, July 10, 2013, after a battle with anaplastic thyroid cancer. He wrote about books and life on his weblog &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thereisnogap.com/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;there is no gap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Karl was the owner of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arborwiki.org/Shaman_Drum&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Shaman Drum Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;, an independent bookstore on Ann Arbor&amp;#39;s State Street which closed in 2009 after a 29 year run.&lt;/p&gt;

He had a very strong sense of the material and spiritual value of the reading experience. He was a man with a mission and an unshakeable devotion to the idea that books could transform human beings and the world for the better,&amp;quot; said Bruce Joshua Miller of Miller Trade Marketing in Chicago.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

And Karl was one of the greatest managers ever. He assembled an amazing crew of employees, and did more for literature in Ann Arbor than the massive (also now defunct) competitor down the road . . .&amp;quot; Chad Post&lt;/p&gt;

He loved to travel and he adored his two daughters, Tanya and Tasha. Family meant the world to him and community...if you were in Karl&amp;#39;s world he was unstintingly loyal. If he loved a book, he&amp;#39;d make sure everyone knew about it. I loved to talk to him about books and always felt on top of the world when I presented him with something that he connected with--it was like a good luck charm for the book and the author!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A memorial service will be held for Pohrt on Sunday, July 14, at 2 p.m. at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation, 3257 Lohr Road, Ann Arbor. The family requests that donations be made to the church or to the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.childrensliteracynetwork.org/funds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Children’s Literacy Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bookgate in Urbana, Illinois at the Urbana Free Library</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-bookgate-in-urbana-illinois-at-the-urbana-free-library/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People in Urbana Illinois are up in arms that the Urbana Free Library director decided to discard a large portion of the library&amp;#39;s non fiction collection. Shelves were left bare after books older than 10 years old were summarily discarded. Citizens, up in arms after their library collection was decimated, &lt;a href=&#34;http://smilepolitely.com/culture/public_officials_do_not_have_the_luxury_of_lying/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;packed&lt;/a&gt; a library board meeting to demand answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true. The last is most critical for nonfiction, where old works in science or medicine can be misleading or even dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeding is one of those arcane skills that is taught in library school. (Back off, man, I&amp;#39;m a library scientist!) The problem happens when you don&amp;#39;t pay attention to a wide range of factors when looking at what to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own bookshelves get sorted through from time to time, and I count on the library to backstop my collection when it&amp;#39;s time to make room for new materials. It would be horrible to have that extra set of shelves full of books laid bare by an overzealous discard policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-18-reciprocity-give-and-take-a-little-bit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to reading&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.giveandtake.com/Home/AdamGrant&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Adam Grant&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; book&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aadl.org/catalog/record/1427997&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Give and Take&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;(aadl). &amp;#0160;Look in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-the-secret-to-getting-ahead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;March 31 NY Times Magazine for a preview&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a quote from the U of Michigan&amp;#39;s Jerry Davis. At the moment I&amp;#39;m&amp;#0160;33d on a list of 53 holds at the library for the book; if you&amp;#39;re generous, and have finished your copy, please lend it to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table of contents and blurb, from the AADL catalog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good returns: the dangers and rewards of giving more than you get -- The peacock and the panda: how givers, takers, and matchers build networks -- The ripple effect: collaboration and the dynamics of giving and taking credit -- Finding the diamond in the rough: the fact and fiction of recognizing potential -- The power of powerless communication: how to be modest and influence people -- The art of motivation maintenance: why some givers burn out but others are on fire -- Chump change: overcoming the doormat effect -- The scrooge shift: why a soccer team, a fingerprint, and a name can tilt us in the other direction -- Out of the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using his own cutting-edge research as a professor at Wharton Business School, Adam Grant shows how helping others can lead to greater personal success. He demonstrates how smart givers avoid becoming doormats, and why this kind of success has the power to transform not just individuals and groups, but entire organisations and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m particularly intrigued by the notion that there&amp;#39;s a distinction that creates &amp;quot;smart givers&amp;quot; that win some unspecified game through a generous strategy that pays off for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&#34;asset-img-link&#34; href=&#34;http://featherfiles.aviary.com/2013-05-10/f77694d11/3894658f4ab349e8a15a6557a69c1a31_hires.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Getimage&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb047b43970d&#34; src=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c4f1a53ef017eeb047b43970d-800wi&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; title=&#34;Getimage&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You run a library; it gets donations, from time to time, of books or other materials. Some of the donations are substantial and the donor is recognized. How to best recognize a donor in the digital age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach is the &amp;quot;virtual bookplate&amp;quot;, described in &lt;a href=&#34;http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/419.full&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;this ACRL article written by folks at the U of Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The catalog is extended to include graphics that honor the donor of the materials, and the search is extended to make it easy to look up all of the works that were donated by a particular individual. The story goes that a donor was so impressed at how easy it was to see a pretty view of what they had given to the library that they wrote a check on the spot to donate more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another perspective on this is the &amp;quot;virtual collection of bookplates&amp;quot;. The one of these that I&amp;#39;ve found is the&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/exlibris/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;John Starr Stewart Ex Libris Collection&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;at the University of Illinois, with over 1500 plates collected between 1903 and 1906. The University of Michigan plate in this post is from that collection.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing release notes for a new version of my Michigan FOIA book, using Leanpub</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is my&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/michigan-foia&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;No-Nonsense Guide to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;#39;m publishing (early) and updating (as its written) &lt;a href=&#34;http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/03/writing-and-publishing-early-with-leanpub.html&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;using Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;#39;s what I sent out to subscribers - all four of them! - this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy to have a chance to keep working on this, since even the smallest amount of money from new sales covers the direct costs &amp;#0160;of coffee to do the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release Notes
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;April 9, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This release updates the first 7 chapters of the book plus the introduction. Most of the changes are to fill in gaps, small reorganizations of the text, and line edits; there&amp;#39;s not a ton of new original materials. Chapters 8 through to the end are unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that&amp;#39;s new in the Michigan FOIA world is that Muckrock (Appendix A) now supports FOIA requests to a number of Ann Arbor cities. My first trial with this worked a little bit well, and I&amp;#39;m going to keep trying to improve how that system works so that I get the best writeup of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A document trove from a recent FOIA request is a log of all FOIA requests to the City of Ann Arbor over the span of two months. Look for a future set of edits to expand the &amp;quot;sample requests&amp;quot; considerably based on that collection, since I&amp;#39;m still digesting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has tried the &amp;quot;send to Kindle&amp;quot; feature, let me know how it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, if you have any questions, contact me at&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:edward.vielmetti@gmail.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;edward.vielmetti@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#0160;or&amp;#0160;&lt;a href=&#34;tel:%2B1%20734%20330%202465&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;+1 734 330 2465&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books</title>
      <link>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-23-librarything-as-a-shadow-catalog-for-books/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2012 17:16:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-23-librarything-as-a-shadow-catalog-for-books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&amp;#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&amp;#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. The Canton District Library does have an installation of LibraryThing for Libraries, their OPAC integration product, which lets you check availability of a book straight from LibraryThing. The lack of a direct link means that to find a book in the AADL that I have on my screen in LibraryThing I have to click a few more times. I suppose that&amp;#39;s ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to tag and categorize books that you don&amp;#39;t own yourself, but only have collected them from the library? There was a time when I tagged things everywhere I found them - photos on Flickr, web sites on Delicious - but these days that doesn&amp;#39;t seem so important. I like seeing other people&amp;#39;s tags, especially for works that are unfamiliar, but it hardly seems essential to do it for my own use unless there&amp;#39;s some list I&amp;#39;m trying to put together. When did tagging cease being fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m spending some of my time on the site deleting books that I no longer even remember having read or that I no longer wish to remember. That should result in better recommendations, and maybe a chance to reread something that would have been worth remembering. My use of the site peaked in 2008 so there&amp;#39;s not as much recent coverage as I&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from LibraryThing are really quite good, and they are even better for reflecting which of the books you&amp;#39;ve already read. The site generates ten recommendations based on other people&amp;#39;s reading patterns, and it reminds you that you&amp;#39;ve read some of the ones on that list with a checkmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I read more books and fewer web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got done reading Francis Spufford&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Red Plenty&amp;quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other reviews of the work, so that I don&amp;#39;t miss them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not SF. It’s not really&amp;#0160;&lt;em&gt;fiction&lt;/em&gt;, though it’s not non-fiction either. It’s something strangely between the two, a fictionalised non-fiction book about the Soviet Dream. Reading it partakes of some of the pleasures of reading especially geeky SF, and some of the pleasure of reading solid well-written nonfiction on a fascinating subject. It’s about history, economics, how technology and ideology interact, and how theory and practice are different, with examples. What it’s most like is reading an extended version of one of Neal Stephenson’s more adorable infodumps, only with footnotes and a proper end.&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crooked Timber put together a &lt;a href=&#34;http://crookedtimber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/RedPlenty.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Red Plenty reader&lt;/a&gt; with about a dozen essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2010/08/red_plenty_by_f.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Adam Roberts writes in Strange Horizons&lt;/a&gt;, a science fiction review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To take the first first. When people talk about &amp;quot;science fiction&amp;quot; the science they are thinking of (as it might be) physics, or chemistry, or perhaps biology. But that&amp;#39;s a narrow way of taking things. The science in&amp;#0160;&lt;cite&gt;Red Plenty&lt;/cite&gt;&amp;#0160;is economics, and reading the book will teach you a tremendous amount about the logic (and illogic) of running a planned economy on the Soviet scale. The speculative portion of the science here is the striking attempt by Vitalevich and Nemchinov to modify the catastrophically inflexible Soviet economic model with a mechanism—&amp;quot;shadow prices&amp;quot;—better able to match supply to demand without simply instituting Capitalist &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; markets. Perhaps it sounds dry, but I found it fascinating, and precisely as science-fictional as a proposed new spaceship drive or cloning technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
