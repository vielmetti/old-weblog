        <p>Lior Zoref has a new book out called Mindsharing: the art of crowdsourcing everything (Portfolio / Penguin, 2015). I have a copy of it from the Ann Arbor District Library which was on the new shelf at Mallett&rsquo;s Creek on a sunny and hot summer Sunday afternoon. Mallett&rsquo;s has good air conditioning, a very good spot to be on a warm day. The challenge of a book like this is picking out the good bits without repeating the author&rsquo;s technique of using the word &ldquo;Mindsharing&rdquo; (capitalized) at every opportunity. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2015/2015-07-19-weak-ties-of-your-social-network/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>The Ann Arbor District Library is really quite good about getting copies of new books for its bookshelves. You can request a title online, and very few reasonable requests for in-print materials available from publishers are turned down. (I haven't tried the equivalent for self-published books, but I suspect it's harder; that would be a good question.) Alas, requesting a book does not immediately add you to the request list for the book, so you need to keep a task alive to search for the title or author in the hopes that it shows up soon enough (with "0 copies owned", so it's on order but not yet arrived) for you to be on the list quickly. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-09-07-books-ive-requested-for-the-ann-arbor-district-library/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>If you look at American media you can see a sharp ideological divide. Television networks show notorious political biases, and book-buying habits show a schism between what those on the left read vs those on the right. If you looked only at media, you'd think that we lived in two countries, red and blue, with hardly anything shared between the two sides. Wayne Baker's new book United America looks at survey data from citizens across the country and comes to a different conclusions: that there are core American values that are common across the entirety of the political spectrum. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-16-united-america-divided-media/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A review of Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread — The Lessons from a New Science, Alex Pentland, 2014. Pentland and his research group have appeared to have discovered a simple model of human behavior with great predictive power. By snooping on people's cell phones, they can reduce typical human interactions into a set of interacting finite state machines, and by noticing just how regular those behavioral patterns are they think they understand ideas. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-03-09-a-review-of-social-physics-how-good-ideas-spread-the-lessons-from-a-new-science-alex-pentland/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>I'm rereading some books from my bookshelf, on the theory that it's easier to make sense of the static texts that I own than to try to dip into the infinite stream of the internet and be enlightened or entertained by it. So far, so good; I pulled out a copy of Polya's "How to Solve It" (1945), David Sucher's "City Comforts" (2003), and Michael Benedikt's anthology "Cyberspace: First Steps" (1991/1992), and enlightened myself with each. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2014/2014-01-28-having-read-a-passage-from-a-book-i-then-rereading-benedikts-cyberspace/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A brief review of Give and Take, which I checked out from the Ann Arbor District Library. Grant writes about a number of people he calls givers, who are generous to a fault when sharing their time and expertise, even when there is not a sure bet that the generosity will be repaid. He contrasts this with the matchers, who always keep track of favors, and the takers who seek to exploit every circumstance. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-08-10-adam-grant-give-and-take/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>People in Urbana Illinois are up in arms that the Urbana Free Library director decided to discard a large portion of the library&#39;s non fiction collection. Shelves were left bare after books older than 10 years old were summarily discarded. Citizens, up in arms after their library collection was decimated, packed a library board meeting to demand answers. Every library weeds old books from their shelves, partly to make room for new ones, partly to remove surplus copies of no longer popular titles, and partly to get rid of texts that are no longer accurate or true. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2013/2013-06-23-bookgate-in-urbana-illinois-at-the-urbana-free-library/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>350 words about LibraryThing as a shadow catalog for books. The bookshelf in my bedroom is full of books, thanks to LibraryThing. It&#39;s been a reliable source for recommendations for works that are the next one to read after I&#39;ve enjoyed a book. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to read a lot of them before they need to go back to the library. Unlike some other libraries, the Ann Arbor District Library doesn&#39;t have a direct connection to LibraryThing. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-23-librarything-as-a-shadow-catalog-for-books/">&raquo;</a></p>

    <section class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I just got done reading Francis Spufford&#39;s &quot;Red Plenty&quot;. In one modestly thick volume, it gave me insights into the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 1960s that an entire semester of college failed to give - the failures of central planning, the strange prices that led to strange decision making, and (most importantly) the optimism of the late 1950s when everything was humming along nicely. Some other reviews of the work, so that I don&#39;t miss them: Jo Walton: The Glorious, Terrible, Strange USSR: Francis Spufford’s&#0160;Red Plenty It’s not SF. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-12-09-red-plenty-francis-spufford/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Andrew Keen&#39;s Digital Vertigo is a follow-on to his earlier The Cult of the Amateur. Where his first work took on Wikipedia as the scourge of knowledge, the current work aims its sights at Facebook and LinkedIn, and is reflectively critical of the online social networks that Keen sees as more harmful than useful. With a lead-in like this, you might expect that this is one of those books that fits in a long history of media criticism - from Marshall McLuhan to Umberto Eco to Michel Foucault, you&#39;ll find a series of quips and quotes from dozens of thinkers littering the pages of Digital Vertigo. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2012/2012-05-22-digitalvertigo-by-ajkeen-/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>A collection of anti-Internet texts from the mid-1990s. Each of these were written at the point just as the net was unquestionably entering its stage of hyper-growth, absorbing more and more personal time as well as gobbling up independent networks into its own. The Internet As Hyper-Liberalism&#0160;(1996) argues against interconnectivity of networks. Net-ism is wrong because it is coercively expansionist. There is no inherent or inevitable technical or historical trend to a single communication network. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2011/2011-07-29-cyberspace-is-gone/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The challenge is to get rid of some set of books that have accumulated, while simultaneously fulfilling the need to always have some kind of new reading in the house. &#0160; A new (to me) way to do this is Paperback Swap, a system which works as a trading board for books. &#0160;You are entitled to books in the proportion that you send books to others, and every book you request is free to you. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-13-discardia-for-midsummer-2010-paperback-swap/">&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>An essay published in Open Letters Monthly. What concerns me about the literary apocalypse that everybody now expects—the at least partial elimination of paper books in favor of digital alternatives—is not chiefly the books themselves, but the bookshelf. My fear is for the eclectic, personal collections that we bookish people assemble over the course of our lives, as well as for their grander, public step-siblings. I fear for our memory theaters. <a class="read-more" href="http://vielmetti.github.io/post/2010/2010-07-12-nathan-schneider-defends-the-memory-theater/">&raquo;</a></p>
